##Game Mode

The GameMode Class is responsible for setting the rules of the game that is being played. The rules can include how players join the game, whether or not a game can be paused, level transitions, as well as any game-specific behavior (for example, win conditions).

##Gameplay Framework

The basic gameplay classes include functionality for representing players, allies, and enemies; as well as for controlling these avatars with player input or AI logic. There are also classes for creating heads-up displays and cameras for players. Finally, gameplay classes such as GameMode, GameState, and PlayerState set the rules of the game. Gameplay classes also track how the game and the players are progressing.

##GameState

The GameState contains information that you want replicated to every client in a game. Put simply, it is ‘The State of the Game’ for every connected player.

##Global Asset Picker

The Global Asset Picker (Ctrl-P) is a fast-access means of editing assets or bringing them into your levels. In some ways, it is similar to the Content Browser but without limiting itself to the current folder you have selected in the Asset Tree. Not only can you pull assets specific to your game, but also anything from Engine, like lights or sound emitters. Because it offers all available assets in a list format, it is not intended to be used as means for browsing. Instead, it’s perfect for those moments when you know the asset (or asset type) you need and just want to quickly type part of its name into the Search Line.

##Grass Tool

A tool to densely populate the Landscape Terrain used in a forest with grass, flowers, and small rocks.
