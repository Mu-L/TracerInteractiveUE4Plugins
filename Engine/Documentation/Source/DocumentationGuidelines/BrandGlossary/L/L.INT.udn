##Landscape

The Landscape system enables you to create terrain for your world - mountains, valleys, uneven or sloped ground, openings for caves - and easily modify both its shape and its appearance by using a range of tools.

##Landscape Mode

The Landscape system enables you to create terrain for your world - mountains, valleys, uneven or sloped ground, openings for caves - and easily modify both its shape and its appearance by using a range of tools.

##Level

A Level is a user defined area of gameplay. Levels are created, viewed, and modified by placing, transforming, and editing the properties of the Actors it contains. In the Unreal Editor, each Level is saved as a separate .umap file, which is also why you will sometimes see them referred to as Maps.

##Level Editor

Tools for viewing and editing levels. Container for many Editor functions.

##Level Sequence

The Level Sequence is the “container” for your cinematic scenes and must be created in order to begin working inside the Sequencer Editor.

##Level Streaming

The Level Streaming feature makes it possible to load and unload map files into memory as well as toggle their visibility during play. This makes it possible to have worlds broken up into smaller chunks so that only the relevant parts of the world are taking up resources and being rendered at any point. If done properly, this allows for the creation of very large, seamless levels that can make the player feel as if they are playing within a world that dwarfs them in size.

##Lightmass

Lightmass is the static global illumination system which creates lightmaps with complex light interactions, such as area shadowing and diffuse interreflection from stationary and static lights.
