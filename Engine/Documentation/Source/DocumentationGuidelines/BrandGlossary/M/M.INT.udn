##Material

A Material is an asset that can be applied to a mesh to control the visual look of the scene. At a high level, it is easiest to think of a Material as the “paint” that’s applied to an object. But even that can be a bit misleading, since a Material literally defines the type of surface from which your object appears to be made. You can define its color, its shininess, its transparency, and much more.

##Material Editor

The Material Editor provides the ability to create shaders for geometry, using a node-based graph interface.

##Material Instance

Material Instances are child Materials that use parameters to change the appearance of a Material without incurring an expensive recompilation of the Material.

##Matinee Editor

The Matinee animation tool provides the ability to animate the properties of Actors over time, to create either dynamic gameplay or cinematic in-game sequences. The system is based on the use of specialized animation tracks in which you can place keyframes to set the values of certain properties of the Actors in the level. The Matinee Editor is similar to the non-linear editors used for video editing, making it familiar to video professionals.

##Media Framework

The Media Framework enables playback of videos inside Unreal Engine.

##Media Player Window

The Media Player Window provides playback and preview functionality for any Media Source asset.

##Modes

Modes are tools that change the primary behavior of the Level Editor for a specialized task, such as placing new assets into the world, creating geometry brushes and volumes, painting on meshes, generating foliage, and sculpting landscapes.

##Modes Panel

The Modes panel provides access to the Editor Modes’s settings and tools.

##Module

Modules are containers for a collection of related classes that are compiled into a Dynamic-Link Library (DLL).
