From a lowly roach that hides from the light, to the Bot in Shooter Game that knows when to shoot, and when to seek health or ammo; **Behavior Trees** are a powerful tool for creating Artificial Intelligence in Unreal Engine 4. 

They're a combination of two asset types: The **Blackboard** and the **Behavior Tree**.

| Asset Type | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Blackboard** | The Blackboard is the AI's memory. It stores key values for the Behavior Tree to use. |
| **Behavior Tree** | The Behavior Tree is the AI's processor. It makes decisions, and then acts on those decisions. |

Below are links to the sections in the documentation covering the use of Behavior Trees. The [Quick Start Guide](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart) takes you through making an AI chase the Player. Then there's the [User Guide](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/UserGuide), which contains instructions on the most common tasks when using Behavior Trees. Next, the [Node Reference](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/NodeReference) contains a listing of all then nodes available in the Behavior Tree editor, what they do, and what their properties are. Finally, [How Unreal Engine 4 Behavior Trees Differ](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/HowUE4BehaviorTreesDiffer) is a paper written for those who are already familiar with how other Behavior Trees work.
