The NavMesh in Unreal has a number of functions that work well with Behavior Trees, and while it may not be necessary depending on the game you are making, it will help in a number of game types. Also, the Top Down template already includes a Nav Mesh Bounds Volume, but you may choose to start in a completely blank project at a later date.

## Steps

1. [REGION:raw]**Modes** panel > **Volumes** > **Volumes**.[/REGION]

1. Click and drag a **Nav Mesh Bounds Volume** into the map.

1. **Translate** and **Scale** the volume so it encapsulates the areas you want your characters to be able to navigate.

	* You can use more than one Volume if you like, or one large one that encapsulates the entire level.

1. While working in the Viewport, press the **P** key to see if your NavMesh is building.

	If you see a green mesh overlay on your floors, it is building correctly. When the mesh turns red, it means it is recalculating a section because you either moved the volume or the mesh inside of it.

	You can press the **P** key at any time to show or hide the NavMesh.
