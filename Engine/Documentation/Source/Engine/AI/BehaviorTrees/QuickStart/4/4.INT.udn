As we have created a project with a **Character** already in it, we have access to a humanoid **Skeletal Mesh** and its **Animation Blueprint**. We will use these in the tutorial, but feel free to use your own if you have them available.

This Character will become our new AI Character. The reason we use a Character, over say a Pawn, is to gain access to the Character Movement Component's functionality.

## Steps

1. **Double-click** the AI_Character Blueprint in the **Content Browser** to open it for editing.

1. Select the **Mesh** component in the **Components** panel.

1. In the **Details** panel, find the **Mesh** category and assign the SK_Mannequin (or your own) **Skeletal Mesh**.

1. Move the **Mesh** Component to center it up inside in the capsule.

1. Rotate the **Mesh** Component so it faces the direction the blue Arrow Component is pointing.

1. In the **Details** panel, find the **Animation** category and assign the ThirdPerson_AnimBP to the **Animation Blueprint Generated Class** property.

1. Select the **CapsuleComponent** from the **Components** panel, then in the **Details** panel, adjust the **Capsule Half Height** and **Capsule Radius** so they encompass the **Skeletal Mesh**.

1. Select the **Character Movement** Component.

1. In the **Details** panel, in the Movement Component category, adjust the _Agent Radius_ and _Agent Height_ values.

	_Set the Agent Radius to at least the Capsule's radius, and the Agent Height to at least twice the Capsule's "half height."_

1. With the Character Movement Component still selected, change the **Max Walk Speed** property, in the **Character Movement** category to `400`.
