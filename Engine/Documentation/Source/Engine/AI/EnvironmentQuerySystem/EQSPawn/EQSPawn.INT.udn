The **Environment Query System Testing Pawn** (**EQSTestingPawn**) is a specialized Pawn class that enables you to check out what your Environment Queries are actually doing. The exact makeup of your Environment Query will define the size and shape of what is created, but it will always be represented as colored spheres. Spheres that are on the color scale from green to red, indicate some level of match for the various tests your Environment Query ran. Blue spheres indicate a failure or a boolean type test that returned false, such as the **Trace** test.

## Creating an EQS Testing Pawn

[/REGION]

1. In the Content Browser, **Create** a new Blueprint
1. Expand **All Classes** and search for **EQSTestingPawn**
1. Select **EQSTestingPawn**
1. Name the new **EQSTestingPawn** Blueprint

## Using an EQS Testing Pawn

[REGION:lightbox]

[/REGION]

1. Place the EQSTestingPawn Blueprint into your level, by clicking and dragging it from the **Content Browser** to the **Viewport**.

	[REGION:note]
	Given the experimental nature of the Environment Query System, the EQSTestingPawn can be very processor intensive, and making changes to its active Query Template can cause your system to hang for extremely long times. It's best to clear the Query Template property while making edits to your Environment Query.

1. Assign an **Environment Query** to the **Query Template** property

## Feedback Reference

**Blue**: Test failed at that item, so the item is completely un-weighted and culled from the results. Usually occurs when a value is filtered out, such as using a Distance Test and filtering out any Item over (or under) a range. If you don't want a value to be culled completely, use the Clamp Features in the scoring section. 

**Green-Red**: Green is more desirable than Red. The number listed on these is the weight of the Item. If previewing only one Debug Step, this value will be the final value from the selected Test.

## EQS Testing Pawn Property Reference

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Query Template** | The Environment Query that the EQSTestingPawn should use. |
| **Query Params** | Enables you to pass named values into the Environment Query to quickly adjust its settings. |
| **Time Limit Per Step** | If this value is set to anything greater than 0.0, it will cause the EQSTestingPawn to stop calculating a step at the time this property is set to. Helps to mitigate making adjustments to the Environment Query while using the EQSTestingPawn. Note: This will not reduce the time it takes to calculate the locations for the **Generator**, such as using a large **Simple Grid** with a tight **Density** |
| **Step to Debug Draw** | Shows a single debug step. May not map to the order your steps appear in the Environment Query.  |
| **Draw Labels** | Enables drawing the weight or reason for failure on the debug spheres in the Viewport. |
| **Draw Failed Items** | Enables the culling of any failed tests, such as when a trace fails to find its target. |
| **Re Run Query Only on Finished Move** | Will only update the debug visualization in the Viewport when you stop moving the EQSTestingPawn. It's advised to keep this enabled unless you are working with a very quick Environment Query. |
| **Should be Visible in Game** | Makes the EQSTestingPawn, and its debug visualization, visible in the running game. |
| **Querying Mode** | [INCLUDE:#eqs1] |
