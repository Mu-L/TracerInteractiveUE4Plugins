While an Environment Query can generate a number of Items based on getting an Actor type, it doesn't do that for Contexts. So, we need a way to have the Player's Pawn as a Context, which is where the **EnvQueryContext_BlueprintBase** comes into play.


## Steps

1. Double click the **PlayerContext** Blueprint in the **Content Browser** to open it for editing.
1. Override the **ProvideActorsSet** Function:

	The **Override** button is hidden until you mouse over the **Functions** portion of the **My Blueprint** panel.

	This will override the default behavior of the function with the Blueprint Graph that opens:

1. Add a **Get All Actors Of Class** and connect it between the **Provide Actor Set** Node and the **ReturnNode** like this:

1. Finally set the **Actor Class** of the **Get All Actors Of Class** Node to **Top Down Character**, **Compile**, and **Save**.
