The **Environment Query System** is considered **Experimental**, meaning it can change drastically at any time, so you must opt in to it.

## Steps

* [REGION:raw] As of 4.7 the Environment Querying System is enabled by going to **Edit Menu** > **Editor Preferences** > **Experimental**, and checking the check box next to **Environment Querying System** under the AI category. [/REGION]

This will eventually not be necessary, so if you don't see this check box, then you don't need to do this step.
