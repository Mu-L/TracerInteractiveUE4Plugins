Since you already have all the assets necessary to fill out the tree, you're going to be building this Behavior Tree:

Before we get into the steps to create this [Behavior Tree](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/UserGuide), let's talk about what it does (or rather what it will do once we create the necessary EQS bits). 

* We enter the graph at the top Sequence Node, and then start executing it's children from left to right, and will keep executing as long as its children are successful.
* First is the EQS Query node that runs the FindPlayer template. We only allow this node to execute once every 0.5 seconds, and if it fails, the tree is locked out of executing the other nodes by the Cooldown Node returning failed, thusly failing its parent sequence node.
* But, if the EQS Query is successful (it finds the player), then the second EQS Query is allowed to execute, finding the AI a place to hide.
* Finally we move to the place that the second EQS Query found.

## Steps

1. Double-click the RunnerBT Blueprint in the Content Browser to open it for editing.

1. [REGION:raw]Add a **Sequence Node** (right-click in the Graph Area %arrow% **Composites** %arrow% **Sequence**)[/REGION]

1. Connect the **Root Node** to this new **Sequence Node**

1. [REGION:raw]Create a **Run EQS Query Node** (right-click in the Graph Area %arrow% **Tasks** %arrow% **Run EQSQuery**)[/REGION]

	![](addEqs1.png)

1. Connect it to the **Sequence Node**

	![](connectEqs1.png)

1. Select this **Run EQS Query Node**, and in the **Details** panel, set the **Query Template** to FindPlayer
1. While still in the Details panel set the **Blackboard Key** to ActorToFleeFrom

1. [REGION:raw]Add a **Cooldown Decorator** to the **Run EQS Query Node** (right-click the **Run EQS Query Node** %arrow% **Add Decorator...** %arrow% **Cooldown**)[/REGION]

	![](addCooldown.png)

1. Select the **Cooldown Decorator** and set its **Cool Down Time** to 0.5

	![](setCooldown.png)

1. [REGION:raw]Create another **Run EQS Query Node** (right-click in the Graph Area %arrow% **Tasks** %arrow% **Run EQSQuery**)[/REGION] and connect it to the **Sequence Node**
	
	![](addEqs2.png)

1. Select the second **Run EQS Query Node**, and in the **Details** panel, set the **Query Template** to FindHidingSpot

1. Again, while still in the Details panel, set the **Blackboard Key** to **FleeToLocation**

	![](setEqs2props.png)

1. Position it to the right of the first **Run EQS Query Node**
1. [REGION:raw]Create a **Move To Node** (right-click in the Graph Area %arrow% **Tasks** %arrow% **Move To**)[/REGION]

	![](addMoveTo.png)

1. Connect it to the **Sequence Node**

	![](connectMoveTo.png)

1. Select the Move To node and set **Blackboard Key** to FleeToLocation
1. While still in the Details Panel, set **Acceptable Radius** to 0.5

	![](setMoveTo.png)

1. Position it to the right of the second **Run EQS Query Node**

	![](finalBT_Setup.png)

With everything connected the Behavior Tree will is ready and no further edits to it will be necessary.
