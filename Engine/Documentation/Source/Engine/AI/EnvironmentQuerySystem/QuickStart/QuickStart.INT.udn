Crumbs:%ROOT%, Engine, Gameplay/AI, Engine/AI/EnvironmentQuerySystem
Description:This Quick Start Guide covers creating a Behavior Tree that uses multiple Run EQS Query nodes to find a place to hide from the player character.


This Quick Start will teach you the basics of using the **Environment Query System**. In it, you will use Environment Queries to find Actors and Locations, then, using a series of tests, you'll be given the best option. Then, using a Behavior tree, you'll have the AI flee from the Player Pawn (or Pawns) to a hiding spot.

This is a more advanced Quick Start and assumes you are familiar with [Blueprints](Engine/Blueprints/BP_HowTo/BasicUsage) and [Behavior Trees](Engine/AI/BehaviorTrees/QuickStart).
