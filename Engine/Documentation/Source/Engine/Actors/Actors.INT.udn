 At the most fundamental level, an [**Actor**](Gameplay/UnrealTerminology) is any gameplay Object that you can place, or [spawn/instantiate](Gameplay/HowTo/SpawnAndDestroyActors), in a level. Unreal Engine 4 handles the most commonly used cases automatically, like when you drag an Static Mesh from the **Content Browser** into a level, you will get a **Static Mesh Actor**.

[INCLUDE:Shared/Glossary/A#glossary_actor]

No matter the type of Actor you are using in your level - be it a light, a Static Mesh, a Particle System Emitter Actor, or anything else - you will need to know a few basics on how to create and manipulate them in your scenes.

This involves a few integral tasks: placing Actors, selecting Actors, positioning Actors, and modifying Actors. In 
other words, to create a level, Actors will be placed into a map, moved around to create an environment, and their 
properties will be modified to cause them to look or behave appropriately.
