**Static Meshes** are one of the foundational types of renderable geometry in Unreal Engine. In order to use these meshes 
to populate your worlds, the **StaticMeshActor** is used. StaticMeshes dragged into the level from the **Content Browser** are 
automatically converted to StaticMeshActors.

[REGION:note]
Though they are called StaticMeshActors, this simply refers to the mesh of the StaticMeshActor being static. A StaticMeshActor can be made movable so it can be an elevator or made to simulate physics so it can crush the player. 
See [Making a StaticMeshActor Movable](#makingastaticmeshactormovable) for details.

## Placement

StaticMeshActors are placed in maps using standard Actor placement methods; either through the **Right-click** context 
menu of the viewports or drag and drop from the [Content Browser](Engine/Content/Browser).

**Drag and Drop**

![](SMA_clickNDragCreate.png)

1. In the **Content Browser**, locate the StaticMesh you want to add to the map as a StaticMeshActor.

1. **Left-Click** on the StaticMesh in the **Content Browser** and drag the mouse (while holding the **Left Mouse Button** down) from the **Content Browser** to the location in the **Viewport** where you want to place the mesh. The location does not need to be exact. You can always reposition, rotate, scale the mesh afterwards.   

1. Release the **Left Mouse Button** to place the mesh in the map as a StaticMeshActor, as seen in the **Property** window.   




**Context Menu**

![](SMA_rightClickAdd.png)

1. In the **Content Browser**, select the StaticMesh you want to add to the map as a StaticMeshActor.
   
1. **Right-click** in the viewport where you want to add the mesh and choose **Place Actor: Selection** from the **Context Menu**. The location does not need to be exact. You can always reposition, rotate, scale the mesh afterwards. 

1. The StaticMesh has been placed in the map as a StaticMeshActor, as seen in the **Property** window. 
  
	

## Making a StaticMeshActor Movable

In order to move, rotate, or scale a StaticMeshActor during play, you must first make it **Movable** by selecting **Moveable** from the top of the **Details** panel under **Mobility** when the StaticMeshActor is selected.

## Material Override

The Material(s) applied to a StaticMesh can be overridden on a per-Actor basis. This allows a single StaticMesh 
asset to be used multiple times in a single map or throughout your game while giving each a unique appearance. 
The **Materials** property located in the **Rendering** category of the StaticMeshComponent of the StaticMeshActor 
is an array of Materials that directly maps to those applied to the StaticMesh asset through the [Static Mesh Editor](Engine/Content/Types/StaticMeshes/Editor). 
Materials can be assigned to the array manually or they can be applied directly to the mesh in the **Viewport** by 
dragging and dropping from the **Content Browser**.

**Manual Assignment**

![](SMA_MaterialSingle.png)

1. In the **Viewport**, select the StaticMeshActor you want to assign.

1. In the **Details** panel, under the **Materials** category, you will see all the materials assigned to the StaticMeshActor.

1. In the **Content Browser**, select the Material you want to apply to StaticMeshActor in the map, and either:   

1. Press the ![](button_assign_left_16x.png) button for the corresponding item in the **Materials** array to assign the material. The mesh is now displayed with the Material applied.
	
	**OR**

1. **Left-click** and drag the material from the **Content Browser** to the desired material slot on the StaticMeshActor's details.

**Drag and Drop**

[/REGION]

1. In the **Content Browser**, locate the Material you want to apply to StaticMeshActor in the map.

1. **Left-click** on the Material in the **Content Browser** and drag the mouse (while holding the **Left Mouse Button** down) from the **Content Browser** to the section of the StaticMeshActor in the viewport you want to apply the Material to.   

1. Release the **Left Mouse Button** to apply the Material. The mesh is now displayed with the Material applied and the **Materials** array in the Property Window has been updated.   

	This will replace all materials on the StaticMeshActor.



## Collision

By default, if a StaticMesh has Physics Bodies, either generated in your desired 3D authoring package 
(see: [FBX Pipeline: StaticMeshes](Engine/Content/FBX/StaticMeshes#Collision)) or in the StaticMesh Editor 
(see: [](Engine/Physics/Collision/Reference)), it will have collision and it will be set to **Block All**. See the 
[](Engine/Physics/Collision) documentation for more information on Collision Channels and adjusting Collision settings.
