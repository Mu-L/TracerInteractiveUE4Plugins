When creating a new Animation Blueprint, you will be asked to pick a valid [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) for it to target.

1. Either **Right-click** in an empty space in the **Content Browser** or click the **Add New** button.

	You are also given the ability to select a [Parent Class](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/ClassBlueprint) for the Animation Blueprint to use. 
	Most of the time you will not need to select one and can use the default class. However, based on your circumstances, you can choose one if you need to. 

1. The new asset will automatically be created in the **Content Browser**.

## Context Menu Creation of an Animation Blueprint

You can also create an Animation Blueprint that targets a specific [Skeletal Mesh](Engine/Content/Types/SkeletalMeshes) or Skeleton by **Right-clicking** on it in the **Content Browser**. 

1. **Right-click** on the Skeletal Mesh (or Skeleton Asset) you want the Animation Blueprint to target and click **Create** > **Anim Assets** > **Anim Blueprint**.

1. The Animation Blueprint is created in the same folder as the target Skeletal Mesh asset, with the name ready to be edited.
