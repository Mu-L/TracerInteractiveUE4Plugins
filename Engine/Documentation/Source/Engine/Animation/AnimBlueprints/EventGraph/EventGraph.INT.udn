[EXCERPT:Intro]
Every Animation Blueprint has a single **EventGraph**, which is a standard [Graph](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/GraphEditor) 
that uses a collection of special animation-related events to initiate sequences of nodes. The most common use of the EventGraph 
is to update values used by [Blend Spaces](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) and other blend nodes to drive animations within the AnimGraph.

As an example use case, the EventGraph of an Animation Blueprint could use the velocity of the owning Pawn to determine direction and speed. These values can then be used as inputs in a Blend Space within the AnimGraph to blend between an idle animation and various directional movement animations. 
Similarly, the pitch and yaw of the owning Pawn can be used as inputs in another Blend Space to blend between various aiming poses applied additively in order to cause the mesh to aim where it is looking while still maintaining the previously mentioned movement animations.

## Animation Events

Various events are called by the animation system to initialize and update the Animation Blueprint. These can be placed in the EventGraph to implement or override functionality.
