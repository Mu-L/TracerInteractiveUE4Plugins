In this step, we set up our AnimGraph to handle the blending of our AnimMontage and the movement pose from our State Machine. 

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack**, open the **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint** Animation Blueprint. 

1.	Inside the **MyBlueprint** window, open the **AnimGraph**.

1.	Drag off the **Locomotion** State Machine and search for and add **New Save cached pose**.

	Here we are getting the resulting pose from our Locomotion State Machine and storing it in a cached pose that we can use elsewhere. 

1.	Give the cached pose a name by pressing **F2** on the node such as **LocomotionCache**.

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add the **Use cached pose 'LocomotionCache'** (or whatever you named the cached pose).

1.	Drag off the **Use cached pose** node and search for and add the **Layered blend per bone** node.

	The **Layered Blend Per Bone** node will allow us to blend animations together from a specified bone on the Skeleton.

1.	Copy/Paste the **Use cached pose 'LocomotionCache'** node, then drag off it and add the **Slot 'DefaultSlot'** node.

1.	In the **Settings** for the **Slot** node, click the dropdown menu and select **DefaultGroup.UpperBody**.

	When an Animation Montage that uses this slot is called to play, it will now be called inside our AnimGraph. 

1.	Connect the **Slot** to the **Blend Poses 0** pin on the **Layered blend per bone** node, then connect the out to the **Result** and **Compile**.

Our AnimGraph is complete, but we still need to modify some settings on the **Layered blend per bone** node to finish up which we will do next.
