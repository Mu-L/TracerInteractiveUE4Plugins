In this final step, we define the method in which to layer our blended animation and which bone to start the blend from. 

1.	Inside the **AnimGraph** of **UE4ASP_HeroTPP_AnimBlueprint**, click on the **Layered blend per bone** node, then expand the **Layer Setup** section and click the **+** sign.

1.	Under **Bone Name** enter **spine_01**, then set **Blend Depth** to **1** and check **Mesh Space Rotation Blend**.

	With these settings, we can blend the shooting AnimMontage onto our Skeleton starting from the **spine_01** bone. 

1.	Inside the **MyBlueprint** window, open the **EventGraph**.

1.	Drag off the **As Ue4ASP Character** pin of the **Cast To Ue4ASP_Character** node and add the **Get Fire Button Down** node. 

	![](Animations19.png)

	This will tell us if the player is pressing the fire button or not. 

1.	Hold **B** and **Left-click** in the graph to create a **Branch** node and connect it following **Set Crouching**.

	For the **Condition**, plug in the **FireButtonDown** pin. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add the **Montage Is Playing** node and assign **Fire_Shotgun_Ironsights_Montage**.

1.	Off the **Return Value** of the **Montage Is Playing** node, add a **Branch**. 

1.	Connect the **Branch** from Step 5 to the new **Branch** as shown below and add a **Montage Play** node with **Montage to Play** set to your Montage. 

	![](Animations23.png)

	This will check now if the Montage is currently playing and if it is, do not play it (and if it is not, play the Montage). 

1.	**Compile** and **Save**, close the **Blueprint** and delete the existing **ThirdPersonCharacter** in the level.

	This will allow us to use our selected character defined in our Game Mode and not the one placed in the level. 

1. **Play** in the editor.

You will see that when you hold the **Left Mouse Button** down, the character will play the shooting AnimMontage. 
You can walk around while shooting, you can even crouch (by holding **C**) and shoot as well. 
You could use this same guide to play a melee attack, reload animation or any other animation that you want to be able to do while moving around. 

The **UpperBody** slot that we created and assigned in our Animation Montage can be assigned in other Animation Montages as well. 
Since our AnimGraph has the Slot node assigned, whenever we call to play an Animation Montage that has that slot assigned, it will get played with our defined settings.
