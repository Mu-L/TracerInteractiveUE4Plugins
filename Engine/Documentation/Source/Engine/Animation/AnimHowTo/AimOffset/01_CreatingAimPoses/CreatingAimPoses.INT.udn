In this step, we update our default playable character and create all the poses that will be needed for the Aim Offset. 

[INCLUDE:Engine/Animation/AnimHowTo/AdditiveAnimations/01_BlendSetup#intro]

## Steps

1.  In the **Content Browser** under the **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints** folder, open the **ThirdPersonGameMode**.

1.	Under **Default Pawn Class**, click the drop-down menu and select the **Ue4ASP_Character** then **Save** and close the Blueprint.

	We are changing the default playable character to use the one provided with the Animation Starter Pack. 

1.	In the **Content Browser** open the **Content/AnimStarterPack** folder, then click **Add New** and create a folder called **AimPoses**.  

	![](AimOffset1.png)

1.	Drag the **Aim_Space_Hip** asset onto the **AimPoses** folder and select **Copy**. 

	![](AimOffset2.png)

	This is the animation sequence that contains a range of motions for aiming a weapon that we will chop up into poses. 

1.	Inside the **AimPoses** folder, with **Aim_Space_Hip** selected, press **Ctrl+W** to duplicate it and name it **Aim_Center**. 

	![](AimOffset3.png)

1.	Open the **Aim_Center** asset, click the **Pause** button from the playback controls, then click the **ToFront** button. 

	![](AimOffset4.png)

1.	**Right-click** on the scrub bar in the timeline, then choose the **Remove from frame 1 to frame 87** option. 

	![](AimOffset5.png)

	With this, we now have a single frame containing a pose we can use in our Aim Offset. 

1.	In the **AimPoses** folder with **Aim_Space_Hip** selected, press **Ctrl+W** to duplicate it and name it **Aim_Center_Down**.  

1.	Open **Aim_Center_Down**, make sure it is on frame **0**, then click the **ToNext** button and go to frame **20**. 

	![](AimOffset9.png)

	The character will now be aiming downward in the viewport, which is the pose we want to use for aiming down. 

1.	**Right-click** on the scrub bar in the timeline, then choose the **Remove frame 0 to frame 20** option. 

	![](AimOffset10.png)

	Depending on where you **Right-click** on the scrub bar, the frame range may be off by a frame or two, just make sure the character is aiming down. 
	
1.	**Right-click** on the scrub bar in the timeline again, then choose the **Remove from frame 1 to frame 68** option. 

	![](AimOffset11.png)

1.	In the **AimPoses** folder with **Aim_Space_Hip** selected, press **Ctrl+W** to duplicate it and name it **Aim_Center_Up**.  

1.	Open **Aim_Center_Up**, make sure it is on frame **0**, then click the **ToNext** button and go to frame **10**. 

1.	**Right-click** on the scrub bar in the timeline, then choose the **Remove frame 0 to frame 10** option. 

	![](AimOffset14.png)

1.	**Right-click** on the scrub bar in the timeline again, then choose the **Remove from frame 1 to frame 78** option. 

	![](AimOffset15.png)

1.	**Duplicate** the **Aim_Space_Hip** asset each time and create each of the remaining poses based on the table below.
	
	| Anim Name | Start At Keyframe | Remove Frames 1 | Remove Frames 2 |
	| ------- | ------ | ------ | ------ |
	| **Aim_Left_Center** | 30 | 0 - 30 | 1 - 57 |
	| **Aim_Left_Up** | 40 | 0 - 40 | 1 - 48 |
	| **Aim_Left_Down** | 50 | 0 - 50 | 1 - 37 |
	| **Aim_Right_Center** | 60 | 0 - 60 | 1 - 27 |
	| **Aim_Right_Up** | 70 | 0 - 70 | 1 - 17 |
	| **Aim_Right_Down** | 80 | 0 - 80 | 1 - 8 |

	For each animation, be sure to start at the suggested **Start At Keyframe** frame, then **Right-click** on the scrub bar and **Remove Frames 1**, **Right-click** on the scrub bar again and **Remove Frames 2**. Each of your animations should be a single frame with the character aiming in the direction of its corresponding name. 
	When you have created each, your **AimPoses** folder should have several poses in it for each aiming direction.

1.	In the **Content Browser**, **Shift** and select each of the aim poses. 

	![](AimOffset18.png)

1.	**Right-click** and under **Asset Actions**, select the **Bulk Edit via Property Matrix** option. 

	![](AimOffset19.png)

1.	In the **Property Matrix**, under **Additive Settings**, change the **Additive Anim Type** to **Mesh Space**. 

	![](AimOffset20.png)

	[REGION:note]
	For an animation to be compatible with an Aim Offset, it must be set to use an Additive Anim Type of **Mesh Space**. 
	[/REGION:note]

1.	Change the **Base Pose Type** to **Selected animation frame**, then under **Base Pose Animation**, click the pick asset icon and choose **Idle_Rifle_Hip**. 

	![](add_01.png)

	This Base Pose Type will define how the additive delta is to be calculated. 

1.	Once you have done so, return to the **Content Browser** and click the **Save All** button.

With each of our pose assets created, in the next step, we will the poses to create our Aim Offset.
