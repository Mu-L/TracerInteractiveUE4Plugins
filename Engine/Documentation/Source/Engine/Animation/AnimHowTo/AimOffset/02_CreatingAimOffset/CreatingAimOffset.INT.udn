In this step, we take each of our aim poses and create our Aim Offset which will blend between each of the poses. 

## Steps

1.	In the **Content/AnimStarterPack/UE4_Mannequin/Mesh** folder, **Right-click** on the **UE4_Mannequin** and select **Create Aim Offset**.

	This will create the Aim Offset asset based on this Skeleton. 

1.	In the Aim Offset window (center window), under **Parameters**, enter the parameters shown below.

	Set the **X Axis Label** to **Yaw** and **Y Axis Label** to **Pitch**, then set both Axis Ranges to **-90 to 90** and click **Apply Parameter Changes**. 

	[REGION:note]
	Aim Offsets work very similar to [Blend Spaces](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) and will allow us to blend between our poses based on our parameters.

	You can preview the blending of poses by moving your mouse within the grid, the viewport mesh will update its pose based on your mouse position. 
	
The Aim Offset is now setup, in the next step we will hook it up for use within our **Animation Blueprint** so that gameplay can drive the blending.
