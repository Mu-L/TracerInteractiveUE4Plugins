[REGION:warning]
The Pose Driver node inside the AnimGraph in Animation Blueprints is currently experimental and some features may not work as expected.
[/REGION]

[TOC (start:2 end:2)]

In addition to using the [](Engine\Animation\AnimPose\PoseBlenderNode) to playback **Pose Assets** through [Animation Blueprints](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints), 
you can also drive Pose Assets directly at runtime with the **Pose Driver** node available within the [AnimGraph](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints/AnimGraph) of an Animation Blueprint. 
The Pose Driver node enables a bone to drive other aspects of animation, based on a set of 'example poses' or lets you drive a curve value based on a bone's movement. 
One use for this node would be to create a pose space deformer to drive corrective blend shapes based on a bone's orientation or translation. 

In the clip below, clavicle bone poses are being used to move the shoulder relative to the arm bone's movement.

We add the Pose Driver node and assign a Pose Asset containing our poses that we want to control. 
We then set the **Source Bone** to our **clav** bone so that based on the **Drive Source** (which is set to **Rotate**), 
we can update our **Pose Targets** that drive the pose being used.
As the animation plays and the clav bone rotates, in the **Pose Targets** section each pose displays a bar to indicate the amount of influence it has to the final pose. 
[REGION:note]
The Pose Driver node uses **RBF (Radial Basis Function)** which interpolates driven values based on the orientation of a target bone.
[/REGION]

## Adding a Pose Driver

To add a Pose Driver node to your **Animation Blueprint**: 

1. On the **AnimGraph**, right-click in the graph and search for the **Pose Driver** node. 

	![](ContextPoseDriverNode.png)

1. Once the node has been added, supply the incoming **Source Pose** and the wire the **Out Pose** to the **Final Animation Pose** or other nodes for blending. 

	![](CompletePoseDriver.png)

1. Use the **Details** panel to define what bones should be evaluated and Pose Asset poses or Curves should be driven. 

	![](BlankDetails.png)

	
## Pose Targets

Pose Targets are where you specify the Poses from a Pose Asset or Curves you want to drive with the Pose Driver node. 

With a Pose Asset assigned, you can click the **Tools** button and select **Copy All from PoseAsset** to add each of the poses to the Pose Target window.

Once they have been added, the window will update with the corresponding poses.

[REGION:tip]
You can select each pose by clicking on it in the **Pose Target** window or by clicking on the target line in the viewport. 
[/REGION]

### Curve based Pose Targets

Pose Targets can also be driven by [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves) (Morph Targets and Material Curves) instead of using a Pose Asset. 

To use curve data instead of a Pose Asset: 

1.	In the **Details** panel of a **Pose Driver** node, under the **Pose Driver** section, change the **Drive Output** to **Drive Curves**. 

	![](DriveOutputSetting.png)

1.	**Compile** the **Animation Blueprint**. 

	![](CompileButton.png)

1.	Click the **Add Target** button to add the number of curves you want to drive.

	![](AddTarget.png)

1.	For each curve, under the **Drive** option select your desired curve and check the **Curve** checkbox, then define its value in the graph.

## Pose Driver Properties

The **Pose Driver** properties section of the **Details** panel enables you to define the **Source Bones** to use for driving parameters in the **Pose Targets**. 
You can specify multiple Source Bones or **Only Drive Selected Bones**, define an **Eval Space Bone** to use when reading the Source Bone Transform, set **RBF Parameters** used by the RBF Solver, as well as set the **Drive Source** and **Drive Output**. 

Below are the properties within the Pose Driver section: 

| Option | Description |
| --- |--- |
| **Source Bones** | Bone to use for driving parameters based on its orientation. | 
| **Only Drive Selected Bones** |  If we should filter bones to be driven using the **Only Drive Bones** array. | 
| **Only Drive Bones** | Only the bones specified in the array will be modified by the Pose Driver node. | 
| **Eval Space Bone** | Optional other bone space to use when reading Source Bone transform. If not specified, the local space of Source Bone (for example, relative to the parent bone) is used.| 
| **RBFParams** | [INCLUDE:Engine\Animation\AnimPose\PoseDriverNode#rbftable] | 
| **Drive Source** | Which part of the transform is read: **Rotation** or **Translation**. | 
| **Drive Output** | Whether we should drive poses or curves. | 

[COMMENT:none]

[EXCERPT:rbftable]
| Option | Description |
| ----------- |------|
| **Radius** | Default radius for each target, scaled by per-Target Scale Factor. | 
| **Function** | Defines the type of [Blend Mode](Engine/Animation/NonLinearBlends) to use. | 
| **Distance Method** | Sets the measurement of distance to: **Swing Angle**, **Quaternion** or **Euclidean**. | 
| **Twist Axis** | Axis to use when **Distance Method** is set to **Swing Angle**. | 
| **Weight Threshold** | Weight below which we shouldn't bother returning a contribution from a target. | 
[/EXCERPT:rbftable]

[/COMMENT]


## Settings and Relevancy

The **Settings** section of the **Details** panel enables you to define the **Pose Asset** to evaluate and define if [](Engine/Animation/SyncGroups) are used. 
The **Relevancy** section provides a way for you to determine if relevant animation nodes should ignore the node. 

| Option | Description |
| --- |--- |
| **Pose Source** | The **Pose Asset** used as the source of pose data. | 
| **Sync Group Name** | The name of the Synch Group to reference. | 
| **Sync Group Role** | The type of membership in the group. | 
| **Ignore for Relevancy Test** | If true, "Relevant anim" nodes that look for the highest weighted animation in a state will ignore this node.  | 


## Additional Examples and Resources

Below are some additional examples of the Pose Driver node and settings. 

Below, the clavicle, lower, and upper arm bones are driving corrective blend shapes deforming the area around the shoulder as it rotates through curves.
