[EXCERPT:Intro]
Blend Spaces are used by placing nodes in the **AnimGraphs** of [Animation Blueprints](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) which take in value data to drive the blending of animations and the final animation pose.

[REGION:note]
For a full walk-through of setting up a Blend Space for locomotion blending, see the [](Engine\Animation\AnimHowTo\BlendSpace) how-to page.

## Adding Blend Space Nodes

Blend Space nodes provide access to the sample parameter data and output pose of the Blend Space.
 
**To place a Blend Space node using drag-and-drop:**

1. In the [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints/AnimGraph) of an **Animation Blueprint**, find the Blend Space you want to sample in the **Asset Browser**.

1. Left-click on it and drag the mouse into the **AnimGraph**.

1. Release the **Left Mouse Button** to place the **Blend Space** node in the graph.

**To place a Blend Space node using the context menu:**

1. Right-click in the **AnimGraph** and expand **Blend Spaces** and select the **Blend Space** you want to sample.

1. The **Blend Space** node is placed in the graph.

## Sampling Parameters

Blend Spaces rely on data being passed into the sample parameters in order to perform the animation blending. 
Each Blend Space node has input data pins for each sample parameter that is created during the [](Engine\Animation\Blendspaces\Editor) process.
Variables or outputs from other nodes can be wired to these pins to pass the necessary data to the Blend Space and drive the blending of your Sample Poses.

The values passed to the Blend Space are generally variables calculated during the update cycle in the **EventGraph** or through gameplay code.

## Output Pose

The **Pose** output pin of the Blend Space node can be wired to the **Pose** input pin of the **Result** node in the **AnimGraph** in the simplest case.

Or, it can be wired to any other input pin that accepts an animation pose as an input when a more complex animation chain is necessary.
