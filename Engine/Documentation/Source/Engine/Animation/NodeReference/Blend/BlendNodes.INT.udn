[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Blend Nodes** are used to blend multiple animations together. These nodes are only available to be placed in the **Anim Graph** of a Animation Blueprint. Each blend node takes in multiple poses and an alpha or weight value that is used to calculate the weighting for each pose in the final output. Some blend nodes may be more complex than others and require additional data to be input as well.

## Apply Additive and Apply Mesh Space Additive

The **Apply Additive** adn **Apply Mesh Space Additive** nodes add an additive pose to a base normal animation pose based on an alpha value.

![](ApplyAdditive.png)

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Base** | The normal pose to use as the base. |
| **Additive** | The additive pose to be blended on top. |
| **Alpha** | A float value in the range [0.0, 1.0] to use as the alpha value to determine how much influence the additive pose imparts. A value of 0.0 means the **Additive** pose is not added to the **Base** input pose at all, while a value of **1.0** means the **Additive** pose is added fully to the **Base** input pose. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Pose** | The final pose after the blending has been applied. |

**Apply Additive** nodes are also affected by the **LOD Threshold** system introduced in 4.11, you can find the setting for this in the Details Panel for the **Apply Additive** node.

## Blend

The standard **Blend** node is a straight mixing of the two input poses based on an alpha input.

![](Blend.png)

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **A** | The first pose to be blended. |
| **B** | The second pose to be blended. |
| **Alpha** | A float value in the range [0.0, 1.0] to use as the alpha value to determine the weighting of the two poses. A value of 0.0 gives full weighting to the A input pose, while a value of 1.0 gives full weighting to the B input pose. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Pose** | The final pose after the blending has been applied. |


## Blend Poses by bool

The **Blend Poses by bool** node performs a time-based blend between two poses using a Boolean value as the key. When the Boolean reads true, the pose connected to the true input pin is used; when the Boolean is false, the false pose is used. Each pose has a float value Blend Time that is used to control how long it will take to blend into the pose.

![](BlendPosesByBool.png)

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Active Value** | This is the input Boolean that decides which of the two poses to use. |
| **True Pose** | Takes in a pose that will blend when the Boolean is set to true. |
| **False Pose** | Takes in a pose that will blend when the Boolean is set to false. |
| **True Blend Time** | Defines the amount of time needed to blend into the true pose. |
| **False Blend Time** | Defines the amount of time needed to blend into the false pose. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Pose** | The final pose after the blending has been applied. |

## Blend Poses by int

The **Blend Poses by int** node performs a time-based blend between any number of poses using an integer value as the key. For each input integer value, the pose associated with that value's input pin is used. For instance, when the integer is set to 0, the pose connected to Blend Pose 0 is used. Each pose has a float value Blend Time that is used to control how long it will take to blend into the pose.

To create additional Blend Pose inputs, simply **Right-click** on the node and choose **Add Blend Pin** from the context menu.

Inputs can be removed by **Right-clicking** on the desired input and choosing **Remove Blend Pin**.


| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Active Child Index** | This is the input int that decides which of the poses to use. |
| **Blend Pose X** | Takes in a pose that will blend when the Active Child Index is set to X. |
| **Blend Time X** | Defines the amount of time needed to blend into the X pose. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Pose** | The final pose after the blending has been applied. |



## Layered blend per bone

The **Layered blend per bone** node performs a masked blend that only affects a specific subset of the bones in the Skeleton. For instance, if you wanted to apply an animation to a character only from the waist up, this could be done using **Blend Per Bone**.

![Blend Nodes - Blend Per Bone](CE_nodes_blend_per_bone.png)

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **BasePose** | The first pose to be blended. |
| **BlendPose** | The second pose to be blended. |
| **BlendWeight** | A float value in the range [0.0, 1.0] to use as the alpha value to determine how much influence the additive pose imparts. A value of 0.0 means the **Additive** pose is not added to the **Base** input pose at all, while a value of 1.0 means the **Additive** pose is added fully to the **Base** input pose. |
| **Add Pin** | Creates another Blend Pose and Blend Weight input. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **OutPose** | The final pose after the blending has been applied. |



## Slot

The **Slot** node plays the resultant animation from a given animation slot. 



For more details on using Slots with the Animation Montage system, please see [](Engine/Animation/AnimMontage).

## Two-Way Additive Blend

The **Two-way Additive Blend** is virtually identical to the **Two-way Blend** described above, only it operates on and outputs additive poses.

![Blend Nodes - Two-way Additive Blend](CE_nodes_blend_twoway_additive.png)

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| A | The first additive pose to be blended. |
| B | The second additive pose to be blended. |
| Alpha | A `float` value in the range **[0.0, 1.0]** to use as the alpha value to determine the weighting of the two poses. A value of **0.0** gives full weighting to the **A** input pose, while a value of **1.0** gives full weighting to the **B** input pose. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| Pose | The final additive pose after the blending has been applied. |
