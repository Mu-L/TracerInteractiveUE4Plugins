## Blueprint Update Animation

[EXCERPT:Update]
The **Blueprint Update Animation** event is executed every frame allowing the Animation Blueprint to perform calculations and updates to any values it needs. This event is the entry point into the update loop of the EventGraph. The amount of time elapsed since the last update is available from the **DeltaTimeX** pin so time-dependent interpolations or incremental updates can be performed.
