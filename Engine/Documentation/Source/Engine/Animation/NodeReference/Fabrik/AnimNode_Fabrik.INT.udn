[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematics** (or **FABRIK**) is an IK solver that works on a chain of bones of arbitrary length (a minimum of 2 links). 
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

You can use FABRIK, by first adding the **FABRIK** node to the **AnimGraph** of your Animation Blueprint (pictured above). 

Once added, in addition to the **Component Pose**, the node takes in an **Effector Transform** which can be an absolute Transform or a relative one (based on another bone from the same Skeleton); the settings for the **End Effector** are also very similar to the **TwoBone_IK** node. 

In order to determine the current strength of the Skeletal Control applied, the **FABRIK** node takes in a float **Alpha** which can be set on the node itself or set through a float variable. 

Inside the **Details** panel for the **FABRIK** node you will find additional settings which can be used to further adjust how the solver functions:

In the **End Effector** section, you determine the target location and rotation. 

| Property | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| **Location, Rotation, Scale**| Coordinates for target location of tip bone - if EffectorLocationSpace is bone, this is the offset from Target Bone to use as target location (can also be set as a Pin on the node). |
| **Effector Transform Space**| Set the position of the bone in SkeletalMeshComponent's reference frame. |
| **Effector Transform Bone**| If Effector Transform Space is bone, this is the bone to use. |
| **Effector Rotation Source**| Control the Rotation (maintain component space, local space or match end effector target rotation). |

In the **Solver** section, you define the chain of bones to use, from the **Root** to the **Tip**. The Tip will try to reach the end effector location.

| Property | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| **Tip Bone**| Set the Tip Bone (choose from available bones). |
| **Root Bone**| Set the Root Bone (choose from available bones). |
| **Precision**| Tolerance for final tip location delta from EffectorLocation. The lower, the more precise it gets to the **End Effector** target, but the more expensive. |
| **Max Iterations**| Maximum number of iterations allowed, to control performance and make sure edge cases will not take frame rate down. |
| **Enable Debug Draw**| Toggle drawing of axes to debug joint rotation. |

In the **Settings** section, you set the strength applied. 

| Property | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| **Alpha**| Current strength of the Skeletal Control (can also be set as a Pin on the node). |
| **Alpha Scale Bias**| Set the Minimal and Maximal input scale values. |
| **Node**| Can be used to reset the Effector Rotation Source if it is set to something other than Local Rotation Relative to Parent. |
