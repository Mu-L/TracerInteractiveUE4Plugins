Crumbs: %ROOT%, Engine, Engine/Animation, Engine/Animation/NodeReference, Engine/Animation/NodeReference/SkeletalControls
Description:Describes how Apply a Percentage of Rotation drives the Rotation of a target bone with a specified percentage of the Rotation of another bone within the Skeleton.
version: 4.12

The **Apply a Percentage of Rotation** control drives the Rotation of a target bone at some specified percentage 
of the Rotation of another bone within the Skeleton.

Below an example of the **Apply a Percentage of Rotation** is used to drive the bones on a character to simulate movement.

Above, our character has two sets of packs, each of which have their own bones. 
The packs on the character's right side are not being affected by any Skeletal Controls while the packs on the character's left are using the **Apply a Percentage of Rotation** node. 

Using this node we give the impression that the packs are moving along with the character's movement. 
By changing the **Rotation Axis to Refer** value we can alter which way the packs rotate, while the **Multiplier** setting determines how much movement to apply. 

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Multiplier**[/REGION] ||
| **Target Bone** | Name of target bone to control. This is the main bone chain to modify from. |
| **Source Bone** | Name of the source bone to get Transform from. |
| **Rotation Axis To Refer** | The axis (X, Y, or Z) to control the Rotation for. |

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Multiplier** | A float value that represents the percentage of the source bone's Rotation to apply to the target bone. When **Multiplier** is 0, none of the source bone's Rotation is applied to the target bone, and when it is 1.0, all of the source bone's Rotation is applied. |

**Apply a Percentage of Rotation** nodes are also affected by the **LOD Threshold** system introduced in 4.11. You can find the setting for this in the **Details Panel** for the **Apply a Percentage of Rotation** node.
