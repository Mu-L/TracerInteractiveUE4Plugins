Scale - from one bone to another.

Below, we use the [](Engine\Animation\NodeReference\SkeletalControls\ApplyPercentRotation) node to drive one of the small packs on the character's left side. 
We then use the **Copy Bone** node to take the rotation from that pack and add apply it to the second pack so both packs rotate and move in the same manner. 
The packs on the character's left side have no Skeletal Controls applied to them, which is why they appear static and do not generate movement like the packs on the character's left.

The **Copy Bone** Skeletal Control takes the specified Transform from one bone and copies it to another bone. 
Be cautious when selecting the checkboxes for Transform. For instance, if you enable copying Location, the Target Bone will move to the Location of the specified Source Bone.
