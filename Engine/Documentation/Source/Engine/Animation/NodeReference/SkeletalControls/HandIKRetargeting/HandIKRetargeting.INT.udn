Description:Describes the Hand IK Retargeting control which can be used to handle retargeting of IK bones. 
version: 4.12
topic-image:handIKretargeting.png



The **Hand IK Retargeting** control is a solver that can be used to handle retargeting of IK bone chains. The solver moves an IK bone chain to meet FK hand bones, based on the **Hand FKWeight** value (to favor either side). 
For example, 0 would favor the left hand, 1 would favor the right hand and 0.5 would be equal weight.

Below, **Hand IK Retargeting** and [](Engine\Animation\NodeReference\SkeletalControls\TwoBoneIK\) controls are used to affect how a character holds a weapon.

While the Two Bone IK nodes drive the position of the left and right hands, the **Hand FKWeight** property (driven by the variable **Hand Favoring**) determines which hand to favor while holding the weapon. 
Above, we slowed the animation down to illustrate how the weapon shifts in the character's hands based on the weight value provided.
