The **Modify Curve** control can be used to expose [Animation Curve](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves) data which can be modified using arbitrary logic to enable dynamically-driven animations.

Below, the Modify Curve node is used to drive a curve we created called **Eye Glow Intensity** where the bear's eyes pulsate and glow over time.

**To add this node to the [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints/AnimGraph) of your [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints):**

1. Right-click in the **AnimGraph** and search for and add the **Modify Curve** node

1. Once added, right-click on the node and select **Add Curve Pin** and any associated curves you wish to modify.

With the exposed float pin, you can define any logic you wish to drive the value (the logic below uses the **Sin** of **Time** multiplied by a coeffiect value to drive the **Eye Glow Intensity** property).

**To remove pins from the Modify Curve node:**

* Right-click on the node again and select **Remove Curve Pin** or right-click on the pin itself and select **Remove This Curve Pin**.
