The **Rigid Body** Skeletal Control node (pictured below) can be used for light-weight physics simulation on characters using the high-performance [Immediate Mode PhysX API.](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/physx)
The Rigid Body node can be added to the **AnimGraph** of your [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) and can even be used with any [](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend) enabling you to switch from a pose into a simulated physics state.
Characters using this simulation can also generate collision with static geometry in the world.

A typical use case for the Rigid Body node is on characters that have ponytails, chains, or other bones that "dangle" that you want to apply physics to.

## Setup

Before using this node, inside your [Physics Asset](Engine/Physics/PhAT) select and set the [](Engine/Physics/PhysicsBodies) you want to simulate to **Simulated**.

Above, we have set each of the bones associated with the hoses that come from the character's head to simulate physics. 
[/REGION]

With your **Physics Asset** set up, inside the **AnimGraph** of your **Animation Blueprint**, add the **Rigid Body** node and the necessary logic to define when to use it.

With the Rigid Body node selected in your AnimGraph, you can change properties that define how the node is used inside the **Details** panel.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Override Physics Asset** | Physics asset to use. If empty, the Skeletal Mesh's default Physics Asset will be used. |
| **Override World Gravity** | Enables specification of a vector value to override gravity for this body. |
| **External Force** | Applies a uniform external force in world space. For example, this allows for easily faking inertia of movement while still simulating in component space. |
| **Overlap Channel** | The channel used to find static geometry to collide with. |
| **Component Space Simulation** | When true, simulation is done in component space. This means velocity is only inherited by animated bodies.|
| **Cached Bounds Scale** | Scale of cached bounds (versus actual bounds). Increasing this may improve performance, but overlaps may not work as well. A value of 1.0 effectively disables cached bounds. |
| **(As Pin) Alpha** | Shows the Alpha property as a pin on the node or in the Details panel. |
| **Alpha Scale Bias** | Set the Minimal and Maximal Influence values for the Alpha property. |
