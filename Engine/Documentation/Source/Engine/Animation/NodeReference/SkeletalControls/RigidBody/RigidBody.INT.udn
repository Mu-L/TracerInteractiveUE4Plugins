The **Rigid Body** Skeletal Control node (pictured below) can be used for light-weight physics simulation on characters using the high-performance [Immediate Mode PhysX API.](https://www.geforce.com/hardware/technology/physx)
The Rigid Body node can be added to the **AnimGraph** of your [](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) and can even be used with any [](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend) enabling you to switch from a pose into a simulated physics state.
Characters using this simulation can also generate collision with static geometry in the world.

A typical use case for the **Rigid Body** node is on characters that have ponytails, chains, or other bones that "dangle" that you want to apply physics to.

## Input and Output Pins

The table below outlines the available input and output pins along with a definition of the pins usage. 

![](RigidBodyPins.png)

| Pin | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **External Force** | Applies a uniform external force in World Space. For example, this allows for easily faking inertia of movement while still simulating in component space. |
| **Component Pose** | Takes in a Pose in Component Space and Outputs a Pose in Component Space. |
| **Alpha** | Current strength of the Skeletal Controls.|

## Example RigidBody Node Setup

Before using this node, inside your [Physics Asset](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor) select and set the [](Engine/Physics/PhysicsBodies) you want to simulate to **Simulated**.

Above, we have set each of the bones associated with the hoses that come from the character's head to simulate physics.

With your **Physics Asset** set up, inside the **AnimGraph** of your **Animation Blueprint**, add the **Rigid Body** node and the necessary logic to define when to use it.

Above, we are taking in data from another Animation Blueprint and feeding it through the **Rigid Body** node before ending in our Final Animation Pose.

With the Rigid Body node selected in your AnimGraph, you can change properties that define how the node is used inside the **Details** panel.

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Override Physics Asset** | Physics asset to use. If empty, the Skeletal Mesh's default Physics Asset will be used. |
| **Override World Gravity** | Enables specification of a vector value to override gravity for this body. |
| **External Force** | Applies a uniform external force in world space. For example, this allows for easily faking inertia of movement while still simulating in component space. |
| **Overlap Channel** | The channel used to find static geometry to collide with. |
| **Component Space Simulation** | When true, simulation is done in component space. This means velocity is only inherited by animated bodies.|
| **Cached Bounds Scale** | Scale of cached bounds (versus actual bounds). Increasing this may improve performance, but overlaps may not work as well. A value of 1.0 effectively disables cached bounds. |
| **(As Pin) Alpha** | Shows the Alpha property as a pin on the node or in the Details panel. |
| **Alpha Scale Bias** | Set the Minimal and Maximal Influence values for the Alpha property. |

## Using Joints as a Base for Simulation

As of engine version 4.20, the **RigidBody** node supports any joint as a base for simulation by setting **Simulation Space** to **Base Bone Space** and selecting a bone to use as the **Base Bone Ref**. One thing to note however, moving the entire Skeletal Mesh and individually modifying the Base Bone will have no affect on velocities. 

Below is an example of using the **RigidBody** node and simulating from an assigned Base Bone for a weapon.

## Resetting Dynamics

The **RigidBody** node also supports **Reset Dynamics**. To use this, get the Anim Instance from a Skeletal Mesh in Blueprint and use the function call, **Reset Dynamics** to reset the simulation.
