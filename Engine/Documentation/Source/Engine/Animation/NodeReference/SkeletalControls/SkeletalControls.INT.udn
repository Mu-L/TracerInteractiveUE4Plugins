[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Skeletal Controls** (also called **SkelControls**) enables direct control of bones within a [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) asset. These can be used within [Animation Blueprints](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) to control an individual bone, create IK chains, and more. This direct control of the underlying Skeleton provides the ability to create procedural, dynamically-driven animation. The **Transform** of one bone can be used to drive another, or can be used to conform the feet of a character to the ground while 
playing a walk animation. Any sort of modification can be used to tweak or completely override the bone transforms applied by [Animation Sequences](Engine/Animation/Sequences).

## Common Pins and Properties

While the properties available will largely be based on the node itself, some pins and properties are common to all SkeletalControls which are outlined below. 

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Component Pose** | The input pose to be transformed |
| **Alpha** | A float value in the range [0.0, 1.0] to use as the alpha value to determine the weighting of the Transform applied by the SkeletalControl. A value of 0.0 gives full weighting to the input pose, while a value of 1.0 gives full weighting to the control's computed Transform. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Output Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Pose (Blank)** | The final pose after the Transform has been applied |

[EXCERPT:LODThresh]

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **LOD Threshold** | This is the max Level of Detail (LOD) that this node is permitted to run on. For example: if you have LOD Threshold set to 2, it will run until LOD 2, but disable itself once the component's LOD becomes 3. |
