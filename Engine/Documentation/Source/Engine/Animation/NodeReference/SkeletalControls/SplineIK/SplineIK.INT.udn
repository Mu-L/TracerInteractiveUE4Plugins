The **Spline IK **control node constrains a chain of specified bones to a spline within an Animation Blueprint as **Control Points**. 

![](SplineIKnode.png)

Control Points can be driven by external values, with additional options for **Roll** and **Twist** (as well as **Twist Blend** options). 

Below, we add the Spline IK node to our Animation Blueprint to control the character's spine.

See the table below for a full breakdown of the properties available for the Spline IK node. 

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Parameters**[/REGION] ||
| **Start Bone** | Name of the root bone from which the spline extends.|
| **End Bone** | Name of the bone at the end of the spline chain (bones after this will not be altered by the controller). |
| **Bone Axis** | Axis of the controlled bone (for example, the direction of the spline) to use as the direction for the curve. |
| **Auto Calculate Spline** | Whether the number of points in the spline should be automatically generated. |
| **Point Count** | The number of points in the spline if we are not auto-calculating. |
| **(As Pin) Control Points** | Transforms applied to spline points. |
| **(As Pin) Roll** | Overall roll of the spline, applied on top of other rotations along the direction of the spline. |
| **(As Pin) Twist Start** | The twist of the start bone. Twist is interpolated along the spline according to Twist Blend. |
| **(As Pin) Twist End** | The twist of the end bone. Twist is interpolated along the spline according to Twist Blend. |
| **(As Pin) Stretch** | The maximum stretch allowed when fitting bones to the spline. 0.0 means bones do not stretch their length while 1.0 means bones stretch to the length of the spline.|
| **(As Pin) Offset** | The distance along the spline from the start from which bones are constrained. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Twist Blend**[/REGION] ||
| **Blend Option** | The type of [Animation Blending Mode](Engine/Animation/NonLinearBlends) used.  |
| **Custom Curve** | Enables you to specify a Custom Blend option where you specify the curve. |
| **Blend Time** | The duration of the blend. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Settings**[/REGION] ||
| **Alpha** | Current strength of the skeletal control. |
| **Alpha Scale Bias** | Defines the minimum and maximum scale bias for the Alpha property.  |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Performance**[/REGION] ||
| **LOD Threshold** | Max LOD that this node is allowed to run. |

The following table outlines the pins that are enabled by default on the Spline IK node. 

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Component Pose** | The incoming pose. |
| **Alpha** | The current strength of the control. |

Any of the properties denoted with **(As pin)** can be exposed on the node by checking their corresponding checkbox.
