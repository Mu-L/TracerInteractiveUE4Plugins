Title:Two Bone IK
Crumbs: %ROOT%, Engine, Engine/Animation, Engine/Animation/NodeReference, Engine/Animation/NodeReference/SkeletalControls
Description:Describes how the Two Bone IK control can be used to apply IK to a 3-joint chain. 
version: 4.12
topic-image:node_twobone.png



The **Two Bone IK** control applies an Inverse Kinematic (IK) solver to a 3-joint chain, such as the limbs of a character.

Below, a series of **Two Bone IK** controllers are used, along with [](Engine\Animation\NodeReference\SkeletalControls\HandIKRetargeting) to control how the character holds a weapon.

Variables are used to drive the **Join Target Location** properties on the controller for the **hand_l** and **hand_r** bones of our character. 
By adjusting these values we can determine how the character holds the weapon without having to hand-animate different poses based on different characters. 

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**IK**[/REGION] ||
| **IK Bone** | Name of the bone to apply the IK solver to. This should be the bone at the end of the bone chain, i.e. the ankle or wrist bone. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Stretch Limits**[/REGION] ||
| **X** | The ratio of the Max Limb Length, which is used to determine when to scale the bones. |
| **Y** | The maximum allowable amount of scaling of the translation component. |
| **Allow Stretching** | If true, allows the bones to be stretched. |
| [REGION:tablesection]**End Effector**[/REGION] ||
| **Effector Space Bone Name** | The name of the bone to use as the effector location when Effector Location Space is set to BCS_BoneSpace. |
| **Take Rotation from Effector Space** | If enabled, the Rotation of the effector (component, parent, or bone) is applied to the IK Bone.  |
| **Maintain Effector Rel Rot** | If enabled, the IK Bone will maintain its Rotation relative to the effector. [REGION:note]This is overridden when Take Rotation from Effector Space is enabled.[/REGION] |
| **Effector Location Space** | The reference frame for the Effector Location. [INCLUDE:#LocationSpace] |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Join Target**[/REGION] ||
| **Joint Target Location Space** | The reference frame for the Joint Target Location. [INCLUDE:#LocationSpace] |
| **Joint Target Space Bone Name** | The name of the bone to use as the joint target location when Joint Target Location Space is set to BCS_BoneSpace. |

| Pin | Description |
| --- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]**Input Pins**[/REGION] ||
| **Effector Location** | A Vector specifying the location effector in the Effector Location Space. |
| **Joint Target Location** | A Vector specifying the location joint target in the Joint Target Location Space. |

**Two Bone IK** nodes are also affected by the **LOD Threshold** system introduced in 4.11. You can find the setting for this in the **Details Panel** for the **Two Bone IK** node.
