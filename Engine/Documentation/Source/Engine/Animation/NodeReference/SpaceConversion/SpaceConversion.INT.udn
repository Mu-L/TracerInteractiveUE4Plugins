[EXCERPT:Intro]
Poses can either be in local-space or component-space. The **Convert Spaces** nodes available in the **AnimGraph** 
of Animation Blueprints provides the ability to convert poses between local and component space. Local space assumes 
the transform of a bone to be relative to its parent bone. Component space assumes the bone's transform to be relative to 
the SkeletalMeshComponent.

Generally, when working with poses in an Animation Blueprint, they will be in local-space. However, certain blend 
nodes and all SkeletalControls operate in component-space. This means that the input pose needs to be transformed 
prior to being passed in to one of these types of nodes. If the input pose is coming from a node that outputs a local 
space pose, the pose must be converted to the correct space before a SkeletalControl can perform operations on it. 
After performing the operations, the resulting pose must be converted back to 
local space to provide input to additional blends or the Result pin.

Because there is a cost associated with each conversion to or from component space, it is best to group any nodes that 
operate in component-space, such as SkeletalControls, so that they are all performed in a row and limits the number 
of conversions needed.

## Component to Local

The **Component to Local** node converts a component-space pose to a local-space pose.

## Local to Component

The **Local to Component** node converts a local-space pose to a component-space pose.
