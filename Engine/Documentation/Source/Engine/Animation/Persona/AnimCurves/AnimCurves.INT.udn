The **Anim Curves** panel displays curve values for **Morph Target**, **Attribute**, and **Material** curves for the selected skeleton. 
You can delete and rename curves here, as well as preview curve data.
You can filter the visible curves to show only active curves by clicking on **All Curves** to deselect it, which also enables you to filter by **Morph Target**, **Attribute**, and **Material** curves with checkboxes.
In addition, you can define [Material Curves](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves) which enable you to drive Material Parameters or Morph Curves. 

To open the **Anim Curves** panel in either the **Skeleton Editor** or **Animation Editor**: 

* Click on the **Window** menu, then select **Anim Curves** from the dropdown menu.

By default, as you play an animation back, the curve values will update along with the playback. In the image below, curves for **L_smile_pose** and **R_smile_pose** are being used to create a smile on the face mesh. 
The values of these curves are shown in the **Anim Curves** panel at the current point in the animation (where the full smile is achieved by being weighted at **1.0** when reaching the end of the animation).

If you uncheck the **Auto** checkbox for a particular curve, it will no longer pull data from the curve. This allows you to selectively turn off the influence of a curve and preview the result. You can
also enter a value manually or by clicking and dragging on the **Weight** field. In the below image, the **L_brow_up_pose** curve value has been manually set to 1.0. You can see the effect
in the viewport, as the left eyebrow of the face is raised all the way.

## Managing Curves

**To rename a curve:**

1. Right-click on the curve and select **Rename** from the dropdown menu.

1. Enter your new name.

1. Press **Enter** to save your new name.

**To add a curve**:

1. Right-click on any curve and select **Add** from the dropdown menu.

	![](AddCurve.png)

1. Enter your new curve's name.

	![](NewNameAddCurve.png)

1. Press **Enter** to save your new name.

This adds a curve to the current skeleton, but you will need to then add the curve and set its information in the **Animation Editor** to determine what the curve affects.

**To delete a curve:**

1. Right-click on the curve and select **Delete** from the dropdown menu.

	If the curve is currently being used by any assets in your project, a confirmation window will appear warning you that the curves will be removed from those assets. 

1. Click **Yes** to continue with the deletion, or **No** to cancel.


## Linking Curves to Bones

You can link your Animation Curves to a specific bone in the Skeleton so that they can be culled out with the bone when changing Levels of Detail (LOD) for the Skeletal Mesh, which is
useful when setting up facial animations that aren't needed for lower LODs. This feature can also be used in conjunction with layer blending to prevent overriding curve values from the
incorrect layer. 

1. In the **Anim Curves** viewer window, select the curve that you want to link to a particular bone in your Skeleton.

1. With the curve selected, in the **Details** panel, click the **add** (**+**) button to add Connected Bone(s) elements.

	Then use the dropdown next to the added bone, to select the bone you want to link to the curve. The list here will be populated based on the Skeleton's bone heirarchy.

1. Now that your curve is assigned to the bone(s) you've added to the Connected Bones, you can move the camera towards or away from the mesh to see the linked curves cull from view when the LOD of the mesh changes.
