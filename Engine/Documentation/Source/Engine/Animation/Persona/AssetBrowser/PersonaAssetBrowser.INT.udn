**Double-clicking** on an asset in the **Asset Browser** will open the asset inside the **Animation Editor** so that you can preview the animation.

This will also populate the [Asset Details](Engine/Animation/Persona\AnimAssetDetails) window with varying options based on the asset type clicked. 

Each asset in the **Asset Browser** is color-coded and uses the same color-coding found during animation asset creation from the **Content Browser**.

By default, the Advanced Details column view in the **Asset Browser** is hidden. You can un-hide the Advanced Details with the **Reset Columns** option from the **View Options**.

This will give you more information about each asset as well as the ability for advanced column sorting. 

You can also highlight an asset in the **Asset Browser** to display a tooltip containing information about that asset as well as a preview.
