The **Asset Editor** inside the Animation Editor provides you with the ability to perform animation focused editing based on your selected animation asset type. 
By **Double-clicking** on an animation asset in the **Content Browser** (or inside the [](Engine/Animation/Persona/AssetBrowser)), the **Asset Editor** window will change based on the type of asset opened. 
For example, when you open any [Animation Sequence](Engine/Animation/Sequences) the **Asset Editor** will appear as shown below.

Inside the **Asset Editor** for an Animation Sequence, you can: 

* Create [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Notifies) which are like events that are fired off at defined points within an animation. 
* Create [](Engine/Animation/Sequences/Curves) which allow you to change the value of a Material Parameter or Morph Target while an animation is playing back. 
* Create [Animation Layers](Engine/Animation/AnimHowTo/LayerEditing) which allow you to modify any Animation Sequence as part of Additive Layer Tracks. 

When opening a [Blend Space](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces), the **Asset Editor** changes to allow you to modify how the Blend Space functions.

Regardless of the animation asset type that is opened, across the bottom, you will see the **Playback Toolbar**.

You can playback your animation in forward or reverse modes as well as step through the animation backward or forward frame-by-frame. 
You can also use the **Record** option to create a new animation object based on your currently selected animation. This will prompt you to define a name and save location for the new asset and will begin recording from the current asset. 
To stop recording, click the **Record** button again and the new animation asset will be created.
