[EXCERPT:Overview]

The **Explorer** panel displays a tree list of the graphs, functions, state machines, etc. contained 
within the **Animation Blueprint**. This is essentially an outline of the Animation Blueprint that lets you easily view 
existing elements of the Animation Blueprint.

## Explorer Tree Depth

A series of buttons at the top of the **Explorer Panel** lets you select how much information you want 
to display in the explorer.

You can choose from Graphs, Events, Nodes, and Pins.  The deeper you go, the more stuff you will see 
in the tree.   

| Level | Depth |
| ----- | ----- |
| Graphs | Only graphs and other top-level objects will be displayed. |
| Events | All top level objects as well as all the events contained within those will be listed. |
| Nodes | Top level objects, events, and every node is shown. |
| Pins | Everything down to the pin level, including color-coded icons, and (soon) their values, will be displayed. |

## Searching in the Explorer

The **Explorer** panel contains a text box used for searching the graphs belonging to the **Animation Blueprint**. 
This works the same way as the contextual action menu that you use for adding new nodes, but is limited 
to searching items found within the explorer.  You can search based on name, comment, and other data.  
So, if you know you have a node that is **SetActorHidden**, you can type that in the box, and the explorer 
will show you all the **SetActorHidden** nodes in your graph.

You can also search on more things, like searching `bool` to see all pins that deal with Boolean values. 
Or, search for `123` to find all pins that have their default values set to `123`, and so on.

[REGION:tip]
  **Tip:** By default, **Ctrl + F** will jump directly to the search box so you can start typing. This can 
  be modified in the [Key Bindings](Engine/UI/KeyBindings).
