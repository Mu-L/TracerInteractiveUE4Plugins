The **Animation Blueprint Editor** is where you specify the logic the drives your character's animations and can be accessed by opening any **Animation Blueprint** from the **Content Browser** (or from the **Editor Toolbar**). 
This editor is very similar to working with the [Blueprint Editor](Engine/Blueprints) as it uses the same visual node based scripting system with an emphasis on animation features like managing animation [](Engine/Animation/StateMachines), using [](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/Blend) to control [](Engine/Animation/AnimationBlending), or direct [Skeletal Control](Engine/Animation/NodeReference/SkeletalControls) through script. 

[REGION:note]
For more information on working with **Animation Blueprints** and the **Animation Blueprint Editor**, refer to the [Animation Blueprints](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) documentation.
