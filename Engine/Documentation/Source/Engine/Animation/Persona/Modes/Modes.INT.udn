[EXCERPT:Overview]
Creating animated characters in Unreal Engine 4 involves using several different Animation Tools (or Editors), each of which focus on different aspects of animation. 

For instance, the **Skeleton Editor** is where everything starts as it is used to manage the bone (or joint hierarchy) that drives the Skeletal Mesh and the animation. 
The **Skeletal Mesh Editor** is used to modify the Skeletal Mesh that is linked to a Skeleton and is the outward appearance of a character. 
The **Animation Editor** allows you to create and modify your animation assets and is where the tuning/tweaking of animation assets are done. 
The **Animation Blueprint Editor** can be used to create logic that drives what animations a character uses and when as well as how animations are blended together. 
Finally, the **Physics Asset Editor** can be used to create and edit the physics bodies that will be used for your Skeletal Meshes collision.
