[TOC (start:2 end:2)]

The **Preview Scene Settings** panel enables you to quickly assess what your assets will look like in multiple environments and light scenarios without having to set up these scenes within your level. Several different settings can be defined and applied from Skeletal Meshes to lighting and Post Process effects all within each of the [Animation Tools](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes) inside the editor.

The location of the Preview Scene Settings panel can be found in the upper-right corner of the [Animation Tool](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes) you are using.

If you close the Preview Scene Settings panel, you can re-enable it from the **Window** option from the menu toolbar.

You can also access the Preview Scene Setting panel from the **Viewport Options** drop-down menu.

## Animation

The **Preview Controller** enables you to define how the preview is animated.  
  

| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Default** | Defaults to the Animation Tool's setting |
| **Reference Pose** | Uses the reference pose for the Skeletal Mesh |
| **Use Specific Animation** | Enables you to define an animation to use.  |
| **Live Link Preview Controller** | Enables you to preview using the [Live Link](Engine\Animation\LiveLinkPlugin) settings. |

## Mesh

This section enables you to change the Skeletal Mesh used for previewing.

![](Mesh.png)

  
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Preview Mesh (Animation)** | The Skeletal Mesh to use for previewing. |

Each type of asset, whether it's an Animation Sequence, Animation Blueprint, or a Skeleton can store and be overridden with different Preview Meshes. The order of overriding goes from Skeleton to Asset, so if an asset doesn't have an override, it defaults to the Skeleton's Preview Mesh.

## Additional Meshes

This section enables you to include additional Skeletal Meshes to the preview scene as part of a **Preview Mesh Collection**.

![](AdditionalMeshes_01.png "AdditionalMeshes_01.png")

  
| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Allow Different Skeletons** | When selecting an additional mesh, whether or not to filter by the current Skeleton. |
| **Allow Custom AnimBP Override** | When using a preview collection, allow it to override custom Animation Blueprints. |
| **Additional Meshes** | The Preview Mesh Collection to use as included meshes for previewing. |
| **Skeletal Meshes** | The Skeletal Mesh assets that are included in the specified Preview Mesh Collection. |

Preview Mesh Collections are useful when you have several Skeletal Meshes that are related (like components of a character). Preview Mesh Collections are also very flexible and support the use of unsaved assets within an unsaved collection. They can also be extended by projects that might need to interface with other systems that can "build" a Skeletal Mesh out of other Skeletal Mesh parts.

## Settings

This section contains various settings for **Lighting**, **Environment**, and **Post Processing**, that define the makeup of the viewport for previewing as well as establishing **Profiles**.

| Option | Description |

| **Profile Name** | Name to identify the profile. |
| **Shared Profile** | Whether or not this profile should be stored in the project.ini file. |

Settings can be saved as a **Profile** and you can add or switch between Profiles from the Profiles menu at the bottom of the window.
