[EXCERPT:Overview]
The **Skeleton Tree** panel shows the skeletal hierarchy of the current [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) asset. Within it, you can perform the following actions: 

* Select and view specific bones in the skeletal hierarchy.
* Create and edit [Sockets](Engine/Content\Types\SkeletalMeshes\Sockets), which are bone-offset attachment points for props and other items.
* Create preview assets, which are temporarily attached assets; these are good for previewing how a weapon will look on a character, for example.
* Control settings for [Animation Retargeting](Engine/Animation/AnimHowTo/Retargeting) (when **Show Advanced Options** is checked).

### Search Line

![](SearchLine.png)

The **Search** line allows for quick filtering of the Skeletal hierarchy by filtering out the hierarchy to only include names based on the entered text. 

![](SeachFiltering.png)

[REGION:caption]
Above, we have filtered the hierarchy to only include Bone Names, Sockets or Preview Objects that include the text **Spine** in them. 
[/REGION]

### Bone Hierarchy List

![](BoneHierarchyList.png)

This window shows all the Bones, Sockets and Preview Objects currently used by the selected Skeleton Asset. 
Inside this window is where you can add and assign Sockets and Preview Objects as well as adjust Translation Retargeting options. 
Most of the adjustments made in the Bone Hierarchy list is handled through **Right-click** context menus where the menu options vary based on the object you right-click on (see the context menu sections below).

#### Bone Context Menu

When **Right-clicking** on a bone, you will see the following context menu:

![](SkeletonContextMenu_Bone.png)

| **Name** | **Description** |
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Socket Actions[/REGION]||
|**Add Socket** | Adds a new Socket to the currently selected bone. Note that if you have hidden Sockets using the button near the top of the **Skeleton Tree**, then this option will be grayed out. |
|**Paste Selected Socket** | If you have copied a Socket to the clipboard (**Right-click** and choose Copy Selected Socket), then this will paste that socket onto the selected bone.|
|[REGION:tablesection]Selected Bone Actions[/REGION]||
|**Copy Selected Bone Names**|Copies the selected bone names to the clipboard. This is useful if you should need to enter a complex bone name into a property field.|
| [REGION:tablesection]Bone Translation Retargeting[/REGION]||
|**Recursively Set Translation Retargeting Skeleton**|This recursively sets the bone and all of its children to use Translation Retargeting based off the Skeleton. See the [Translation Retargeting Controls](#translationretargetingcontrols)
|**Recursively Set Translation Retargeting Animation**|This recursively sets the bone and all of its children to use Translation Retargeting based off the Animation. See the [Translation Retargeting Controls](#translationretargetingcontrols)
|**Recursively Set Translation Retargeting AnimationScaled**|This recursively sets the bone and all of its children to use Translation Retargeting based off the scaled Animation. See the [Translation Retargeting Controls](#translationretargetingcontrols)
|**Recursively Set Translation Retargeting AnimationRelative**|This recursively sets the bone and all of its children to use Translation Retargeting relative to the Animation. See the [Translation Retargeting Controls](#translationretargetingcontrols)
| [REGION:tablesection]LOD Bone Reduction[/REGION]||
|**Remove Selected Bone from...**| Places the selected bone and its children on the Bones to Remove list for a certain LOD level within the LOD settings. See LOD Settings for more information.|
|**Add Remove Selected Bone to...**| Removes the selected bone from the Bones to Remove list for the specified LOD level. See LOD Settings for more information.|
| [REGION:tablesection]Attached Assets Actions[/REGION]||
|**Add Preview Asset**| Opens a menu of all eligible assets that can be temporarily attached to a bone for previewing purposes. For instance, if you want to see what a certain piece of armor would look like attached a bone, this is the option you would use. Note, however, that this is not a permanent attachment and will only be visible while previewing. |

### Socket Context Menu

When **Right-clicking** on a [Socket](Engine/Content\Types\SkeletalMeshes\Sockets), you  will see the following context menu:

![](SkeletonContextMenu_Socket.png)

| **Name** | **Description** |
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Selected Item Actions[/REGION]||
| **Delete** | Deletes a selected Socket.  |
|[REGION:tablesection]Selected Socket Actions[/REGION]||
|**Copy Selected Sockets**| Copies the selected socket to the clipboard for pasting on to other bones.|
| **Rename Socket** | Allows you to rename a selected Socket.  |
|**Create Mesh Socket**| Copies the Socket from the Skeleton asset onto the specific Skeletal mesh being used. In this way, a Socket can be edited for characters using the same Skeleton asset, but having different mesh proportions.|
|**Delete Mesh Socket** | This is only available when **Right-clicking** on a Socket that has been made into a Mesh Socket. This removes the Mesh copy of the socket, leaving only the original Socket on the Skeleton asset.|
| [REGION:tablesection]Attached Assets Actions[/REGION]||
|**Add Preview Asset**| Opens a menu of all eligible assets that can be temporarily attached to a bone for previewing purposes. For instance, if you want to see what a certain piece of armor would look like attached a bone, this is the option you would use. Note, however, that this is not a permanent attachment and will only be visible while previewing. |
|**Remove All Attached Assets**| Removed all attached Preview Assets from this socket.|


### Preview Asset Context Menu

A **Preview Asset** is an asset, such as a Static Mesh or Skeletal Mesh, that has been temporarily attached to a bone or Socket for Previewing purposes.

When **Right-clicking** on a Preview Asset, you will see the following context menu:


![](SkeletonContextMenu_PreviewAsset.png)

| **Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Selected Asset Actions[/REGION]||
|**Delete**|Removes the selected Preview Asset.|
| [REGION:tablesection]Attached Asset Actions[/REGION]||
|**Add Preview Asset**| Opens a menu of all eligible assets that can be temporarily attached to a bone for previewing purposes. For instance, if you want to see what a certain piece of armor would look like attached to a bone, this is the option you would use. Note, however, that this is not a permanent attachment and will only be visible while previewing. |
|**Remove All Preview Assets**|Deletes all Preview Assets currently on the mesh.|


## Blend Profile and Skeleton Options

![](BlendProfileSection.png)

At the bottom of the Skeleton Tree window are the Blend Profile and Skeleton Options buttons. 

### Blend Profiles

A Blend Profile is a set of per-bone scales that can be used in transitions and blend lists to tweak the weights of specific bones. 
The scales are applied to a normal weight for that bone. 
You can create/name your Blend Profile from the drop-down menu then specify the per-bone scales next to each bone with the Blend Profile Scale setting.

![](BlendProfile.png)

### Skeleton Options

![](SkeletonOptionsWindow.png)

The Skeleton Options window allow you show or hide Skeleton Retargeting Options as well as Bones and Sockets. 

#### Translation Retargeting Controls

With **Show Retargeting Options** enabled from the **Skeleton Options** menu, the Bone Hierarchy window will update with addition options. 
The right column of buttons in the **Skeleton Tree** controls how you want to handle translation [retargeting](Engine/Animation/AnimationRetargeting) on your skeletal mesh. The dropdowns allow you to specify what will be used as the basis for retargeting: the skeleton's bone information, the animation rotation data, or the animation as applied to a scaled character.

Each dropdown allows you to control how that specific bone will handle retargeting and what will be used as the basis for that retarget. 

![](RetargetingControls.png)

Each button contains the following three options. 

[REGION:note]
Note that you can change these settings recursively on each child of a selected bone by **Right-clicking** and selecting the recursive commands in the context menu.
[/REGION]

|Name|Description|
|---|---|
|**Animation**|Use translation from animation.|
|**Skeleton**|Use translation from skeleton.|
|**AnimationScaled**|Use translation from animation, scale length by the Skeleton's proportions. |
|**AnimationRelative**|Use relative translation from animation similar to an additive animation. |

#### Show/Hide Bones and Sockets

The **Bone** and **Socket** section of the **Skeleton Options** menu are used to control visibility over various bone and Socket types. 

[REGION:raw]
![](BonesMenu.png)
[/REGION]

| Option					| Description														|
|---------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
|**Show All Bones**			| Shows all bones available in the skeleton.						|
|**Show Mesh Bones**		| Shows only those bones that are exclusive to this Skeletal Mesh.	|
|**Show Weighted Bones**	| Shows only those bones which have vertices weighted to them.		|
|**Hide Bones**				| Hides all bones, showing only Sockets and preview assets.			|

[REGION:raw]
![](SocketsMenu.png)
[/REGION]


| Option | Description |
|---|---|
|**Show Active Sockets**	| Shows only active Sockets. When you customize a Socket (**Right-click** and choose Customize Socket), the Socket is copied from the Skeleton onto the mesh, making a special socket that is exclusive to this Skeletal Mesh and not shared by any other Skeletal Meshes using the same Skeleton. When you do that, the new customized Socket - also known as a Mesh Socket - becomes active and the original Socket, which remains a part of the Skeleton asset, is considered inactive. In effect, this will hide away any Sockets on the Skeleton that has a customized Mesh Socket counterpart. |
|**Show Mesh Sockets**		| Shows only customized Sockets, which are those Sockets that are exclusive to this Skeletal Mesh and are not used by any other Skeletal Mesh that shares a Skeleton asset with this one.  |
|**Show Skeleton Sockets**	| Shows only those Sockets which are non-customized, meaning those which are part of the Skeleton asset and are not exclusive to this Skeletal Mesh. |
|**Show All Sockets**		|Shows all Sockets available on the Skeletal Mesh. |
|**Hide Sockets**			| Hides all Sockets. |
