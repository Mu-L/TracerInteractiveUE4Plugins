[EXCERPT:Overview]
Each of the Animation Tools contains a **Viewport** window which allows you to preview playback of your animation assets. 
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

[REGION:note]
When opening a Blend Space or Aim Offset, the animation will play automatically if **Preview** is enabled. If you pause or disable the looping option in an AnimationSequence or AnimationMontage and then open a Blend Space or Aim Offset, the animation will not automatically play. You will need to set an animation to play/looping in order for it to autostart when opening a Blend Space or Aim Offset.
