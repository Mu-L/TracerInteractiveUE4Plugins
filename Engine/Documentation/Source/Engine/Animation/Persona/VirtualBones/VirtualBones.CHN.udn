Inside the [Animation Tools Editors](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes), namely the Skeleton or Animation Editors, you can add **Virtual Bones** to the Skeleton of your mesh. 
These serve to help improve iteration time by enabling you to change your target joint hierarchy for IK or aim inside of the Editor. Before this feature was added, you would 
have to do this outside of the engine to add them to your asset in your modeling application and then reimport all the animations in order to fix the animation data with the 
new joints included. 

Virtual Bones, by their very nature, are not skinnable, but, instead, constrained between two existing bones on the Skeleton and they automatically have data generated for them 
for each animation on the Skeleton. For example, you can add a joint that is a child of a hand, but is constrained to the palm joint. Unlike sockets, this joint can be used 
in Animation Blueprints as a target, such as an IK target or look at target, or you could even modify them in the Animation Blueprint for later use. 

[REGION:note]
For additional information and some practical usage suggestions for Virtual Bones, check out the [Animation Techniques used in Paragon](https://youtu.be/1UOY-FMm-xo?list=PL-j8pRjjCYWENU4on8on7b0pEbrmwlzlM) 
for more information. In Paragon, Virtual Bones have so far been used to make it easier to retarget or change reference frames for controllers and is also used for orientation 
and slope warping.

## Adding Virtual Bones to your Skeleton

To add Virtual Bones to your Skeletal Mesh:

1. In the **Content Browser**, open any Skeletal Mesh or Animation Asset. For the purpose of this example, the Third Person Template character is being used.

1. In the **Animation Tool Editors** (Skeletal or Animation), select any Bone from the joint hierarchy from the **Skeleton Tree** window. Now, right-click and hover over **Add Virtual Bone** from the context menu. 
 Select a bone from the **Pick Target Bone** window that opens.

1. Now that you've added your Virtual Bone(s), you will see it listed in the Skeleton hierarchy. These are indicated by the prefix "VB" in their name and their lavender color in the Skeleton Tree window.

	[REGION:tip]
	If you do not see your bones in the Viewport of the Skeleton or Animation Editors, go to **Show** > **Bones** > **All Hierarchy** so that your Skeleton is always visible. There are also other options here
	to fit your preference if you do not want to always see all the bones in the viewport.

	In the Animation Editor, you will see your Virtual Bone(s) constrained between the selected joints and that it updates with your animation.
