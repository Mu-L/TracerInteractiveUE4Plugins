[EXCERPT:Intro]
Playback of **Animation Sequences** can be performed through code, but is generally handled within an instance 
of an Animation Blueprint applied to a Skeletal Mesh Component. All of the Animation Sequences for the Skeleton 
the Animation Blueprint was created from are available to be sampled within the **AnimGraph**. 
These can be placed as sequence player nodes whose output is a pose generated by sampling the Animation Sequences.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

**To place a sequence player:**

1. **Right-click** in the AnimGraph of your [Animation Blueprint](Engine/Animation/AnimBlueprints) and expand the **Animations** category.

1. Select the Animation Sequence to be sampled from the list. A node is placed in the graph for the sequence.

1. The pose output of the new node can be connected to a corresponding pose input on any animation node to sample the animation.
