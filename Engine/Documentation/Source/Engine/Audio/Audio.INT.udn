[EXCERPT:Intro]
Sound is immensely important to creating believable and immersive environments. From ambient sounds in the level, to interactive sounds from vehicles or weapons, to 
spoken dialog from the characters, the audio in the game can make or break the user's experience. Making the audio in the game actually sound like it should sound
 can be a difficult task. Unreal Engine 4's audio system provides tools and features to mold the sounds in the game to give them the desired feel. This is important 
 because it means that a clean version of the sound can be produced once in an external application, imported, and then crafted within the engine to create the 
 appropriate result.
