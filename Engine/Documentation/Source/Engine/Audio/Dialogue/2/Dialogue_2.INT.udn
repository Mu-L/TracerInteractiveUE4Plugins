For this example, we are just going to implement a greeting from Quest NPC to Adam and Zoe. For more information about complex dialogue, see the [Sound Cues and Dialogue](Engine/Audio/Dialogue/2) section.
Each line of dialogue needs a **Dialogue Wave** asset associated with it.

1. Go back to the **Content Browser**, and create a new **Dialogue Wave** asset.

1. Name the new asset **QuestGreeting**, then **double-click** to open it.

1. For the **Spoken Text**, enter "Hey! Could you come over here? I need your help with something important."

	Although the same text would be spoken when the NPC is talking to Adam and Zoe, the game design document gives us some hints that the way the text is spoken might be different for each listener. That means we
	should set up two different **Dialogue Contexts**.

1. One context is already created by default. Fill in the **Speaker** entry with **Quest NPC**.

1. Click on the plus sign icon to add a listener.

1. Set the **Directed At** entry to **Adam**.

1. Click on **Add Dialogue Context** to add a new **Dialogue Context**.

1. Set this context's **Speaker** to **Quest NPC**, and **Directed At** to **Zoe**.

We could also make some notes about how the voice actor should sound friendlier toward Zoe, as they have a shared military background, and be more abrupt with Adam, who she doesn't trust because of his mercenary past. These would go in the **Voice Actor Direction** field.
Finally, after the voice actor recordings come back, we would import those as **Sound Waves** and set them in the **Sound Wave** field for each context.
In this example, we are not going to create **Sound Waves**, but you could use **Sound Waves** from the **Starter Content** to test.

[REGION:tip]
The **Dialogue Wave** is also where you can set a **Subtitle Override**. This is useful for effort sounds, as well as some other cases, such as characters speaking in a foreign language not known to the player.
