When you first run Unreal Editor, the **Project Browser** will appear.

![](ProjectBrowserBoth.png)(w:800)

The Project Browser provides a jumping off point from which you can create projects, open your existing projects, or open sample content like sample games and Showcases.


[REGION:tip]
To bypass the Project Browser and instantly open the editor for a specific game, you can pass the name of the game as a command line argument to the executable.

## Opening Projects

The first tab in the Project Browser is the **Projects** tab. 

![](OpenProject_single.png)(w:800)

This shows a thumbnailed list of all the projects that have been discovered by the editor. By default, this includes all projects in the installation folder, any projects created with the 
Editor, or any projects that have been previously opened.

**Double-click** any thumbnail to open that project.

The thumbnail for a project is a 192x192 `.png` file with the same name as the project in the project folder. It is possible to bind a key to "Update Project Thumbnail" to quickly take
a screenshot to be the thumbnail of your project. If you do not supply a thumbnail for your project, a screenshot is automatically taken every time you exit the editor for that project. 

To search for projects, enter text in the **Filter Projects...** search box.

You can also click on the **Browse...** button to navigate your computer and select a `.uproject` file to open manually.  

[REGION:tip]
In the **Projects** tab, you can check the **Always load last project on startup** checkbox to automatically open your most recent project and skip the **Project Browser**. To change
this setting in-editor: 
1. Open the [Editor Preferences](Engine/UI/EditorSettings) window.
1. Navigate to **General** > **Loading & Saving**.
1. Under the **Startup** heading, toggle **Load the Most Recently Loaded Project at Startup**.

This tab also opens when you select **File** > **Open Project** from within Unreal Editor.

## Creating New Projects

[EXCERPT:creatingprojects]
The second tab in the Project Browser is the **New Project** tab. 

![](NewProject_FPSExample.png)(w:800)


The **New Project** tab gives you starting templates for your projects. The **Blank** project creates a completely empty project. 
The other templates fall into two categories: **Blueprints Only** and **C++**.  

For example, there is a **Side Scroller (Blueprints Only)** template and a **Side Scroller (C++)** template.  The games generated by these two templates play the same way, with the same level design,
character behavior, and camera layout.  The difference is how the initial framework for the projects is created:  

* **Blueprints Only** - The initial gameplay is defined with Blueprints. Blueprints are Unreal Engine 4's visual scripting assets.  With Blueprints, it is possible to create gameplay behavior in 
Unreal Editor without needing to write C++ code. However, starting from a _Blueprints Only_ template does not mean that you can never include C++ code in your project.  It simply 
means that the initial examples provided will be in Blueprints.   

* **C++** - The initial gameplay is defined with C++ code.  Projects created with _C++_ templates can be managed through the Unreal Editor, but they can also be edited in Visual Studio. Just like 
_Blueprints Only_ projects can be extended with C++ code, it is simple to add Blueprints to a project that began as a _C++_ template.  


**To create a new project:**
1. Select a template from the list.
1. Select whether or not to copy Starter Content into your project.
1. Enter a name for your project.
1. Click **Create**.

To save your project outside of the default save location, you can click on the arrow icon to toggle display of the full path and file creation preview.

 ![](new_project_advanced.png)(w:800)

 Your new project will open in the editor if it is based on the Blank template or a Blueprints template, and in Visual Studio or XCode if it is based on a C++ template.

This tab also opens when you select **File** > **New Project** from within Unreal Editor.

## Project Settings 
![](Project_Options.png)
**Project Settings** allows you to setup different performance options for your project depending on what type of hardware you are targeting.  Do not worry if you do not know what settings you want as you can change them at any time in the **[Project Settings - Target Hardware]**.

| Icon | Description|
| --------|---------|
| ![](Desktop_Console_Option.png) | Use this option if the game you are making is going to target Desktops or Consoles. |
| ![](Mobile_Option.png) | Use this option if the game you are making is going to target Mobile devices. |
| ![](Maximum_Quality_Option.png)| Use this option if the game you are making is going to target high end devices like Desktops or Consoles. |
| ![](Scalable_Quality_Option.png)| Use this option if the game you are making is going to target Mobile devices. |
|![](With_Starter_Content_Option.png) | Use this option if you want to include the [Starter Content](Engine/Content/Packs) with your game. |
