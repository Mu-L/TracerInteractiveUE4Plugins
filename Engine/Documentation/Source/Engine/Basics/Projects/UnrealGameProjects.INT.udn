[COMMENT:none]

Projects can be one of two types:

* **Content-Only** - These are projects where all development is done through the editor using content assets such as maps, art assets, _Blueprints_, etc.
* **Code** - These projects allow programmer development in addition to regular content development available in _content-only_ projects. 

[REGION:tip]
Content projects can be converted to code projects using the [](Programming/Development/ManagingGameCode/CppClassWizard).
