This page contains information on tools and procedures for editing **Blueprint Spline Components** and **Blueprint Spline Mesh Components** in the Level Editor. As of 4.13, **Blueprint Spline Components** can also be edited in the **Blueprint Editor Viewport** using all the tools and procedures below.

## Tools

With a Spline Point (selecting a Spline Curve selects the last point on it) selected in the editor, you can use the standard manipulation tools (move, rotate, and scale) to select and adjust the positions and tangents of the spline curve's points.

| Tool | Result |
| --- | :--- |
| **Move Selected Point** | [REGION:asyncgif]![](MovePoint.gif)[/REGION] |
| **Move Selected Tangent** | [REGION:asyncgif]![](MoveTangent.gif)[/REGION] |
| **Rotate** | [REGION:asyncgif]![](RotatePoint.gif)[/REGION] |
| **Scale** | [REGION:asyncgif]![](ScalePoint.gif)[/REGION] |


## Procedures

There are a few menus accessable by right-clicking on the spline either on a point, on the curve inbetween points.

### Right-Click on a Spline Point

Right-clicking on a point will give you the following menu and options:

[REGION:raw]
| Option | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Delete Spline Point** | Removes the selected Spline Point. |
| **Duplicate Spline Point** | Duplicates the currently selected Spline Point. |
| **Spline Point Type** | [INCLUDE:#SplinePointType] |
| **Reset to Automatic Tangent** | [INCLUDE:#ResetToAutomaticTanget] |
| **Reset to Default** | Resets the Spline to its archetype default. |
| **Visualize Roll and Scale** | Whether or not the spline should visualize roll and scale in the editor. |
| **Allow Discontinous Splines** | Toggles whether the visualization allows **Arrive** and **Leave** tangents to be set separately. |
[/REGION]

[COMMENT:none]

[EXCERPT:SplinePointType]

Changes the interpolation style for the selected Spline Point. The Spline Curve associated with the Spline Curve point is displayed in red (by default). It will be the curve affected by changing this. The default **Point Type** is **Curve**. Below are examples of what the different types look like:
