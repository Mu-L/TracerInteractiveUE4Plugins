1. **Graph Area** - This is where you will actually lay out all of your nodes.
1. **Forward and Back Buttons** - These allow you to jump between different graphs very much as you would navigate a web browser.
1. **Tabs area** - As you open different graphs, tabs for each one will open here, allowing you to quickly jump between different graphs.
1. **Breadcrumbs** - These show a progression of graphs and subgraphs. As you step down into functions or collapsed graphs, this will show you where you are within your network.
1. **Zoom Factor** - This simply shows the current zoom ratio in the graph editor.
1. **Blueprint label** - This shows the type of Blueprint you are editing. As you edit Blueprint Interfaces, Animation Blueprints, Macros, and other types, this label will update.
