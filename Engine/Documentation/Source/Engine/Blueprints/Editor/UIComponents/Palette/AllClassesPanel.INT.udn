[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **Palette** panel displays a list of all functions and variables that can be used in Blueprints. It is fully searchable, contains a **Favorites** panel that you can populate with the nodes you find yourself using the most, and you can filter it to search for nodes that are compatible with a specific class type. Nodes from the **Palette** panel can be added into your networks by simply dragging and dropping them from the list.

## Class Filtering

Sometimes it is useful to filter down the **Palette** to only show those nodes that are compatible with a given class type. This is done using the **Class Filter** dropdown. When clicked, it shows a list of all classes available in your project, similar to the [Class Viewer](Engine/UI/ClassViewer) panel. It also contains a search bar that you can use to actively filter down the list.
