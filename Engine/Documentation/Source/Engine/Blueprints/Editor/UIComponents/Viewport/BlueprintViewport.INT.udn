[REGION:note]
You can also manipulate a selected component by adjusting its values manually in the [Details](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/Details) panel.

Selecting a component in the [Component](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Components) list selects that component in the **Viewport** too, and populates the **Details** panel with its property information. 

You can use the transformation widgets in the **Viewport** to adjust the location, rotation, and scale of selected components. For more information about transformation widgets, see [Interactive Transforms](Engine/Actors/Transform#InteractiveTransformation).

You can navigate in the Blueprint Editor's **Viewport** in the same ways in which you navigate in the Level Editor's **Viewport**. For more information, see [Viewport Controls](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls).

## The View Menu

The **View** drop-down menu, in the **Viewport**'s upper-left corner, has somewhat different options than the Level Editor's **Viewport** menus.
