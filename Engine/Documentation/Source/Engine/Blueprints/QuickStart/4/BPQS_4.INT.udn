To start adding behavior to your Blueprint Class, you will need to open it in the Blueprint Editor.  

1. **Double-click** the Blueprint Class in the **Content Browser**.

1. The **Blueprint Editor** will open, and you can see your **Cube** and **Box** components in a viewport. 

	[REGION:note]
	At this point, if you adjust the **Box** Component's placement, it will be applied to all launchpads you make from this Blueprint Class. Just like when you were working with components on your 
	LaunchPad Actor, you can select the **Box** component in the **Components** list and adjust the location. Try a **Location** of (0.0, 0.0, 50.0).

1. Docked next to the **Viewport** tab is a **Construction Script** tab and an **Event Graph** tab. Since you are going to be creating gameplay behavior, you should start with the **Event Graph**. Click on that tab now.

	Events are the starting point of your Blueprint graph's execution, and can be associated with a number of different gameplay situations. 
	A selection of the most commonly used events are visible right away, seen as translucent Event nodes. Though certainly useful for many of your Blueprint graphs, we will be making 
	one of our very own. 

1. We want an event that will execute when anything overlaps our **Box** component. First, select the **Box** component in the **Components** tab.

1. **Right-click** in an empty spot in your graph to bring up the context menu of nodes you could add to the graph.

	[REGION:note]
	To move around in the graph, **Right-click** and drag around. At this point, you could drag the graph to the left, moving the pre-placed event nodes off the left side of the screen and creating more 
	blank space to create your launchpad logic in.

1. We are adding an event for this Component, so expand the **Add Event for Box** dropdown, and then **Collision**. You could also use the search box, using "Component Begin Overlap" to filter the menu.

1. Select **On Component Begin Overlap**. 

	![](AddEvent.png)

Your graph now has an **OnComponentBeginOverlap** node. Any nodes connected to this event will execute when something overlaps the Box component of your launchpad.

In the next step of this Quick Start, you will begin connecting nodes to the output pins of this node, and learn more about working with nodes in Blueprints.
