Right now, that **OnComponentBeginOverlap** event will execute when anything overlaps the Box trigger. We only want to actually execute our launching behavior, though, if the overlapping
thing is our avatar, or Pawn. Think of it as asking "Is the Actor overlapping the Box trigger the same Actor as our Pawn?" 

We will do that by working with the Other Actor output from the **OnComponentBeginOverlap** event. 

1. Click on the **Other Actor** pin on the **OnComponentBeginOverlap** event, and drag into an empty spot on the graph and release to pull up the context menu.

	[REGION:tip]
	The context menu is adaptive, filtering by the pin you are currently working with to show you only nodes that are compatible.  
	[/REGION]
1. Type "=" into the search box to filter the available nodes, then select **Equals (Object)**.

	We could set **Side Scroller Char** as the other input to the **Equals** node, but then if we changed the Character we were using, we would need to re-open this Blueprint and manually update that. 
	Instead, lets get a reference to the current Pawn we are using.

1. **Right-click** in an empty part of the graph to bring up the context menu.
1. Type "Pawn" in the menu's search box, then select **Get Player Pawn** (under **Game**).

1. Connect the **Return Value** output on **Get Player Pawn** to the second input on the **Equals** node.

	Now that we have got a node that will tell us if the Other Actor is the Pawn our player controls, we will use the answer to change the execution flow of our graph. That is, we will direct the execution flow
	as it leaves the On Component Begin Overlap node.

	For that, we want to use a Flow Control node, specifically the **Branch** node. 

1. Drag off of the execution pin on the **OnComponentBeginOverlap** node and release in an empty part of the graph.

	 ![](ExecutionMenu.png)
1. Type "Branch" in the search, then select **Branch** from the context menu.

1. Connect the output pin of the **Equals** node to the input Boolean pin on the **Condition** node.

The graph is now ready for you to set up different behavior to execute depending on whether the overlapping Actor is your Pawn or not. In the next step, we will do just that, and set up Blueprint nodes 
to launch our Character if the result of the **Equals** comparison is **True**.
