Using what you have learned over the course of this Quick Start guide, try to do the following:

* Play a sound when your Character is launched using an [Audio Component](Engine/Components/Audio).
* Create a [variable](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Variables) to store your Launch Velocity, and expose it so you can set it on each copy in the level.
* Add a [Particle System Component](Engine/Components/Rendering#particlesystemcomponent) to your Blueprint and use one of the [Particle Systems](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems) from the **Starter Content**.
* Add an [Arrow Component](Engine/Components/Shapes) and use its rotation to define the direction to launch the character.
* Using [Timelines](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Timelines), add some animation to the Box Mesh to represent it launching the character.
