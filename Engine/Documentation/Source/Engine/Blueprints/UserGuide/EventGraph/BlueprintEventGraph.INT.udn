[/EXCERPT:Intro]

The **EventGraph** of a Level Blueprint contains a node graph that uses events and function calls to perform actions in response 
to gameplay events. This is used to handle events for the level as a whole and to add functionality for specific instances of 
Actors and Blueprints within the world. 

In either case, an **EventGraph** is used by adding one or more events to act as entry points and then connecting Function 
Calls, Flow Control nodes, and Variables to perform the desired actions.

## Working with Graphs

The **Graph** tab displays the visual representation of a particular graph of nodes as it shows all of the nodes contained in the graph as well as the connections between them. It provides editing capabilities for adding and removing nodes, arranging nodes, and creating links between nodes. Breakpoints can also be set in the **Graph** tab to aid in debugging Blueprints. 

See the [](Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/GraphEditor) for a detailed guide to working with the **EventGraph** and other **Graphs** with Blueprints.
