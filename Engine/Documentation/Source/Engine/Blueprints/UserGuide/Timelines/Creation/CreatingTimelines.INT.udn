## Creating Timelines

1. Creating Timelines in Blueprints is extremely simple. In the **Graph** tab, **Right-click** and choose **Add Timeline** from the context menu.

1. A new Timeline node is added to the graph.

Once a Timeline has been added, you will be able to see it listed in the **My Blueprint** tab.

## Timeline Variables

Once you have created a Timeline, you will notice it become available as a variable in the **My Blueprint** tab. This is done to allow for reference to the Timeline component, and is particularly useful when having to utilize the Timeline nodes. These nodes exist to allow for access to certain features of a Timeline, such as its play rate.

In this example, we are using the Get Timeline 0 variable to query the current Play Rate value of that timeline.

A wide variety of such nodes exist, allowing you to query values and control behavior of your Timeline nodes. For a complete list of the available Timeline nodes and their functionality, see the [Timeline nodes page](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide\Timelines\TimelineNodes).

## Renaming Timelines

When using multiple Timelines in your Blueprints, it is important to name each Timeline accordingly. By default, all Timelines are named "Timeline_X" with a serialized number at the end. You can rename a Timeline by **Right-clicking** it within the **Graph** tab or in the **My Blueprint** tab and choosing **Rename**.

## Opening the Timeline Editor 

Of course, creating a Timeline is not useful until you have set it up to do something. To open the **Timeline Editor**, **Double-click** the Timeline node, either in the **Graph** tab or via its listing in the **My Blueprint** tab.

For more information on editing Timelines, please see the [Timeline Editing page](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide\Timelines\Editor).
