## Working with Keys

Each track can have any number of keys that define a time and value. The data is interpolated between these keys to calculate the value at any point during the Timeline. 

### Adding Keys

Keys are added by holding the **Shift** key and clicking in the gray bar.

### Editing Keys

The time and value of the key can be set by clicking on the key and entering the values into the time and value fields near the top of the track.

### Deleting Keys

Selected keys can be deleted by pressing the **Delete** key on the keyboard.

### Moving Keys

To move a key along the timeline, select the key and then click and drag it. Multiple keys can be selected using the **Ctrl** key. Dragging horizontally updates the **Time** value of the key, while dragging vertically updates the **Value**.

### Key Interpolation

By **Right-clicking** on a key, you can choose the interpolation type for a given key.  Key interpolation only affects the 
curve between the key you interpolate for and the next key after that. For example, with all other keys set to **Linear**, and the center key (shown in orange) set to **Cubic-Auto**, this is how the track looks.

The available interpolation types are as follows:

* **Auto**

* **User**

* **Break**

* **Linear**

## External Curves

To the left of the main key area is a field where you can add an external curve asset from the **Content Browser** to that track. This is different than using the ![](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide\Timelines\Editor\add_external_curve_button.png) button, which creates a new
track from a selected external curve.  

|External Curve Icon | Description |
| ---------------- | ----------- |
| ![](external_curve_copy_button.png) | Use the curve selected in the **Content Browser** for this track. |
| ![](external_curve_browse_button.png)| Browse in the **Content Browser** to select a curve for this track. |
| ![](external_curve_internal_button.png)| Convert an imported external curve to an internal curve so that keys and curves can be edited. |

However, you may also **Right-click** on any curve (with at least one key selected) and choose **Create External Curve**. This brings up a context window in which you can edit the path into which the curve asset will be saved. In doing this, you may then use this curve again on other timelines.
