Sometimes it is difficult to tell which type of **Blueprint** you should use at first glance, especially 
when it comes to **Blueprint Macro Libraries** and **Blueprint Classes**. A good rule of thumb is to ask yourself:

* _Are there multiple instances?_

If you will have more than one or two instances (e.g., a TV set that can be shot or turned on/off), 
then it probably makes sense to create a Blueprint Class, with associated code living there. 
If not, and you just want to have some helper functions (like find all Actors within X units), those 
are ideal to live in a Blueprint Macro Library.
