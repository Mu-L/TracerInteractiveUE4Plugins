instance of the Blueprint Class that has been placed in your level.

## Content Browser

[REGION:warning]
Although these two methods involve menus attached to an individual instance of a Blueprint, please note that any changes made in the **Blueprint Editor** are made to the Blueprint asset. 
As a result, the changes will be applied to all instances of the Blueprint.
