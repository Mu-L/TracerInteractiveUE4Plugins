[EXCERPT:Intro]
A **Blueprint Macro Library** is a container that holds a collection of **Macros** or self-contained graphs that can 
be placed as nodes in other Blueprints. These can be time-savers as they can store commonly used sequences of nodes 
complete with inputs and outputs for both execution and data transfer.

Macros are shared among all graphs that reference them, but they are auto-expanded into graphs as if they were a 
collapsed node during compiling. This means that Blueprint Macro Libraries do not need to be compiled. However, changes 
to a Macro are only reflected in graphs that reference that Macro when the Blueprint containing those graphs is 
recompiled.

## Creating a Blueprint Macro Library

Blueprint Macro Libraries are stored in packages and can be created through the **Content Browser** like any other asset.

1. In the **Content Browser**, click on ![New Asset button](button_new_asset_blueprint.png).

1. Select **Blueprints > Blueprint Macro Library** under **Create Advanced Asset** from the menu that appears.

1. Choose a **Parent Class** for your Blueprint Macro Library.

1. Your Blueprint Macro Library will now appear in the **Content Browser**. Type a name for your Blueprint Macro Library under its icon in the **Content Browser**.

	When your Blueprint Macro Library is first created, or when you make changes to it in the **Blueprint Editor**, an asterisk will be added to the Blueprint Macro Library's icon in the **Content Browser**. This indicates that the Blueprint Macro Library is not saved.

1. To save the Blueprint Macro Library directly from the **Content Browser**, click on **Save...** in the **Content Browser's** Navigation Bar.

1. In the **Save Content** window that appears, make sure the checkbox for your new Blueprint Macro Library is selected, then click ![Save Selected](button_save_selected.png).

1. **Double-click** the Blueprint Macro Library's icon to open it in the Blueprint Editor.

[/COMMENT]

There are two other methods by which to access the Blueprint Macro Library Creation menu from the **Content Browser**.

1. **Right-click** in the Asset View (right-hand) panel of the **Content Browser**, or on a folder in the Asset Tree (left-hand) panel of the **Content Browser**. 

1. In the menu that appears, select **Blueprints > Blueprint Macro Library** under **Create Advanced Asset**.

1. The **Pick Parent Class** window will appear, and from this point the Blueprint Macro Library creation process is the same as if you had used the **New Asset** button. 


## Blueprint Macros

### Creating Blueprint Macros

### Building Blueprint Macros

[INCLUDE:Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Macros#BuildingMacros]

### Using Macros stored in Blueprint Macro Libraries

Storing Macros in a Blueprint Macro Library makes them accessible to Blueprint Classes and Level Blueprints throughout your project.  
[INCLUDE:Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Macros#UniversalImplement]

Once the Macro node has been added to the graph, it behaves like any other node and the input and output pins can be wired accordingly. **Double-clicking** on a Macro node in any Blueprint graph
 will open the Macro's graph.
