An **AudioComponent** is used to create and control an instance of sound inside your game. 

## Audio Component

The AudioComponent allows you to add a [Sound Wave](Engine/Audio/WAV) or [Sound Cue](Engine/Audio/Overview#soundcue) as a sub-object to an Actor, providing a sound source. 

For example, say you wanted a particle effect that resembles a fire in your level. While the particle effect alone can be used to convey the visuals of a fire, by adding an AudioComponent as a sub-Actor to it that plays an audio asset of a crackling fire, the fire effect will be that much more convincing. 

You can change several of the properties or settings of the AudioComponent through Blueprints or C++ during runtime such as fading the audio in or out, playing or stopping it entirely, adjusting the volume and other settings which can be found on the [Sound Actors](Engine/Audio/SoundActors) page under the different properties sections.
