## Force Feedback Component

[EXCERPT:WhatIsForceFeedbackComponent]
The Force Feedback Component expands on the standard force feedback implementation by adding the concept of attenuation based on relative location in the world. Like sound or light, the intensity of the force experienced by the player will change with the player's distance from the source, according to a data-defined attenuation setting. The addition of attenuation makes it easy to create effects like explosions that feel more powerful at close range, trains that shake the ground with greater strength when the player is standing right next to the tracks, or even a character's "sixth sense" when passing close by to an object of interest.
