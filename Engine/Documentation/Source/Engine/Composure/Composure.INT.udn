The **Composure** Editor can be used in conjunction with the Sequencer Editor to enable real time compositing of computer generated footage with real world footage much like you would see in movies and tv shows. From being able to match Camera Lens Distortion to being able to determine the difference between foreground and background objects, the Composure Editor works similarly to any other compositing software out there; the major difference is that Composure does everything in real time.

On this page, you will find links to a number of different documents that cover the different aspects of using Composure in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).  If you are new to Composure, it is recommended that you first check out the Composure Quick Start to get a better idea of how Composure can be used in conjunction with Sequencer.
