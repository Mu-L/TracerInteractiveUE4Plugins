For this Quick Start, we are going to be re-creating the third shot that comes with the Composure content sample that you will find on the Epic Games Launcher. However before we can start to do this, we are going to need to download a few additional files, create a new level, and make sure that we have the needed Actors and Blueprints. After completing this section, your project will be ready to start compositing computer generated footage with real world footage.

[region:note]
To fully follow along with this Quick Start you will need to download and create a new UE4 project that uses the Composure sample. You can use the Composure sample on the learn tab of the Epic Games Launcher.

## Steps

1. First, download and extract the following .FBX file which contains the camera animation used for the third shot and nothing else.
*    **[Shot Three Undistorted Camera](https://epicgames.box.com/s/m5of0mecoeia10bqnmppjp8kuydq0fup)**

1. From the Epic Games launcher, make sure you have downloaded and installed the Composure Sample project. If you already have the Composure sample, go ahead and launch it now.

1. Once the Composure sample has loaded go to **Edit** > **Plugins** and then in the **Compositing** section, make sure the **Composure** Plugin is enabled:

    If the Composure Plugin has not been enabled, enabling it will require that you restart the UE4 Editor before you can use them.

1. Next, over in the **Content Browser** create a new folder called **ComposureQS** and then from the Main toolbar go **File** > **New Level** and select the **Empty Level** option. When the level loads, save the new level in the ComposureQS folder with a name of **CQS_Shot_03_Remake**.

1.  Now, locate and open the **Advanced Compositing** map in the Content Browser and double - click on it to open it up.

1. Select the following assets that have been placed in the level and when completed, press **CTRL + C** to copy the assets to the clipboard.

## End Result

With the level lighting now setup and all of the needed Actors added to the level, in the next part of this Quick Start we will take a look at adding and setting up the rest of the needed Actors and Blueprints Composure requires to work.
