In the last section, we created the needed Level Sequence need for Composure to work. In the following section, we will set this Level Sequence up so that it will work with Composure when played.

## Steps

1. First, in the **Sequencer** tab add a new **Camera Cut** track by pressing the green **+Track** button and selecting **Camera Cut** from the displayed list.

    * **BP_AdvancedCompositingSkeletalMesh**
    * **BP_AdvancedCompositing Blueprints**

1. Now, we need to add the following Composure specific inputs  by clicking on the **Plus** icon on the right hand side of the BP_AdvancedCompositing Blueprint and selecting the following items from the list:

    *    **Input 0**
    *    **Input 1**
    *    **Distortion Displacement Map**
		[region:note]
		The Distortion Displacement Map track will look empty after adding the image Sequence due to the Image Plate asset having a frame rate of 0. 
		[/region]
    *    **Overscan Sensor Width**
    *    **Overscan Sensor Height**
    *    **Compositing Mode**
    *    **Shadow Color Grading > Gain**
