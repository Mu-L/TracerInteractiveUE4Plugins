## Automatic VR Editing Mode

As of UE4.13, you can also enter VR Mode Mode automatically. As long as the UE4 Editor is in the foreground and **Enable VR Mode Auto-Entry** mode is enabled when you wear the HMD, you will automatically enter VR Editing Mode. When you remove the HMD, you will leave it.
