### Laser Pointer

Each Controller emits a beam called the "laser pointer" which is used to determine with which Actor you will interact.  The color of the beam indicates the interaction mode the controller is currently in.

| Color | Appearance | Meaning |
| ----- | ---------- | ------- |
| Red |![](standardmode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in the standard interaction mode. This is the default state for the controller. |
| Orange |![](selectionmode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in selection mode, meaning it currently has an Actor selected.  |
| Green |![](movementmode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in movement mode, meaning it is being used to navigate the world. |
| Blue |![](UImode.png)(w:192) | The controller is in UI interaction mode, meaning it is being used to move the UI around. |

##UI in VR

The UI in VR Mode mode enables you to work within the Editor without having to leave VR. Use the controls to bring up the Menu system which gives you access to a variety of settings and Editor windows.  Use the sections below to learn how to call and interact with these systems.

## Interactor Hand

You can change which hand will have the primary laser attached to it by going to **Editor Preferences** > **General** > **VR Mode**. Then under the **General** section change the **Interactor Hand** to either **Left** or **Right**.
