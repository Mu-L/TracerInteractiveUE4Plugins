[EXCERPT:main]
VR Mode enables you to design and build worlds in a virtual reality environment using the full capabilities of the Unreal Editor toolset combined with interaction models designed specifically for Virtual Reality (VR) world building.

Working directly in VR provides the proper sense of scale necessary to create realistic, believable worlds, while the use of motion controllers means you can build environments with natural motions and interactions.
