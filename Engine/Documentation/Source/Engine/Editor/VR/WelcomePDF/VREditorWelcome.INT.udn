**Welcome to the VR Editor!!**

Thanks for downloading our preview of VR Editing in Unreal Engine.  This document will help you get started by downloading the build and introduce you to the basic features of editing in VR.  

Keep in mind this is a very early pre-release build of Unreal Engine 4.12 that should never be used for actual production work.  Saved files may not be compatible with future releases.

Have fun -- and remember to send us feedback and share you ideas with us on the [Unreal Engine forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?99776-Unreal-Editor-in-VR-Official-megathread).

## Configuration

Many aspects of the VR Editor can be configured using the **Console** to better suit your personal preferences for working in VR. Typing `vred` into the console will provide a list of available options, such as the speed at which you teleport from location to location, which can be tweaked to provide the best experience possible.
