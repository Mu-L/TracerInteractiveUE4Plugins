## Moving the World

To move the world around while in the VR Mode you must activate the movement mode by pressing and holding either of the two Controller side buttons. When the side buttons are held in, a grid pattern will be overlaid in the world indicating that you have activated movement mode.

## Scaling the World

You can scale the size of the world up or down to assist you in the placement and manipulation of Actors.

1. Hold the controllers vertically, as close together as possible. 

1. While squeezing the Side Buttons on both controllers, move the controllers as far apart as possible to make the world larger. A line with numbers on top of it tells you the size, in meters, that you currently are in relation to the world.

1. Continue squeezing the Side Buttons on both controllers and move the controllers as close together as possible to make the world smaller.
