HLODs, in their simplest form, combine pre-existing **Static Mesh Actors** into a single **Static Mesh Actor** and material, with atlased textures, to reduce draw calls which in-turn helps with your performance of your game. There is a robust system that enables you to set what needs to be generated when you create these **HLOD Actors**.

## Proxy Meshes

Once your proxy meshes have been generated, you can find them located under the `HLOD` folder generated in your project. This will include the **LODActors** referenced in the **HLOD Outliner**.

These proxy meshes can be opened independently and settings adjusted.

The proxy mesh above contains several different elements that originally all had their own textures that have now been combined into a single texture.


[REGION:note]

This can be problematic for anything using **Mask** or **Opacity**. These alpha channels are not passed to these assets for this merged texture. If opacity or masked items are needed you would want to consider unchecking the option for **Merge Textures**. When doing this the Proxy Mesh will assign the original material as a **Material Element ID** instead of combining.

## HLOD Volume

**The HLOD Volume** is used to manually define/create a HLOD cluster. This volume can be added from the **Modes** panel **Place Mode** and dragged into your level.

Place this volume around **Actors** you want to be grouped into the same cluster. It can be helpful to make this slightly larger than the **Actors** and should not be tightly bounding them. Once you have placed the volume around the **Actors** you can use the option **Generate Clusters** from the HLOD Outliner to create a new cluster with these grouped **Actors**.

### Example

Below is an example of Generated Clusters before and after adding HLOD Volume.

HLOD Level Desired Bound Radius: 500

Drag in the Volume and scale accordingly to cover your **Actors**.

Selecting the generated **LODActor** from the HLOD Outliner shows the cluster created and the Cluster bounds. 

Right-click on the **LODActor** in the HLOD Outliner and click on **Select Contained Actors** to see the **Actors** used for this particular **LODActor** in your scene.

## Details Panel for LODActor

By selecting a **LODActor** in the level you have access to some settings in the Details panel to override some aspects of your generated HLOD along with details to which static meshes have been included with this cluster. This is not unlike any other **Actors** in your scene where you have the option to override or change some values to work within the confines of your design.

We should have a doc that covers the "Simplygon" features of HLOD

## HLODMesh Culling Volume

The HLODMesh Culling Volume is a volume that can be added to a HLOD cluster to remove triangles from source meshes before generating HLOD Mesh.
