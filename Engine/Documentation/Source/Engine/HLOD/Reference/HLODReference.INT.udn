This page details the available right-click context menus and Hierarchical LOD (Level of Detail) Setup menus available in the **Hierarchical LOD Outliner** (HLOD). Below you will find information about accessing these menus and what options
they contain.

[REGION:raw]

To access the HLOD property window, perform the following actions: 

* From the file menu, select **Window** > **Hierarchical LOD Outliner**.

### HLOD Actions

![](InterfaceElements.png)

Below are the descriptions for the three buttons and slider that exist in the **Hierarchical LOD Outliner**.

[REGION:raw]
| --- | :--- |
| **Generate Clusters** | This will generate spherical clusters of **Static Mesh Actors** in the scene that can be grouped. The way this is handled is by using the settings for each LOD settings specified under the LODSystem section of the HLOD Outliner. |
| **Delete Clusters** | This will delete all HLODs that have been previously setup in this level. This includes all generated proxy meshes as well as the clusters that have been setup. This will not wipe the previously set values or properties for the HLOD Levels. |
| **Generate Proxy Meshes** | [INCLUDE:#gpm] |
| **Forced Viewing Level** | This will allow you to force a specific LOD level to be visible in the editor. This is helpful for debugging any LOD issues you may have. |
[/REGION]

### Hierarchical LOD Outliner Context Menus

When you right-click in the Hierarchical LOD Outliner, you will notice a few context menus. Use the table below to find information about accessing these menus and what the options they contain do.

#### LOD Actor Context Menu

Right-click any LOD Actor listed under the **Scene Actor Name** column to bring up this menu where you'll be able to manipulate this specific LODActor.

![](ContextMenu1.png)(w:400)

[REGION:raw]
| Option | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Select LOD Actor** | Selects the LOD Actor in the viewport (same effect as left-clicking the cluster). |
| **Select Contained Actors** | Selects all the Actors contained in the LOD Cluster. |
| **ForceView** | Toggles the view of the HLOD Actor in the viewport. |
| **Rebuild Proxy Mesh** | Forces the right-clicked cluster to rebuild its proxy mesh. |
| **Create Containing Hierarchical Volume** | Creates a Hierarchical Volume around the Actors contained in the Cluster that can then be modified to encompass greater or fewer Actors. |
| **Delete Cluster** | Deletes the right-clicked Cluster. |
[/REGION]

#### Actor Context Menu

Use the arrow next to any LODActor to expand the scene Actors that are included with the generated HLOD cluster. Right-click any Actor in this expanded list to remove or exclude it from the cluster generation.

![](ContextMenu2.png)(w:400)

[REGION:raw]
| Option | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Remove From Cluster** | Removes the right-clicked Actor from the Cluster. |
| **Exclude From Cluster Generation** | Excludes the right-clicked Actor from Cluster generation. If you wish to re-add the excluded Actor click and drag it from the World Outliner into the Cluster in the Hierarchical LOD Outliner. |
[/REGION]

### Properties

Below, broken out by major section, are the properties that can be found in a **Hierarchical LODSetup** in the **LODSystem** panel located in the lower portion of the **Hierarchical LOD Outliner** interface.

### Cluster Generation Settings

The **Cluster Generation** settings enable you to control how HLOD clusters will be generated to include Actors from your levels by setting the desired bounds of your clusters, how full the cluster should be, and the minimum number of Actors that must be used to generate a cluster.

![](cluster.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Desired Bound Radius** | This is not guaranteed but used to calculate filling factor for auto clustering. |
| **Desired Filling Percentage** | This is not guaranteed but used to calculate filling factor for auto clustering. |
| **Min Number of Actors to Build** | Min number of Actors to build LODActor. |
[/REGION]

### Mesh Generation Settings

The **Mesh Generation** settings enable you to control specific properties that will be used when HLOD cluster Actors are merged, like generating lightmaps, combining Materials, transition size, and more.  

![](meshSettings.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | Description |
| --- | :--- |
| **Transition Screen Size** | This is the size on screen (as a radius) that the mesh should reach before swapping to the HLOD Actor. When the parent LOD displays, it won't display any of the children. |
| [REGION:tablesection] Merge Settings [/REGION] ||
| **Generate Light Map UV** | When enabled, this will generate a lightmap UV for the merged mesh and assign the Lightmap Coordinate Index to 1. |
| **Target Light Map Resolution** | The lightmap resolution you'd like to use for the HLOD Actor. |
| **Pivot Point at Zero** | When the merged mesh should have a pivot located a the World Origin (coordinate 0,0,0), or if the pivot should be located at the first Actor listed when generating the HLOD cluster.|
| **Merge Physics Data** |  When enabled, the collision primitives will be merged for the combined Actors. |
| **Merge Materials** | When enabled, the source Materials will be merged into a single flat material. |
| **Material Settings** | The settings here enable you to control how your Materials are packed and combined when the HLOD Actor is generated. [INCLUDE:#materialsettings] |
| **Bake Vertex Data to Mesh** | When enabled, any vertex colors that have been painted on the selected meshes will be incorporated into the generated HLOD Actor and Material that is created. |
| **Use Vertex Data for Baking Material** | When enabled, vertex data will be used when baking out Materials. |
| **Use Texture Binning** | This will calculate the varying output texture sizes according to their importance when packing the final atlas texture. |
| **Use Landscape Culling** | When enabled, landscape geometry can be used to cull away (or remove) any triangle sections of the mesh that are not visible. |
[/REGION]

[COMMENT:none]

[EXCERPT:GPM]
When you generate the proxy meshes this will use the clustered LODs to merge these **Actors** together into a single asset. Depending on what settings you changed for the HLOD levels your static meshes will generate based on this. This can affect your materials, lightmaps, and various other properties as well. 

[REGION:note]
Be aware that this process can take a very long time depending on your scene complexity and settings you've chosen for your HLOD levels.

Texture Sizing Type Description

[REGION:raw]
| Type | Description |
| --- | :--- |	
| **Use TextureSize for all material properties** | Will use the value entered into Texture Size for sizing. |
| **Use automatically biased texture sizes based on TextureSize** | This creates a biased set of {normal:diffuse:otherproperties} textures using the ratio of {1:0.5:0.25} so if the texture size is set to 512 it will output a 512 normal map, 256 diffuse map and 128 map for roughness specular etc (diffuse is clamped to 32x32 and roughness specular etc to 16x16) |
| **Use per property manually overridden texture sizes** | Enables the per texture overrides, and uses those values instead of Texture Size. |
| **Use Simplygonâ€™s automatic texture sizing** | Uses Simplygon's algorithm for texture sizing based on its decimation settings. This should only be used if you are already using Simplygon. |

[EXCERPT:blendmode]
| Selection | Description|
| --- | --- |
| **Opaque** | This blend mode defines a surface through which light neither passes nor penetrates. |
| **Masked** | This blend mode defines the visibility in a binary (on/off) fashion by marking whether areas of the Material should be visible or not. |
| **Translucent** | This blend mode defines the visibility of a Material by using an Opacity value. |
| **Additive** | This blend mode takes the pixels of the Material and adds them to the pixels of the background. |
| **Modulate** | This blend mode multiplies the value of the Material against the pixels of the background. |
| **Alpha Composite (Premultiplied Alpha)** |  This blend mode is used with textures that already have a pre-multiplied alpha. |
