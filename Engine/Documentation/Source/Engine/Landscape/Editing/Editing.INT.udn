After you have created a Landscape, you can now do any of the following to it:

* Modify its shape in [Sculpt](Engine/Landscape\Editing\SculptMode) mode.
* Modify its appearance in [Paint](Engine/Landscape\Editing\PaintMode) mode.
* Change the size, shape, and type of [Brush](Engine/Landscape\Editing\Brushes) you use to modify the Landscape's shape and appearance.
* Modify the size and shape of its components in [Manage](Engine/Landscape\Editing\ManageMode) mode.
* Copy, paste, import, and export parts of the Landscape's heightmap with [Landscape Gizmos](Engine/Landscape\Editing\Gizmos).
* Modify the Landscape's [Material](Engine/Landscape\Materials).
* Create [Splines](Engine/Landscape\Editing\Splines) for any linear features you want to use in your Landscape.
* Create [holes](Engine/Landscape\Materials) in your Landscape for features such as caves.

For information about creating Landscapes, see [](Engine/Landscape\Creation).
