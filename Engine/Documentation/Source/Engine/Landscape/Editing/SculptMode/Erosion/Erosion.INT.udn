The **Erosion** tool uses a thermal erosion simulation to adjust the height of the Landscape heightmap. This simulates the transfer of soil from higher elevations to lower elevations. The 
larger the difference in elevation, the more erosion will occur. This tool also applies a noise effect on top of the erosion, if desired, to provide a more natural random appearance.

In this example, the Erosion tool is being used on the front and back sides of the mountain face. On the front side, the incline is not as steep, so the surface is not eroded as quickly with the 
settings being used. However, on the back side, the incline is much steeper and erodes much more quickly. 


Use the following controls to Sculpt with Erosion for your Landscape heightmap:

| **Controls** | **Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Mouse Button** | Applies erosion values that raises, lowers, or does both to the the heightmap. |

In this example, Erosion uses noise painted onto the hillside to raise or lower the surface giving it variations in different heights based on the strength and various property values used to drive
the erosion being applied.

| **Property** | **Description** |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| **Tool Strength** | Controls how much effect each brush stroke has. |
| **Threshold** | The minimum height difference necessary for the erosion effects to be applied. Smaller values will result in more erosion being applied. |
| **Surface Thickness** | The thickness of the surface for the layer weight erosion effect. |
| **Iterations** | The number of iterations performed. Larger values result in more levels of erosion. |
| **Noise Mode** | Whether to apply noise to raise or lower the heightmap, or do both.  [INCLUDE:#noise] |
| **Noise Scale** | The size of the noise filter used. The noise filter is related to position and scale, which means if you do not change **Noise Scale**, the same filter is applied to the same position many times. |

|Selection | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Both** | This will raise and lower values for all erosion effects applied to the heightmap. |
| **Raise** | This will only apply erosion effects that result in raising the heightmap.  |
| **Lower** | This will only apply erosion effects that result in lower the heightmap.  |
