| **Ramp Width** | Sets the width of the ramp. |
| **Side Falloff** | Sets the edge falloff on the sides of the ramp where it merges inot the rest of the landscape. This falloff gives a softness to the edge flow on these sides. A setting of **0** means no falloff; a setting of **1** means all falloff and no flat surface for the ramp. |
