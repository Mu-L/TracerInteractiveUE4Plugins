The process of sculpting a Landscape involves using one or more tools that modify the underlying heightmap. These tools range from the simple Sculpt tool that paints
height values using a brush and strength scale to many other tools that use complex algorithms to apply interesting effects to the heightmap, such as erosion. Each
tool has a set of properties that determines how the tool affects the Landscape.

## Tool Workflow

Once you've [created your Landscape](Engine/Landscape/Creation), you will have access to the other features of the Landscape tool, like Sculpting by selecting the **Sculpt** mode button.

Once selected, the Sculpt tool options will become available for choosing the type of sculpting tool along with the [brush style and falloff type](engine/landscape/editing/brushes) you'd like to use to apply their effects using strokes to your landscape heightmap.
