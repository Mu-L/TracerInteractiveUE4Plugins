## Creating a New FPS Blueprint Project
Creating a new Landscape is actually a simple process that we will be going over in the next few steps. 
However before we begin to create our Landscape, lets first create a new project **Blueprint First Person** Project. 
If you are unfamiliar with how to create a new project, please check out the following page on how to [Create a New Project](Engine/QuickStart/1) 

## Creating a Landscape
1. First, create a new **Blueprint First Person** project if you have not done so already. 
While you can use other templates for this tutorial, the Blueprint First Person will make it a little easier to inspect your Landscape.

1. Once you have created your new project and the editor has been loaded, create a new level using **File->New Level** and select the **Default** Level from the New Level Template.

1. With your new level now created, select the **Floor** from the level and press the **Delete** key to remove it from the level.

	Make sure that you select your player start and move it up slightly in the Z axis. This will make sure that your player does not start under your newly created Landscape.

	Once completed, you should now have something that looks similar to the following image.

1. Now with the level cleared out and the player start moved up in the Z axis slightly, it is now time to create a new Landscape. To create a new Landscape, click on the Landscape Icon on the **Modes** toolbar.

1. For this tutorial, we will just focus on creating a Landscape using the default settings. 
If you would like to know more about the various settings in the Mange mode of the Landscape tool, please refer to the following document on  [Creating Landscapes](Engine/Landscape/Creation). 
For now, just press the **1: Fill World Button** to make your Landscape Actor fill a majority of the world and then press the **2: Create Button** to actually create the Landscape.
