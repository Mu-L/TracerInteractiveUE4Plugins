With the Landscape material now created, it is now time to apply that Material to the Landscape and begin using the Landscape Paint tools to paint the Landscape. 

## Landscape Painting Prep
Before we can begin painting the Landscape, there are a few things that we have to setup up first. The first thing that we have to do is apply our Landscape Material to the Landscape. This can be done in the following simple steps. 
1. First, find our Material in the **Content Browser**. This should be located under a folder labeled **Materials** that was created in the previous section. When you find it, make sure that you click on it so that it is selected.

1. With the Landscape Material selected in the **Content Browser**, select the Landscape in the world by clicking on it. Then, in the **Details** panel, expand the **Landscape** section and look for the **Landscape Material** input.

1. Apply the Material to the Landscape using the **Use Selected Asset from the Content Browser** arrow icon.

1. When completed, you should have something that looks like the following.

	[REGION:note]
	The black lines that you are seeing in the image above come from having Un-Built lighting on the Landscape. If you re-build your level's lighting, the black lines will go away.

With the Landscape Material now applied, it is almost time to stat painting but before we can do that, we must first create and assign three **Landscape Layer Info Objects**. If you try to paint before you assign the **Landscape Layer Info Objects**, you will get the following warning message.

To fix this, we need to create three **Landscape Layer Info Objects**, one for each Texture that we wish to paint by doing the following. 

1. First, make sure that you are in **Landscape Paint** mode.

	![](T_Landscape_Paint_Mode.png)

1. On the Modes toolbar, under the **Target Layers** section, you should see three inputs labeled **Soil, Grass,** and **Snow**. 

	![](T_Landscape_Target_Layers.png)

1. To the right of the names, there is an icon of a **Plus Sign.** Clicking on the Plus sign icon will bring up another menu that will ask what type of layer you would like to add. For this example, please pick the **Weight-Blended Layer (normal)** option.
	
	![](T_Landscape_Blend_Layer.png)

1. When you select the **Weight-Blended Layer (normal)** option, you will be prompted with a pop-up box that is asking you where you want to save the newly created **Landscape Layer Info Objects**. Select the **Resources** folder that is under the **Landscape folder** and then press the **OK** button.

1. Once you have done that for the first one, repeat the same process for the other two. When completed, you should have something that looks like the following.

Now with the **Landscape Layer Info Objects** created and applied, we can begin to paint our Landscape.

## Painting the Landscape

Before you begin to paint the Landscape, here is a re-cap of some of the most used commonly used keyboard and mouse inputs that you will use when painting the Landscape.
| **Common Controls** | **Operation** |
| --- | --- |
| **Left Mouse Button** | Perform a stroke that applies the selected tool's effects to the selected layer. |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo last stroke. |
| **Ctrl+Y** | Redo last undone stroke. |

The main tool that you will use for actually applying textures to your Landscape is going to be the **Paint Tool**. To find out more about all of the tools that you can use to paint on the Landscape or if you want to know more about how they work, please check out the [Paint Mode](Engine/Landscape/Editing/PaintMode) documentation. 

To apply a Material to the Landscape, hold down the **Left Mouse Button** to apply whatever Material you have selected to the area under the mouse. 

To select a new texture to paint, first make sure you are in **Landscape Painting Mode** then on the **Modes** panel, under the **Target Layers** section, select which texture you want to paint with by clicking on it in the list. Whichever texture is highlighted in orange will be the texture that is painted to the Landscape. In the image below, the **Soil** is what is highlighted in orange so this means that this is the texture that will be painted to the Landscape. To select another texture to be painted, all you have to do is select it in the list and begin painting.

When completed with the painting, you should have something that looks like this.

## Possible Issues and Workarounds

When you first start painting on your Landscape you might run into an issue where the base Material disappears or turns black, like in the following picture: 
[REGION:fullwidth] 
![](T_First_Paint_Issues.png)
[/REGION]
This is happening because there is no Paint Layer data on the Landscape when you first start to paint. To fix this issue, you need to continue to paint over the Landscape generating the Paint Layer data as you go along. If you would like to fill in the entire Landscape, first select a large brush size, like 8192.0, pick a layer that you want to use as a base and paint over the entire Landscape once. This will create Paint Layer data and allow you to continue to paint without anything turning black. 

Another issue that you might run into is that the scale of the Textures that are used on your Landscape are either too big or too small. To fix this, go to your Landscape Material, open it up, and select the **Landscape Coords** node. With that node selected, adjust the **Mapping Scale** and re-compile the Material. Once the Material is re-compiled, check the scale out in the viewport. If the scale is not to your liking, then repeat the processes above until you get the results you want.

 Here is a comparison between a **Mapping Scale** of **0.5** on the Left and **7.0** on the Right.
