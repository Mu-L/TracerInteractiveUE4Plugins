## Level Streaming Scenario
Starting with the main level in the **Sun Temple** project, we have split the level up into the interior space and the end patio with pillars overlooking the ocean.
In the wireframe view below, the teal wireframe shows the persistent interior level, and the yellow wireframe shows the patio level that is going to be streamed in.
The sky and ocean are in the persistent level, as there are a few windows in the main temple that allow the sky and exterior to be seen.

In the interior of the temple, there is a bend in the hallway that hides the patio area from view.

We want to start streaming in the patio level here, so that by the time the player rounds the corner and begins approaching the patio, the streaming level
will be loaded and visible.

As part of the setup, we have two levels, **SunTemple_Persistent** and **SunTemple_Streaming**. Our **Player Start** is in **SunTemple_Persistent**, and our player in the game is 
represented by a _Character_.

1. Open **SunTemple_Persistent** in the **Content Browser**.

1. Move the **Player Start** to the very beginning of the temple.
