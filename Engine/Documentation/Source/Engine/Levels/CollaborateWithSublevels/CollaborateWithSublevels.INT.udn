Levels are binary assets, which can lead to some challenges when collaborating with teammates working on the same area of the project.

However, by setting up **Always Streaming** sublevels, multiple people can work in the same game "space" at the same time. For instance, you might have a sublevel that contains all 
the audio for your scene, as well as a sublevel that contains just the Static Meshes laying out your environment. Each sublevel can still only have one person working on it at a 
time, but with careful segmenting of your scene's Actors, you can minimize overlapping work areas. 

For example, ShooterGame has **Always Streaming** sublevels for audio, collisions, gameplay items, lights, and the surrounding vista environment that the player can see but not interact with.

You can toggle on **Level Coloration** to visualize what Actors in your scene live in which currently loaded level. 

[REGION:tip]
You can even have sublevels' Level Blueprints communicate with each other, so that allows a switch in one sublevel, for instance, to toggle a light in another.

In the [**Levels** window](Engine/Levels/HowTo/WorkWithLevelAssets), just right-click on any Level you want to have always loaded and hover over **Change Streaming Method** in the context menu. Then, click on **Always Loaded**.

[REGION:note]
If your Levels are going to be always visible in game, make sure they are all toggled on in the **Levels** window before rebuilding lighting or navigation.
