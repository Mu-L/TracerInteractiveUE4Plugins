[INCLUDE:Engine/Matinee/HowTo/MHT_1#projectstart]

## Adding the Matinee, Camera and Props

In this step, we will add our **Matinee Actor**, our **Cameras** and a prop that will be our subject for the shots. 

1. From the **Toolbar** menu, select **Matinee** and click the **Add Matinee** button.

1. If the **Matinee** undo warning message appears, click the **Continue** button. 

	![](Engine\Matinee\HowTo\MHT_1\MHT1_MatineeWarning.png)
	
1. The **Matinee Editor** window will open.

	[/REGION]

	_Click for Full View._

1.  Minimize the Matinee window, then from the **Modes** menu under the **Basic** tab, **Drag-and-drop** a **Camera** into the viewport.

	![](MHT_3_Drag_In_Camera.jpg)(w:580)

	_Try to place the **Camera** somewhere to the left of the template text as seen in the image above._

1.  Place two more **Cameras** in the viewport and rotate them inward to face the box as seen in the image below. 

	![](MHT3_All_CamerasPlaced.jpg)(w:580)

	_You can rotate a **Camera** by selecting it and pressing the **E** key, then using the widget to orientate it._
		
1.  From the **Content Browser** under the **Game/Props** folder, locate the **SM_Chair** and **Drag-and-drop** it into the viewport, onto the box. 

	![](MHT3_Drag_In_Chair.jpg)
			
1.  With the chair still selected, press **E** to enter **Rotation Mode** and rotate the chair around to **140.00** as seen below. 

	![](MHT3_ChairRotated.png)
		
## Creating the Camera Sequences in Matinee

In this step, we will assign movement to each **Camera** and hook them up to our **Matinee**. 

1. Open the Matinee window (if you have closed it you can re-open it by selecting the **Matinee**, then from the **Details** panel, selecting **Open Matinee**.). 

	![](MHT3_OpenMatinee.png)

1. With the first **Camera** that was placed in the viewport selected, **Right-Click** in the **Tracks** window and select **Add New Camera Group** from the menu. 

	![](MHT3_AddCameraToMatinee.png)

1. In the **Name Camera Group** box that appears, name the camera **Camera1** and press enter to complete adding the track. 

	![](MHT3_Camera1Added.png)

1. Repeat the process above and add the remaining two cameras to the Matinee. 

	![](MHT3_AllCamerasInMatinee.png)

1. Next, we will increase the length of the Matinee by holding **Control** and dragging the red marker (in the yellow box below) to the **15.00** mark (yellow X). 
	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![](MHT3_Increase_MatineeTime.jpg)
	[/REGION]

1. Click on the first keyframe at **0.00** on the **Movement** track of Camera1 the camera should be selected in the viewport. 
	
	![](MHT3_Camera1KeySelected.png)
	
1. In the Viewport, using the widget, move the camera up and angle it downward slightly (press **E** to enter **Rotation** mode). 

	![](MHT3_Camera1Moved.png)

	_We are going to pan the camera to the right across the template text, so try to angle the camera so that it will view the text._

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the **Time Bar** to the **5.00** mark for the Movement track of Camera1 and press **Enter** to add a new keyframe. 

	![](MHT3_Camera1Key2.png)
	
1. With the second keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and grab the **Green** arrow of the **Translation** widget and move the camera to the right past the text. 
	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![](MHT3_Camera1Done.png)
	[/REGION]

	_You should see a yellow dotted line which indicates the movement the camera will take._

1. Return to the **Matinee** window and click on the first keyframe of the **Movement** track for **Camera2**, then **Control+Drag** the keyframe to the **5.00** mark. 

	![](MHT3_Camera2Key1.png)

1. With **Camera2's** keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and move the camera towards the box (the chair is on) so that its view is filled by the box. 

	![](MHT3_Camera2StartPosition.png)(h:420)

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the **Time Bar** to the **7.50** mark for the Movement track of Camera2 and press **Enter** to add a new keyframe. 

	![](MHT3_Camera2Key2.png)

1. With the new keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and grab the **Blue** arrow of the **Translation** widget, then move the camera upwards to view the chair. 

	![](MHT3_Camera2Finished.png)(h:420)

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the keyframe at **0.00** for the Movement track of **Camera3** to the **7.50** mark. 

	![](MHT3_Camera3Key1.png)

1. With Camera3's keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and move the camera up and slightly hovering over the chair. 

	![](MHT3_Camera3Starting.png)(h:420)

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the **Time Bar** to the **11.00** mark and press **Enter** to add a new keyframe. 

	![](MHT3_Camera3FinalKey.png)

1. With the new keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and move the camera back using the widget to show the chair. 

	![](MHT3_Camera3FinalShot.png)(h:420)

1. Return to the Matinee window and select the **Movement** track of Camera1 then move the **Time Bar** to **11.00** and press **Enter** to add a new keyframe. 
	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![](MHT3_Camera1LastKey1.png)
	[/REGION]

1. With the new keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and click the **Viewport Options** button, then select **Lock Viewport to Actor** and choose **Selected Actor** (your Camera). 

	![](MHT3_LockingViewport.png)

1. Your view should look something like below with a **Lock Icon** located in the upper left corner of the screen. 

	![](MHT3_CameraIsLocked.png)

	_The viewport is now locked to our camera, which is useful for getting more precise angles as well as an idea of what the shot will look like._

1. Using **W, A, S, D**, fly the camera into a position where it is elevated and looking down on the chair. 

	![](MHT3_Camera3InPosition.png)

1. Then return to the Viewport Options window and **Unlock** the camera in the same manner it was locked above. 

	![](MHT3_UnlockCamera.png)

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the **Time Bar** to **15.00** and add a keyframe on the **Movement** track of **Camera1**. 
	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![](MHT3_LastCameraKey.png)
	[/REGION]

1. With the new keyframe still selected, return to the editor viewport and (using the **Translation** widget or by **Locking the Viewport**), move the camera into position as shown below. 

	![](MHT3_CamerasDone.png)

## Creating the Camera Cuts with a Director Track

In this step, we will add a **Director Track** which will handle all of our camera cuts. 

1. Open the Matinee window (if you have closed it you can re-open it by selecting the **Matinee**, then from the **Details** panel, selecting **Open Matinee**.). 

	![](MHT3_OpenMatinee.png)

1. Under Camera3, **Right-Click** in an empty space in the **Tracks** window and from the context menu select **Add New Director Group**. 

	![](MHT3_AddDirectorGroup.png)

1. Move the **Time Bar** back to **0.00** (if it is not already there) and click on the **Director** track then press **Enter** to add a keyframe. 

1. The **Cut To Group** pop-up window will appear, go ahead and press **Ok** for **Camera1** to finish adding the keyframe. 
	
	![](MHT3_FirstCutAdded.png)(w:740)

	_A bar will be added for **Camera1** indicating that it will be used for the 15 second sequence, which we will change to include the other cameras._

1. Move the **Time Bar** to **5.00**, **7.50** and **11.00** and add a keyframe at each, cutting to **Camera2**, **Camera3**, and back to **Camera1** respectively (see below). 
	[REGION:lightbox]
	[![](MHT3_FinishedMatinee.png)(w:780)](MHT3_FinishedMatinee.png)
	[/REGION]

	_Click image for full view._

1. **Close** the Matinee window, then select the **Matinee** in the **World Outliner** and in the Details panel, check the following options: **Play on Level Load**, **Looping**, **Disable Movement Input**, **Disable Look at Input**, and **Hide Player**. 
	
	![](MHT3_CutToGroup.png)
	![](MHT3_MatineeActorSettings.png)

1. From the main toolbar, click **Build** (optional to build the lighting in the level) then click the **Play** button. 

	![](MHT3_BuildAndPlay.png)

1. You should now have a Matinee sequence that starts when the level loads and cycles through three different cameras.
