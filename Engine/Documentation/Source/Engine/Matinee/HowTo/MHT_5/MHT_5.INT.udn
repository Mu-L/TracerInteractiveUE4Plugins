## Adjust Movement and Intensity

In this step, we will set up movement for the light and adjust its intensity. 

1. In Matinee on the Movement track, click on the second keyframe (at **2.00**) then minimize Matinee and move the light to the center of the hallway.

	_This will increase the intensity of the light, making it brighter, as it moves to the center of the hallway._

1. **Right-click** on the second keyframe of the **Attenuation Radius** track (at **2.00**) and Set Value to **250**, do the same for the fourth keyframe (at **6.00**).
