## Add the Matinee Actor and Props

In this step, we will add our **Matinee Actor**, a **Skeletal Mesh Actor** and create a platform for the character to jump up on.  

1. From the **Toolbar** menu, select **Matinee** and click the **Add Matinee** button.

	_Your box should look something like this:_

## Add Actor to Matinee and Add Tracks

In this step, we will add the **SK_Mannequin** to the **Matinee** and add the tracks we will be using for the sequence. 

1.  Select the **MatineActor** from the World Outliner, then click the **Open Matinee** button. 

	![](MHT7_OpenMatineeActor.png)

1.  Minimize the Matinee, then select the **SK_Mannequin** and re-open Matinee, then **Right-click** in the tracks window and select **Add New Skeletal Group**.

	_Give the new group a name, in this example we are calling it **SK_Mannequin**._

1.  **Right-click** on the **Group Name** and select **Add New Sound Track** from the menu. 

	![](MHT7_AddNewSoundTrack.png)

1.  **Repeat the previous step** to add another **Sound Track** so that there are two. 

1.  Grab the ending marker at **5.00** and move it to the **12.00** mark to increase the length of the Matinee.

## Adding Movement and Animation

In this step, we will setup the movement and animation for our character which will jump to the top of the box. 

1.  With Matinee open, click on the Movement track then move the **Time Bar** to **3.00** and press **Enter** to add a keyframe. 

	![](MHT7_MovementKey2.png)

1.  **Repeat the step above** to add keyframes at **4.50**, **6.00**, **7.00**, and **8.00**. 

	![](MHT7_MovementKeysAdded.png)

1.  Click on the second keyframe of the Movement track, minimize Matinee, then in the Details panel for SK_Mannequin set the **Location** of **Z** to **135**. 

	![](MHT7_MoveDetailsKey2.png)

1.  Return to Matinee, click on the third keyframe for Movement, minimize Matinee and set the **Location** of **Y** to **-674** and **Z** to **385**. 

	![](MHT7_MoveDetailsKey3.png)

1.  Return to Matinee, click on the fourth keyframe for Movement, minimize Matinee and set the **Location** of **Y** to **-622.53** and **Z** to **804.640**. 

	![](MHT7_MoveDetailsKey4.png)

1.  Return to Matinee, click on the fifth keyframe for Movement, minimize Matinee and set the **Location** of **Y** to **-561.0** and **Z** to **872.0**. 

	![](MHT7_MoveDetailsKey5.png)

1.  Return to Matinee, click on the sixth keyframe for Movement, minimize Matinee and set the **Location** of **Y** to **-502.0** and **Z** to **847.0**. 

	![](MHT7_MoveDetailsKey6.png)

1.  With the final keyframe in the **Movement** track still selected in the level viewport, the **SK_Mannequin** Actor should be standing on the top of the platform. 

	![](IdleOnTop.jpg)

	_If your Actor is not standing on top of the platform, you can move him (and adjust the snapping size in the box above) so that he is standing on it._

1.  Move the **Time Bar** back to **0.00**, select the Anim track and press **Enter** to add a keyframe, then select **Idle** from the menu that appears. 

	![](MHT7_AnimKey1.png)

	_If you look in the level viewport, the **SK_Mannequin** Actor will now be in an **Idle** pose since we have specified the animation to use to start the **Matinee**._ 

1.  Move the **Time Bar** to **2.50** and press **Enter**, then select **Jump_Start** from the menu. 

1. **Right-click** on the **Jump_Start** keyframe at **2.50** and select **Set Play Rate** and set the value to **0.23**. 

	![](MHT7_JumpAnimAdded.png)

1. Move the Time Bar to **4.50** and press **Enter**, then select **Jump_Start** again from the menu. 

	![](MHT7_AnimKey3.png)

	_We could have added the **Jump_Loop** animation, however our character is going to continue ascending and using frames from the **Jump_Start** will look better._

1. **Right-click** on the **Jump_Start** keyframe at **4.50** and select **Set Start Offset** and set this to **5**. 

	![](MHT7_AnimKey4.png)

	_By doing this, we have stated that we want this animation to start off at frame 5 instead of frame 0._

	![](JumpStart.jpg)(w:720)

	_You should also see that the pose on the character has changed and is not using the normal Jump_Start pose of the character crouching._

1. Move the Time Bar to **8.00** and press **Enter**, then select **Jump_End** from the menu. 

1. Scrub the Time Bar to **8.30** and press **Enter**, then select **Idle** from the menu. 

	![](MHT7_AnimKey6.png)

1. **Right-click** on the **Idle** keyframe at **8.30** and choose **Set Time** and set it to **8.20**. 

1. **Right-click** on the **Idle** keyframe that was moved to **8.20** and choose **Set Looping**. 

	![](MHT7_AnimKey7.png)

	_The darker section at the end of the sequence indicates that the animation is set to loop._

## Adding Sounds and Finishing Matinee

In this step, we will add sounds using the sound tracks and finish up the sequence. 

1. Minimize the Matinee window, then in the Content Browser inside the **Game/Audio** folder, click on the **Explosion01** asset. 

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the Time Bar to the **2.50** mark and press **Enter**. 

	![](MHT7_Sound1.png)(w:780)

	_In order to add a sound asset to the **Sound Track**, a **Sound Wave** or **Sound Cue** asset must be selected in the **Content Browser**._

1. **Right-click** on the newly added sound asset's keyframe and select **Set Sound Volume** and set it to **1.5**. 

1. **Repeat the previous step**, however **Right-click** and select **Set Sound Pitch** and set it to **0.5**. 

	![](MHT7_Sound2.png)

	_You will see that the volume for this sound has been increased to 1.5 while the pitch has been decreased to 0.5 on the bar in the track._

1. Click on the other **Sound Track**, then in the **Content Browser** under **Game/Audio**, select the **Start_Music_Cue** asset. 

1. Return to the Matinee window and move the Time Bar back to **0.00** and press **Enter** to add the music. 

	![](MHT7_Sound3.png)(w:780)

1. In the **Details** panel for the Sound Track with the music, check the **Continue Sound on Matinee End** checkbox. 

	![](MHT7_Sound4.png)

	_This will allow the music to continue playing once the 12 second **Matinee** sequence is over (otherwise the music would abruptly end)._ 

1. Close the Matinee, then select the **MatineeActor** in the **World Outliner**. 

1. In the **Details** panel under Play, check the **Play on Level Load** checkbox. 

	![](MHT7_MatineeFinished.png)

1. Click the **Play** button from the main toolbar to play in the editor.

	_You should now see that the **SK_Mannequin** Actor will jump to the top of the box, along with an explosion sound effect and music playing._

	_You could apply a **Director Track** with multiple camera angles, FOVs, Post Processing effects, or a Slow-mo track to polish it up and make it your own._
