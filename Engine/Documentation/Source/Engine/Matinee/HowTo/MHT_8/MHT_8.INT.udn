	_Click for Full View._

1.  Minimize the Matinee and in the **Content Browser** under the **Game/Props** folder, **Right-click** on the **SM_Rock** and select **Create Destructible Mesh**.

1.  The **Destructible Mesh** window will open, click the **Fracture Mesh** button from the tool bar. 

	![](MHT8_FractureMesh.png)(w:720)

1.  Under **Destructible Settings**, expand **Fracture Effects** and **0**, then under **Particle System** click the drop-down menu and select **P_Explosion**.

1.  In the same section, click the **Sound** drop-down menu and select the **Explosion01** asset. 

	![](MHT8_AssignSound.png)

1.  Click the **Save** button from the tool bar then close the window. 

1.  In the **Content Browser**, drag the **SM_Rock_DM** asset into the level. 

	![](MHT8_DragRockIn.png)

1.  In the **Content Browser** under **Game/Particles**, drag-and-drop the **P_Fire** effect into the level, inside the rock. 

	![](MHT8_AddFire.png)

1.  In the **Details** panel for **P_Fire**, scroll down and find the **Activation** section and **un-check Auto Activate**. 

	![](MHT8_UncheckAutoActivate.png)

	_This will keep the asset in the level, but not activate it until we tell it to which we will do through **Matinee**._

1.	Select the **TextRenderActor** text and move it to the little box as shown below (press the **E** key to enter rotation mode and rotate it forward). 

	![](MHT8_MoveTemplateText.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the TextRenderActor, under the **Text** section, in the Text field replace the text with **3**. 

	![](MHT8_3.png)

	_This is going to serve as our timer and countdown to the explosion we will trigger._

1.	Also, inside the **Details** panel make a note of what the **Location** values are under **Transform** for the text as we will need them in a moment. 

	![](MHT8_TextLocation.png)

1.	In the level viewport with the text still selected, press **Control+W** to duplicate the **Text Render** Actor. 

1.	Inside the **Details** panel for the new Text Render Actor, set **Location** to the same as the other Text Render Actor and set the **Text** to **2**. 

	![](MHT8_2.png)

1.	**Repeat the previous two steps** to create another Text Render Actor. Set it in the same location as the others and set the text to **1**. 

1.	For each of the Text Render Actors in the Details panel under **Rendering**, check the box for **Actor Hidden In Game**. 

	![](MHT8_ActorHiddenInGame.png)

	_We will control the visibility of the Actors through Matinee and what them hidden by default._

## Adding the Assets to Matinee and Setting the Tracks

In this step, we will add all of our assets to our **Matinee** and define the tracks that will be used to drive the sequence. 

1.  **Select** the Matinee in the **World Outliner** or viewport, then in the Details panel **select Open Matinee** and minimize it when it opens. 

1.  **Select** the rock in the viewport, then back in Matinee in the **Tracks Window**, **Right-click** and **select Add New Empty Group**. 

	![](MHT8_AddEmptyGroup.png)

	_Give the new group a name when prompted, in this example we are simply calling it the **Rock** group._

1.  **Right-click** on the group and select **Add New Event Track** from the context menu. 

	![](MHT8_AddEventTrack.png)

1.  With the Event Track selected, move the **Time Bar** to **4.00** and press **Enter** to add a keyframe, then name the event **Explode**.

	![](MHT8_EventTrackComplete.png)

1.  **Right-click** on the red ending marker at **5.00** and **choose Move To Longest Track Endpoint** to shorten the sequence to **4.00**. 

	![](MHT8_SetLength.png)

1.  Minimize Matinee and select the **Text Render** Actor who is set to **3** in the World Outliner. 

1.	Back in Matinee in the Tracks Window, **Right-click** and select **Add New Empty Group** and name the group something like **Text-3**. 

	![](MHT8_Text3Added.png)

1.	**Right-click** on the group and select **Add New Visibility Track**. 

	![](MHT8_AddNewVisTrack.png)

1.	**Repeat the previous two steps** and create two new groups (**Text-2** and **Text-1**), both with **Visibility** tracks. 

	![](MHT8_MatineeSetupComplete.png)

1.	Click on the Visibility track for **Track-3**, move the Time Bar to **1.00** and press **Enter**, then select Show from the pop-up menu to add a keyframe. 

	![](MHT8_Show3.png)

1.	Move the Time Bar to **2.00** and press **Enter** and select **Hide** from the pop-up menu. 

	![](MHT8_Hide3.png)

	_A bar will be created between **1.00** and **2.00** which indicates when the text **3** will be shown, which is for 1 second._

1.	Repeat the previous two steps to Show/Hide the text **2** from **2.00** to **3.00** and the text **1** from **3.00** to **4.00**, then close the Matinee.

## Using the Matinee Actor in Blueprints

In this step, we wll trigger an event when the **Explode** event is called in our **Matinee** sequence and activate the particle effect when the **Matinee** is complete.

1.	Select the **MatineeActor** in the level viewport or World Outliner then click the **Blueprints** button from the main tool bar and select **Open Level Blueprint**.

1.	Minimize the **Level Blueprint** and select the rock in the level, then back in the Level Blueprint, **Right-click** in the graph and choose **Add Reference to SM_Rock_DM**. 

	![](MHT8_AddReferenceToRock.png)

1.	Minimize the Level Blueprint again and select the **P_Fire** asset, then back in the Level Blueprint, **Right-click** and choose **Add Reference to P_Fire**.

	![](MHT8_ReferencesAdded.png)

1.	Left-click on and drag off the out pin of the **SM_Rock_DM** node and in the window that appears, enter the text **Apply** then click **Apply Radius Damage**. 

	![](MHT8_ApplyRadiusDamage.png)

1.	Left-click on and drag off the **Explode** out pin for the **MatineeActor** and connect it to the in pin of the Apply Radius Damage node, then set each of the float values to **12000**. 

	![](MHT8_ExplodeComplete.png)

1.	Left-click on and drag off the out pin of the **SM_Rock_DM** node and in the window that appears, enter the text **Location** and choose **Get Actor Location**.

1.	Left-click on and drag off the out pin of the **P_Fire** node and in the window that appears, enter the text Activate and choose the **Activate** option. 

	![](MHT8_ActivateNode.png)
