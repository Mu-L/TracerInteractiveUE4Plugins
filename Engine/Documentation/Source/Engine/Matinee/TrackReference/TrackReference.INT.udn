Version: 4.9

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]


Matinee provides many built-in **Track Types** that allow for animating different types of data on various types of _Actors_. 
Through the use of _Tracks_ you can dictate movement of _Actors_ around in a scene, fire off events in _Blueprints_, adjust color or material properties of an _Actor_, as well as several other elements which are covered on this page. 


## Movement Track
One of the most important _Track_ classes is the **Movement Track** which is used to move an _Actor_ around in the scene over time. A prime example of this would be to 
generate a path for an _Actor_ to follow. Creating a path is simply a matter of selecting the _Movement Track_ you want to modify and doing the following:

* Scrub to the time when you want to add the new keyframe.
* **Press** the **Enter** key or the **Add Key** button to create a new keyframe at that time.
* **Move** the _Actor_ to the desired position for that frame.
* **Repeat this for each keyframe** and desired position in order to create your path. 

It is a very good idea to create an initial keyframe for the _Actor_ at its initial position at level load and then not move that keyframe. 
Otherwise you may see a "pop" when playback begins as the _Actor_ moves to the position proscribed by the animation data.

[REGION:fullwidth]
![move_3dpath.png](move_3dpath.png)
[/REGION] 

You will see the path of the _Actor_ in the 3D viewport. Paths are drawn in yellow when the _Group_ is selected and are set to the _Editor Group_ color when unselected. 
You can **Left-click** on the large keys (larger boxes) in the 3D viewport to select a key and allow you to edit it in the same way as you would select them 
in the main _Matinee_ window. The smaller boxes (or Ticks) indicate 0.1 second intervals, and so give you an idea of the speed of the object.

When a keyframe is selected, you will see green handles in the level viewports which allow you to control the velocity at that key and reshape the curve. 
By default the interpolation mode between keyframes is a curve, but you can change the interpolation mode by **Right-clicking** on a key in the main _Matinee_ window 
and using the **Interp Mode** menu. 

![interp_mode_menu.png](interp_mode_menu.png)

[REGION:note]
The color of the keyframe triangle in the _Matinee_ window will indicate the current interpolation mode it is using. 
[/REGION]

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the **Details** panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Active Condition | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| Ang Curve Tension | Controls the tightness of the curve for the rotation path. |
| Disable Movement | Allows you to disable this _Movement Track_ in preview; useful when keyframing _Actors_ relative to another _Actor_. |
| Hide 3D Track | Toggles display of the track's 3D movement path in the viewport. |
| Lin Curve Tension | Controls the tightness of the curve for the translation path. |
| Rot Mode | Allows you to choose the method for determining the rotation of the controlled _Actor_. |
| Show Arrow At Keys | Displays an arrow at each keyframe to allow you to see the orientation at each keyframe. |
| Show Rotation On Curve Ed | If _false_, when this track is displayed on the Curve Editor in _Matinee_, do not show the Rotation tracks. |
| Show Translation On Curve Ed | If _false_, when this track is displayed on the Curve Editor in _Matinee_, do not show the Translation tracks. |
| Use Quat Interpolation | Use a _Quaternion_ linear interpolation between keys. |

[REGION:tip]
Refer to [](Engine\Matinee\HowTo\MHT_1) and [](Engine\Matinee\HowTo\MHT_2) for examples of using the Movement Track to move Actors in a scene.

### Rotation Interpolation
_Matinee_ uses two different rotation interpolation schemes to rotate _Actors_ between keyframes: **Euler** and **Quaternion**.

* _Euler_ - This is the default and works by interpolating the Yaw, Pitch, and Roll of the _Actor_ between the values at keyframes. This allows you to edit the 3 curves for orientation over time in the Curve Editor and control ease-in/ease-out between keyframes. It also supports winding - that is, if you rotate an object multiple times around, the keyframe will store the number of complete revolutions instead of throwing it away. This makes it easy to keyframe something like a screw going into a wall, and also gives you complete control over which direction an _Actor_ takes when moving between two orientations.

* _Quaternion_ - This method of interpolation does not support winding, and is essentially linear between keyframes with no support for ease in/out. However, it is more robust and will always find the "shortest" route between two different orientations.

You can control which method is being used by toggling the **Use Quat Interpolation** setting from the Details panel.  


### Rotation Modes
There are two different Rotation modes in _Matinee_: **Keyframed** and **Look At Group**.

* _Keyframed_ - is the default, where the orientation of the _Actor_ is determined by keyframes.
* _Look At Group_ - specifies that you want the _Actor_ to always point at the _Actor_ controlled by another _Group_. 

_Look At Group_ is useful when using a camera, as you can have it always look at a particular target wherever it moves. To use _Look At Group_ as the Rotation Mode, type into the **LookAtGroupName** field the name of the _Group_ you wish the _Actor_ to point at, and set the **RotMode** setting to **IMR_LookAtGroup**.


### Movement Relative To Other Groups
It is possible to have a _Movement Track_ keyframe lookup its transformation info from another _Group_ in the same _Matinee_ sequence.  
This means that a keyframe can point to a moving object and have the _Movement Track_ interpolate to that position.  
An example usage case of this would be animating a projectile that always hits a character moving in a non-predictable fashion.

To setup a keyframe to lookup its position from another _Group_, **Right-click** on the keyframe and choose **Select Transform Lookup Group...**.

![lookup_track1.png](lookup_track1.png)

This will show a dialog that lets you choose a _Group_ to lookup transform information from.

![lookup_track2.png](lookup_track2.png)

After selecting a _Group_, the keyframe will have the lookup _Group's_ name displayed above it.  
The image below displays 4 key frames that are using the _Group's_ **Box1** and **Box2** to lookup their positioning info.

[REGION:fullwidth]
![lookup_track3.png](lookup_track3.png)
[/REGION] 

To clear a lookup _Group_ for a keyframe, **Right-click** on the keyframe and choose **Clear Transform Lookup Group**.

![lookup_track4.png](lookup_track4.png)


### Separating Translation and Rotation
It is possible to "split" a _Movement Track's_ translation and rotation components so they can be keyframed individually on each axis.  
This allows finer control over _Movement Track_ curves.  Splitting a _Movement Track_ is an opt-in process.  
Initially, all _Movement Tracks_ are combined which means translation and rotation curves have the same number of keyframes and all keyframes exist at the same location in time.  

To split a _Movement Track_, simply select **Split Translation and Rotation** from the context menu when **Right-clicking** on a _Movement Track_.

![MoveTrackMenu.png](MoveTrackMenu.png)

Once you split a _Movement Track_, it will look like this:

[REGION:fullwidth]
![SplitMoveTrack.png](SplitMoveTrack.png)
[/REGION] 

Each axis operates like a unique _Track_ so you can have any number of keyframes in them.

Translation and rotation components are grouped and can be collapsed when not in use.  The vertical bars drawn adjacent to the translation and rotation groups represent 
a keyframe in one or more of the axes.  Selecting a vertical bar will select all keyframes below it.  This allows you to select multiple keyframes at once.  

[REGION:note]
Quaternion interpolation mode cannot be used when translation and rotation are separated.
[/REGION]


### Normalize Velocity 
When working with Bezier curves, it is often possible to create situations where objects traveling along a curve speed up or slow down depending on the shape and spacing of 
keyframes.  The **Normalize Velocity** option modifies a _Movement Track's_ translation curves in order to make objects traveling along it move at constant velocity.  
It is important to understand that constant velocity uses the 3D path that your _Movement Track_ curves generate.  When normalize velocity is used, the 2D curves for each axis 
of translation may change shape but the 3D path that it generates should not change from the original path.  

_Normalize Velocity_ does not force a curve into constant velocity after the menu option is selected.  
It simply does a one time adjustment by examining the original curves and modifying them to maintain constant velocity.  
Any subsequent changes to the curve may cause it to no longer have constant velocity. _Normalize Velocity_ is also only available on _Movement Tracks_ which 
have translation and rotation separated (see _Separating Translation and Rotation_ above).  

It is possible to _Normalize Velocity_ on segments of a curve rather than the full interval. When this happens, the _Normalize Velocity_ routine adds a keyframe 
right before and right after the section being normalized. This is done so that the parts of the curve not being normalized remain intact. You may notice "jerky" movements 
during playback when an object traveling along the curve transitions to and from the _Normalized Velocity_ section.  To fix this, you will have to manually adjust the keyframes 
before and after the normalized segment.



## The Director Group
The **Director Group** is a special type of group that does not work on an arbitrary _Actor_ in the scene like a normal _Actor_, but implicitly works with the "Player". 
It is used when you want your sequence to be a cinematic, and you want to take control of the players view.

You can add a _Director Group_ to your _Matinee_ sequence in the same way as a regular group, but choose **Add New Director Group** instead. The _Director Group_ header is 
a different color from a regular group header to make it easier to find. 

The _Director Group_ has a set of unique _Track Types_ that can be added which are outlined below. 


### Director Track
The **Director Track** allows you to attach the players view to different _Actors_ as the sequence proceeds. When you add a new keyframe to the _Director Track_, a combo box 
will allow you to choose which _Group_ to assign the view to at that point. 

Colored bars on the _Director Track_ allow you to see which _Group_ the camera is viewing through at each point in the sequence - the color corresponds to the _Editor Group_ 
color of each group. 

If you want to return the camera to the player, simply add a cut back to the _Director Group_ itself (think of the _Director Group_ as a special group relating to the "Player"). 
At the end of the sequence, the view will automatically return to the player so a cut back to the _Director Group_ is not necessary.

![dir_track.png](dir_track.png)


#### Shots
_Director Tracks_ are broken up into named **Shots**, just as you would encounter in standard film-making. Each key denotes a new shot and the shot lasts for the duration of 
that key.

![shot_label.png](shot_label.png)

By default, shots are numbered according to their position in the timeline. Adding a new key between two existing keys will cause the shot associated with the new key to be 
numbered between the existing shots.

**Existing keys:**
[REGION:fullwidth]
![shot_before.png](shot_before.png)
[/REGION] 

**After adding new key:**
[REGION:fullwidth]
![shot_after.png](shot_after.png)
[/REGION] 

Shots can be renamed through the context menu.

1. The existing shot name:   
    ![shot_label.png](shot_label.png)
1. Select the **key** the shot is associated with, **Right-click** on it, and choose **Rename** in the context menu.   
    ![track_menu.png](track_menu.png)
1. Enter a new number for the shot in the **Set Camera Shot Number** dialog:   
    ![shot_dialog.png](shot_dialog.png)
1. The shot is now renamed:   
    ![shot_renamed.png](shot_renamed.png)


### Fade Track
To control fading of the scene to a particular color, you can use a **Fade Track**. In order to control the amount of fading over time, 
you must use the [Curve Editor](Engine/UI/CurveEditor). When the Fade amount is 0.0, there is no fading, and when its 1.0, the scene is completely faded out.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Active Condition | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| Curve Tension | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| Persist Fade | Enables and Disables the _Fade Track._ |

### Slomo Track
One special effect you can apply to a cinematic is to slow down the game speed by using a **Slomo Track**. This _Track_ works similarly to the _Fade Track_ where you 
use the [Curve Editor](Engine/UI/CurveEditor) to modify the slow-motion over time. A Slomo factor of 1.0 will use the default game speed, a lower number will reduce game 
speed and a higher number will speed up the game.

Slomo affects all game actions, physics, particles, etc. as well as the speed of the sequence itself. 

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Active Condition | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| Curve Tension | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |


### Audio Master Track
The **Audio Master Track** gives control over the overall volume and pitch of the game's audio. When an _Audio Master Track_ is added to the _Director Group_, it has 
one default key at the beginning of the sequence whose **InterpMode** is Linear. Adding new keys allows you to modify the volume and/or pitch over the course of the sequence.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Active Condition | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| Curve Tension | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |


### Color Scale Track
The **Color Scale Track** modifies the color scale of the rendered scene output, allowing you to tint the scene.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| Active Condition | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| Curve Tension | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |


## Property Tracks
**Property Tracks** consist of several different _Track Types_ and contain a variable inside the _Actor_ the _Track_ is attached to. 
You can set new variable values for a _Property Track_ by **Right-clicking** on a keyframe and choosing the **Set** action that corresponds to the _Track Type_ selected. 

Before a _Property Track _ can be added to _Matinee_ however, it must first be "exposed" so that _Matinee_ can affect it. 

### Exposing Tracks To Matinee
Exposing a variable to _Matinee_ can be accomplished by selecting the **Expose to Matinee** checkbox inside the Details panel of the _Blueprint_ the variable resides in, 
as pictured below. 

![Expose_ToMatinee.png](Expose_ToMatinee.png)

Once you have compiled your _Blueprint_, the variable type can be used as a _Track Type_ in _Matinee_. 

[REGION:note]
To expose a variable in code, simply add `Interp` as a keyword in the [`UPROPERTY()` macro](Programming\UnrealArchitecture\Reference\Properties). 
[/REGION]

While most _Tracks_ can be added and worked with instantly, the following _Track Types_ are required to be exposed to _Matinee_ (or through code) in order to work with them.  


### Bool Property Track
The **Bool Property Track** provides control over a boolean variable in the _Actor_ connected to the group containing the _Track_. When adding the _Track_, a dialog will 
appear allowing you to choose from all boolean variables that are connected to the _Actor_ that can be controlled by _Matinee_.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Property Name** | Read-only variable indicating the name of the property in the connected _Actor_ which this track will modify over time. |


### Float Property Track
The **Float Property Track** allows you to modify the value of a floating-point property of an _Actor_ over time, such as Brightness for a light, or _DrawScale_ for a _StaticMesh Actor_. When you create the _Track_, it will bring up a combo box showing all modifiable properties of that Group's Actor. Select the one you want and then add/modify keyframes in the same way as you would for a _Movement Track_. You can also use the [CurveEditor](Engine/UI/CurveEditor) to adjust the value of the parameter over time.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Property Name** | Read-only variable indicating the name of the property in the connected _Actor_ which this track will modify over time. |


### Vector Property Track
The **Vector Property Track** allows you to modify the value of a Vector property of an _Actor_ over time, such as _DrawScale3D_ for a _StaticMesh Actor_. When you create 
the _Track_, it will bring up a combo box showing all modifiable properties of that Group's _Actor_. Select the one you want and then add/modify keyframes in the same way as 
you would for a _Movement Track_. You can also use the [CurveEditor](Engine/UI/CurveEditor) to adjust the values of the parameter over time.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Property Name** | Read-only variable indicating the name of the property in the connected _Actor_ which this track will modify over time.|


### LinearColor Property Track
The **LinearColor Property Track** is used to modify a linear color variable in the attached _Actor_. 
For example, if you have a _Light Component_ as part of a _Blueprint_, you can assign a linear color variable as the light's color and can then change it using this type of track. 
The components of a linear color take values in the range 0 to 1 (or higher to overdrive the component).

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Property Name** | Read-only variable indicating the name of the property in the connected _Actor_ which this track will modify over time. |


### Color Property Track
The **Color Property Track** is used to control a byte-based Color variable in the attached _Actor_. 
For example, unlike the **LinearColor Property Track,** if you were to place a _Light Actor_ directly inside a level, you would then be able to adjust the **Light Color** 
property via this type of track. 

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Property Name** | Read-only variable indicating the name of the property in the connected _Actor_ which this track will modify over time. |



## Material Parameter Tracks
There are two **Material Parameter Tracks** that can be driven by _Matinee_: **Float Material Parameter** and **Vector Material Parameter**. 


### Float Material Parameter Track
The **Float Material Parameter Track** is used to modify Scalar Parameters within materials during runtime. The _Track_ takes a list of materials and modifies the value 
of the given parameter in those materials.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Target Materials** | List of materials whose parameters will be modified and references to those materials that need to be given _MaterialInstanceConstants_ in the level, compiled at save time.  |
| **Param Name** | Name of the parameter in the materials to modify. |

### Vector Material Parameter Track
The **Vector Material Parameter Track** is used to modify Vector Parameters within materials during runtime. The _Track_ takes a list of materials and modifies the value of the 
given parameter in those materials.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Materials** | List of materials whose parameters will be modified and references to those materials that need to be given _MaterialInstanceConstants_ in the level, compiled at save time. |
| **Param Name** | Name of the parameter in the materials to modify. |


## Particle Tracks
There are two **Particle Tracks** that can be driven by _Matinee_: **Float Particle Parameter Track** and **Particle Replay Track**. 

### Float Particle Parameter Track
The **Float Particle Parameter Track** is used to modify parameter distributions within particle systems during runtime. Any parameters with the given parameter name in 
the particle system connected to the group containing the _Track_ will be modified. This means you could have a fire particle system with emitters for the flames, sparks, 
and smoke where each emitter has a parameter controlling the spawn rate named _SpawnRate_. A single _Float Particle Param Track_ could drive all of these parameters to control 
the fire.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Param Name** | Name of the parameter in the particle system to modify. |


### Particle Replay Track
The **Particle Replay track** allows you to create and play back pre-recorded particle simulations. This is especially useful when you want the particle to behave the same 
way in all shots. When you add a new key to the _Particle Replay Track_, you are essentially adding a new clip to record to. For each clip, a bar is displayed on the timeline 
showing the duration of the clip.

![replay_bar.png](replay_bar.png)

When selected, you have the ability to adjust the starting point and duration of the clip using the handles on either end of the clip's bar in the timeline. **Left-clicking** 
and dragging the mouse on either handle will adjust the duration of the clip by moving that handle. To move the clip without adjusting its duration, **Ctrl+Click** and drag on 
the key itself.
[REGION:fullwidth]
![replay_handles.png](replay_handles.png)
[/REGION] 

You can also adjust the starting position and duration of the clip as well as change the ID of the clip by **Right-clicking** on the clip's bar in the timeline and choosing 
the appropriate option from the menu.

![replay_menu.png](replay_menu.png)

To begin recording the particle system(s), **Right-click** on the track and choose **Start Recording Particles** from the context menu.

![replay_start.png](replay_start.png)

When recording is active, the clip bars will be highlighted in the timeline.

![replay_start_bar.png](replay_start_bar.png)

Press the **Play** button in the toolbar to begin playback. The track will record the particles during play back when recording is enabled. 
Once recording is finished, **Right-click** the track again and choose **Stop Recording Particles**.

![replay_stop.png](replay_stop.png)

Now, when you press the **Play** button, the particle system(s) should play back from the recorded clips and you can scrub through the timeline to 
move forward and backward through the clips to inspect the recording.


## Animation Track
The **Animation Track** allows you to animate the properties of _Actors_ over time, to create either dynamic gameplay or cinematic in-game sequences. 
Through the use of this _Track Type_, you can place keyframes to control when and how they play specified animations. 

To add an animation to the _Track_, scrub through the _Track_ and **press** the **Enter** key or **Add Key** Button. When a key has been added, you will be prompted to select 
an animation to add to the track through a pop-up window as shown below. 

[REGION:fullwidth]
![animtrack_animation_select.png](animtrack_animation_select.png)
[/REGION] 

Once an animation has been added to the _Track_, it will be displayed in Blue. You can manipulate the animation by **Left-clicking** the key to select it. 

With the animation selected, you can adjust the length by moving the cursor to the start or end point until the double-arrows are shown as seen below and dragging in either 
direction. 

[REGION:fullwidth]
![animtrack_adjust_time.png](animtrack_adjust_time.png)
[/REGION] 

You can also move the position of the animation on the track by **Control+Left-Clicking** on the animation and dragging it along the _Track_. 

[REGION:fullwidth]
![animtrack_moving.png](animtrack_moving.png)
[/REGION] 

The numbers shown on the animation illustrate the (Start->End) times in which the animation will play. The number following the Start/End times (x0.89 for example), indicate the 
playback rate of the animation where 1.0 is the default and higher numbers increase the speed of the playback while lower numbers decrease the speed. To adjust playback rate, 
hold **Control** when adjusting the length of the animation. 

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Slot Name** | Name of slot to use when playing animation. Passed to _Actor_. When multiple tracks use the same slot name, they are each given a different _ChannelIndex_ when _SetAnimPosition_ is called. |
| **Skip Anim Notifiers** | Skips all anim notifiers. |


## Event Track
The Event Track gives _Matinee_ a mechanism for firing events back into _Blueprints_ at particular points in the sequence. When you place a keyframe on an _Event Track_, you 
will be asked for an **Event Name**. Each unique _Event Name_ will create a new output connector on the _Matinee Actor_. When the sequence reaches the key, any _Blueprint_ nodes 
that are connected to the output will be activated. If you have multiple keys with the same name, one output connector will be created, but it will be activated when each of the 
keys are passed.

Here is an _Event Track_ with one key called "ToggleLight".

![event_track.png](event_track.png)

And this is the _Matinee Actor_ in a _Blueprint_, showing the new output connector which you can connect to fire off events. 

![event_connector.png](event_connector.png)

The ![eventarrows.jpg](eventarrows.jpg) buttons on the _Event Track_ header allow you to control if the output should be fired when the sequence is playing forwards, backwards, 
or both. If the right arrow button is yellow, events on that track will fire as they are passed when the sequence is playing forwards. If the left arrow button is yellow, events 
are fired when the sequence is played backwards.

Regardless of which group the _Event Track_ is in and whether or not an _Actor_ is attached to the group; the _Matinee Actor_ will create an output connector for each key placed 
on its _Track_. You can also **Right-click** on a key to rename it and doing so will rename any other keys with the same name, as well as the output connector on 
the _Matinee Actor_.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Fire Events When Backwards** | If _true_, events for this track will be fired when the _Matinee_ is playing in reverse. |
| **Fire Events When Forwards** | If _true_, events for this track will be fired when the _Matinee_ is playing forwards. |
| **Fire Events When Jumping Forward** | If _true_, allows all of the events in the track to be fired even if the _Matinee_ is skipped. |


## Sound Track
The **Sound Track** is used to play audio from _SoundCues_ during a _Matinee_ sequence. When placing a new key, the _SoundCue_ currently selected in the Content Browser will be used. Keys for the _Sound Track_ appear similar to those of the _AnimControl Track_. You will see a bar with the name of the _SoundCue_ that stretches for the duration of the _SoundCue_.

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |
| **Curve Tension** | Controls the tightness of the curve when using automatic tangents. |
| **Continue Sound On Matinee End** | If _true_, the sounds being played on this track will not be cut off if their duration continues beyond the end of the _Matinee_ sequence. They will continue to play until the sound ends. |
| **Play On Reverse** | If _true_, the sounds being played on this track will only play when the _Matinee_ sequence is played in reverse. They will not play when the sequence is playing forwards. An example of using this feature would be to have different opening and closing sounds for movers. |
| **Suppress Subtitles** | If _true_, any subtitles associated with the sounds being played by this track will not be displayed. |


## Toggle Track
The **Toggle Track** gives _Matinee_ a mechanism for toggling _Emitter Actors_ on or off at particular points in the sequence. When you place a keyframe on a _Toggle Track_, 
you will be presented with the following dialog:

![PSysToggle_Key.png](PSysToggle_Key.png)

The options are:
* **Trigger** - A one-shot activation of the particle system.
* **On** - Turns the particle system on.
* **Off** - Turns the particle system off.

The _Track_ display will show a green bar when an emitter is toggled on to make it easy to identify the state of the _Actor_. This can be seen below for a _Toggle Track_ that

Below are the _Properties_ that can be adjusted for this _Track_ from the Details panel. 

|Property| Description |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **Activate System Each Update** | If _true_, the track will call _ActivateSystem_ on the emitter each update (old 'incorrect' behavior). If _false_, the _ParticleSystem_ will only be activated if it was previously inactive. |
| **Activate with Just Attached Flag** | If _true_, the track will activate the system with the Just Attached flag.  |
| **Fire Events When Backwards** | If _true_, events for this track will be fired when the _Matinee_ is playing in reverse. |
| **Fire Events When Forwards** | If _true_, events for this track will be fired when the _Matinee_ is playing forwards. |
| **Fire Events When Jumping Forward** | If _true_, allows all of the events in the track to be fired even if the _Matinee_ is skipped. |
| **Active Condition** | Sets when the track should be enabled; always, when gore is enabled, or when gore is disabled. |


## Visibility Track
The **Visibility Track** is used to control whether an _Actor_ is visible or not (by way of the **Actor Hidden In Game** property). When adding a new key for this _Track_, you 
are presented with a dialog with options to **Show**, **Hide**, and **Toggle** the associated _Actor_.

The _Track_ display will show a green bar when the _Actor_ is set to visible and later set not visible again to make it easy to identify the state of the _Actor_. This can 
be seen below for a _Visibility Track_ that shows the _Actor_ for 1 second then hides it.

Keys set to toggle the visibility of the _Actor_ are displayed with a small red bar to denote them as toggle keys.
