When opening a **Media Player** asset, the **Media Editor** window will open presenting you with options for playing back and controlling different aspects of your **Media Source** assets. 
In the Media Editor, you can define the player Plug-in used for a Media Source, select between different audio/video tracks (if applicable) as well as define settings for the Media Player itself. 
The **Info** tab inside this editor will also display information about the type of media you are accessing which can be used to debug any potential playback problems. 
Please refer to each of the sections below for more information and a breakdown of the available options. 

## Toolbar

![](Toolbar.png)

The **Toolbar** section of the Media Editor enables you to control the playback of media. 

[REGION:note]
You must first select a valid Media Source from the **Media Library** window that you want to play for the playback options to become available. 
[/REGION]

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| ![](toolbar_1.png) | Saves this Media Player asset (**Ctrl+S**). |
| ![](toolbar_2.png) | Browse to the Media Player asset in the Content Browser (**Ctrl+B**). |
| ![](toolbar_3.png) | Jump to previous item in the Playlist. |
| ![](toolbar_4.png) | Rewind the media source to the beginning. |
| ![](toolbar_5.png) | Reverse playback of the selected media (clicking multiple times increases the seek speed). |
| ![](toolbar_6.png) | Start/Resume media playback. |
| ![](toolbar_7.png) | Pause media playback. |
| ![](toolbar_8.png) | Fast forward media playback (clicking multiple times increases the seek speed). |
| ![](toolbar_9.png) | Jump to the next item in the Playlist. |
| ![](toolbar_10.png) | Close the currently opened media. |


## Player Window

![](Player.png)

The **Player Window** enables you to view the playback of your media as well as define **Playback Options**.
When you open a Media Source and mouse over this window, you will see text overlays that display the name of the file (upper-left), the current player Plug-in being used (upper-right), the state of the media (lower-left), and the current horizontal, vertical fields of view and view rotation (lower-right), which is used for 360 videos.


[REGION:warning]
As of engine 4.18, there are no player plugins that support 360 videos however future iterations of the Media Framework tools will provide more support for them. 
[/REGION]

At the top of the Player Window, there is a text field that displays the URL path (which you can use to Open directly in Blueprint with the **Open URL** Blueprint node). To the right of the URL field, a reload button can be used to reload the current media (similar to pressing the reload button on most web browsers and can be used to reload external URLs that link to the Internet). 
To the left of the URL field, via the drop-down menu, are the **Capture Devices** options. 

### Capture Devices

![](CaptureDevices.png)

The **Capture Devices** menu and options are available when you have a connected and [supported device](Engine/MediaFramework/TechReference) attached to your computer. 
These options enable you to test different audio and capture devices where the URL will update with the selected device. Capture Devices are slightly different the other Media Sources in that you can have multiple devices connected. 
You can use Blueprint (or C++) code to enumerate and filter for specific devices. 

![](Enumerate.png)

[REGION:caption]
Above, in a Blueprint, you can search for enumerate or capture devices to see the list of optional enumerators. 
[/REGION]

In the example below, a sample setup using the **Enumerate Video Capture Devices** node is shown to filter for specified devices that we can use to obtain the URL to open.

## Playlist

![](Playlist.png)

The **Playlist** section of the Media Editor not only displays all of the files contained within a Media Playlist but also enables you to create/save new Media Playlists assets inside your project. 
The arrows in the upper-right corner of the Playlist window function similar to the Toolbar's **Prev** and **Next** buttons and enable you to cycle through Media Sources in your playlist.

![](ActiveMediaPlaylist.png)

[REGION:caption]
Above, an active Media Playlist displays each of the Media Sources contained within it with the arrow marker pointing to the currently playing source. 
[/REGION]

Each Media Source (when active) has a local Media Playlist created inside the Media Editor. You can save the local Media Playlist as a new Media Playlist by clicking the **Save** icon. 

![](UnsavedPlaylist.png)

[REGION:warning]
As of engine 4.18, there currently is no way to add Media Sources to a local Media Playlist, however, support slated for updates in future engine releases. 
[/REGION]


## Details / Info

![](Details.png)

The **Details** panel provides options for controlling playback of the Media Player itself. 

**Playback**

| -------- | ----------- |
| **Play on Open** | When enabled will automatically start to play a Media Source when opening the source through Blueprint or C++. |
| **Shuffle** | When a Playlist is opened, if this option is enabled, the player will randomly select a source within the playlist rather than playback sequentially. |

[/REGION]

### Info Panel

![](InfoPanel.png)

The **Info** panel provides information about the selected Media Source that you can use for debugging purposes. 
This window displays the player Plug-in associated with the file, the number of video and audio streams and information about video and audio tracks such as the codec being used, sample rate and dimensions. 

Any errors when trying to playback video will be displayed here, for example, if you attempt to load an unsupported format, it will list it in this window as **Not supported**. 
Additionally, you can use the **Copy to Clipboard** button to copy this information out which you can use to post to our official forums or [Answer Hub](https://answers.unrealengine.com/) pages to get help with and troubleshoot any playback issues.
