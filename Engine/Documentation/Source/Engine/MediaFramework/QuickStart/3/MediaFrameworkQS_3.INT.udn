In previous steps, we set up our media content and created a Material that will be used to play our video. 
In the next few steps, we will use [](Engine/Blueprints) (Unreal Engine's visual node-based scripting system) to create an interactable TV Blueprint that will enable players to walk up to and turn on/off our specified video content. In this step, we add the **Components** that will make up our interactable TV.

## Steps

1. Inside the **Content Browser**, create a folder called **Blueprints**. Navigate to that folder and right-click to create a new **Blueprint Class**.

1. In the **Pick Parent Class** window, select **Actor**, then name the Blueprint **TV_Blueprint**.

	Picking a [Parent Class](Engine/Blueprints/UserGuide/Types/ClassBlueprint) is a way to inherit properties or functionality from an existing class (we just want a generic Actor that can be spawned or placed in the world). 

1. Open the **TV_Blueprint**. In the upper-left, click the **+Add Component** button and search for and add a **Static Mesh**.

	[Components](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Actors/Components) are a special type of Object designed to be used as sub-objects within Actors. 
	In this case, we need a **Static Mesh** to represent our TV, a **Box Collision** volume to tell us when the player is in range to turn on/off the TV, and a **Media Sound** Component to play the audio associated with our Media Player.

1. For the **Static Mesh**, name it **TV_Mesh**. In the **Details** panel, set the **Static Mesh** field to **SM_TV**.

1. Click the **+Add Component** button and add a **Box Collision** Component. Resize it in the viewport as desired in front of the TV.

	You can use the [Transform Tools](GettingStarted/HowTo/ManipulatingActors) and widget in the viewport to **Translate (W-key)**, **Rotate (E-key)** or **Scale (R-key)** the box.

1.	Click the **+Add Component** button and add a **Media Sound** Component. 

	![](Blueprint_06.png)

	The **Media Sound** Component is needed to play audio associated with a video file. 

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **Media Sound** Component, set the **Media Player** field to **MediaPlayer_01**. 

	![](Blueprint_07.png)

	Now when we open the Media Player, this Media Sound Component will also open and begin playing the audio associated with the video playing.

		

## End Result

With each of the Components for our TV Blueprint set up, in the next step, we will define some of the options that we want to be customizable within our TV Blueprint. This will enable us to define in the Editor what Media Texture and Media Sound are associated with a TV in the Level and change them on a per-instance basis (enabling us to have the same TV Blueprint, playing different content on each).
