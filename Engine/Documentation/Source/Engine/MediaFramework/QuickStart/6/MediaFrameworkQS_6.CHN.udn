Here are some additional things to try with your project using the Media Framework tools: 

* Allow the player to [fast-forward or rewind](Engine\MediaFramework\HowTo\ControllingPlayback) the Media Source. 
* Allow the player to turn off the TV and [resume playback](Engine\MediaFramework\HowTo\ResumePlayback) when turning it back on instead of starting it over. 
* Use a [Media Playlist](Engine\MediaFramework\HowTo\MediaPlaylists\) as a Media Source and allow the player to "change the channels" for the TV.
* Add a third TV Blueprint to the level with its own Media Player, Media Sound and Media Source assets. 

Below is an example of expanding on our TV Blueprint and allowing the player to change channels, fast-forward and rewind, as well as resuming playback after turning the TV off.
