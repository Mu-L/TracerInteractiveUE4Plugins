Here are some additional things to try with your project using the Media Framework tools: 

* Enable the player to [control playback](Engine/MediaFramework/HowTo/ControllingPlayback) of the TV.
* Use a [Media Playlist](Engine\MediaFramework\HowTo\MediaPlaylists\) as a Media Source and allow the player to "change the channels" for the TV.
* Add a third TV Blueprint to the level with its own Media Player, Media Sound, and Media Source Assets. 

Below is an example of expanding on our TV Blueprint, enabling the player to change channels, fast-forward, and rewind, as well as resuming playback after turning the TV off:
