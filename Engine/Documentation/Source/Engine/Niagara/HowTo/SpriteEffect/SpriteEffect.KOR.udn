One of the most used visual effects techniques is to render Texture and Materials to a 2D camera facing plans, called sprites. In the following How - to we will take a look setting up a Niagara Emitter to work with sprites so that when the effect is placed in a level, it will work and be displayed correctly.

## Steps

[region:note]
This How - to will make use of the **M_smoke_subUV** Material that can be found with the **Starter Content**. If you have not done so already, make sure that this Material or the Starter Content has been added to your project.

1. First, we will need to create a **Niagara Emitter** by right-clicking in the **Content Browser** and from the displayed menu go to **FX** and then click on the **Niagara Emitter**.
