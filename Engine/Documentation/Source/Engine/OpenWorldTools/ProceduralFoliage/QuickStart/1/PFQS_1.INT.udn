In this step we will create a new Level, Landscape Terrain and all of the Actors the Procedural Foliage Tool requires.


1. Create a new level using the **Default Template** as a base.

1. Add a new Landscape actor to the level by first clicking on the **Landscape Tool** icon and then pressing the **Create** button to add the Landscape Actor to the level.

	If you are not familiar with how Landscape Terrain works or would like to know more about how it works please check out [](Engine/Landscape) for more information.

1. Exit the Landscape tool by clicking on the **Place** icon in the **Modes Panel**.

	[region:note]
	Using a Landscape Terrain Actor quickly provides you with a very large area to spawn your forest on.

1. Create a new Procedural Foliage Spawner by **right-clicking** in the **Content Browser** expanding the **Miscellaneous** section and then click on the **Procedural Foliage Spawner**.

1. Name the Procedural Foliage Spawner in this example **PFS_Example** or something similar.

1. Drag the Procedural Foliage Spawner from the **Content Browser** into the level and position it so that it is in the center of the level or at **0,0,200** in the X, Y, and Z axis.

1. Scale Procedural Foliage Spawner to **100,100,10** in the X, Y and Z Axis to give up a large area to spawn our forest in.

1. Now that we have our spawner, we need to give it some types of Foliage to spawn. To do this, **right - click** in the **Content Browser** expanding the **Miscellaneous** section and then click on the **Foliage Type**. Name the Foliage Type **Tree_00** or something similar.

1. At this point you should have something that looks similar to the image below. If you have not done so already, save your work and level by pressing the **Save All** button to save all content and the **Save** button to save the level. 
	When prompted for a level name use the name **PFT_00**.
