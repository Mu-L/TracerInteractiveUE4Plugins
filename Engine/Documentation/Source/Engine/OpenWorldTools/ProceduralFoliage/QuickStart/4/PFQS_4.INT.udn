Adding another species of tree to our virtual forest will greatly help to increase the realism and overall look and feel. 
Luckily for us the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** allows for you to spawn multiple **Foliage Types** resulting in one single **Procedural Foliage Spawner** being able to spawn an entire forest with a multitude of different trees. 
In the following section we will take a look at how you can set up a Procedural Foliage Spawner to work with multiple Foliage Types.
We will be continuing to work with the **PFT_00** level that was used in the last step.

1. Inside of the **Content Browser** select the **Tree_00** Foliage Type and then press **Ctrl + W** on the Keyboard to duplicate it using **Tree_01** as the name.

1. Open the newly created **Tree_01** Foliage Type up and under the **Mesh** section change the mesh to the **ScotsPineTall_01** Static Mesh.

1. Open up the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** from the **Content Browser** and expand the **Foliage Types** section.

1. Click on the **Plus** sign icon to add the option to input another Foliage Type.

1. From the **Content Browser** select the **Tree_01** Foliage Type and then in the Procedural Foliage Spawner under the **Foliage Types** add the **Tree_01** Foliage Type to the empty **Foliage Type Object** by pressing the white **Arrow** icon.

1. Select the **Procedural Foliage Spawner** that was placed in the level and then click on the **Resimulate** button. When completed you should see something like the following image.

1. To make the forest look more interesting open up the **Tree_01** Foliage Type and adjust the following parameters with the following values. 
	The numbers and options that are listed below were selected because they will produce a forest that has interesting clustering and growth interaction with the Foliage Types that are already used. 
	However please feel free to experiment with these numbers and settings till you get something that suits your needs. 

	* **Num Steps:** 4 
	* **Initial Seed Density:** 0.125
	* **Average Spread Distance:** 100
	* **Can Grow in Shade:** Enabled
	* **Spawns in Shade:** Enabled
	* **Max Age:** 15
	* **Overlap Priority:** 1
	* **Procedural Scale:** Max 5.0

1. Once the settings have been adjusted click on the **Resimulate** button on the Procedural Foliage Spawner and you should now have something that looks similar to the image below.
