Description:Information on working with Flipbook Components in Blueprints or C++. 
Version: 4.9


**Flipbook Components** are regular primitive components, and can be posed arbitrarily in 3D, attached to other components, or have other components attached to them. Each Flipbook Component instance can specify a custom color that will be passed down to the Flipbook Material as a Vertex Color. They can also have a custom Material specified that will override the default Material defined in the Flipbook. 

You can change the current Flipbook asset by calling **SetFlipbook**, but note that this will only work if the **Mobility** property is set to **Moveable** (or if it is called during the construction of the Actor). You can also control play rate, play direction, looping, etc. with various other methods on the component. 

[REGION:note]
While C++ documentation for working with Flipbook Components is still in development, you can refer to [UPaperFlipbookComponent](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Plugins/Paper2D/UPaperFlipbookComponent/index.html) for more information on using them in your code until more detailed documentation comes online.
