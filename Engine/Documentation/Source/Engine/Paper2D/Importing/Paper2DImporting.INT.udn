Paper 2D in Unreal Engine 4 supports a number of different import options for your externally created content. Below are some examples of importing assets from some of the more commonly used content creation applications. 


## Importing from Texture Packer

If you are using the third party sprite sheet generation tool **Texture Packer** for content creation, it has a plug-in built into it which will allow you to easily import your content into Unreal Engine 4 by creating a **.paper2dsprites** file. This file when imported into UE4 will automatically import your sprite sheet as a texture, extract and create sprites from it as well as create a **Sprite Asset** which can be used to auto-generate **Flipbooks** out of your sprites. 

**Example Workflow**

1.	Inside **Texture Packer**, select the **UnrealEngine - Paper2d** framework option.

1.	Add your assets that will be included in the sprite sheet. 

	![](Assets_Added.png)(w:640)

1.	Under **Layout** set **Size Constraints** to **POT (Power of 2)**. 

1.	Under **Sprites**, show advanced and set **Border** and **Shape Padding** to **0**.

	This will eliminate the spaces between your sprites, making it easier to tile them together or create **Flipbook** animations. 

1.	Click the **Publish** sprite option (this will create a **.paper2dsprites** file along with a **.png** sprite sheet) 

1.	Drag the **.paper2dsprites** file into the **Content Browser** of your project to import it. 

	![](DragAndDrop.png)(w:800)

	The .png file is already included with the .paper2dsprites file so there is no need to import that as well. 

1.	This will create a **Sprite Sheet** asset and two folders **Frames** (extracted sprites) and **Textures** (your sprite sheet).

From here you can **Right-click** on...

* Your **Sprite Sheet** asset to automatically generate **Flipbooks** based on your sprites. 
* Your imported texture to adjust its settings, configure it for retro sprites or create a **Tile Set** based on it. 
* Your individual frames to manually add them to a **Flipbook**. 


## Importing from Tiled / Adobe Flash CS6

If you are building your content in external content generation tools such as **Tiled** or **Adobe Flash CS6**, you can import your work into Unreal Engine 4 in the **.json** file format. This will automatically import the sprite sheet(s) used to create your map and create **Tile Sets** and a **Tile Map** based off those assets for you. 

**Example Workflow for Tiled**

1.	Inside **Tiled**, choose the File/Save As option, then Save as type **.json**.

1.	Drag-and-drop the **.json** asset into the **Content Browser** of your project.

1.	This will import your sprite sheet textures, create **Tile Sets** and a **Tile Map** from those textures.

	Opening the **Tile Map** created, you will see the map constructed externally which can be modified inside Unreal Engine 4.
