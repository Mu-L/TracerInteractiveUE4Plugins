No matter what platform your UE4 project is targeting, reducing the size of the packaged game can be challenging. In the following guide, we will cover steps you can take to help reduce your projects final package size to be as small as possible using nothing but the tools provided to you in the UE4 Editor.

[EXCERPT:main]
## Creating a New Empty Project

When you first start working on your Android based mobile project, you might be tempted to use an existing project as a base to work from or create a new project that has the Starter Content enabled. Do not do this, instead, create an entirely new, empty C++ or **Blueprint** based project, and then use the [Migration Tool](Engine/Content/Browser/UserGuide/Migrate) to bring over the content that you want to use. This way, you ensure that the only content in your project is content that needs to be there.

## Compressing Cooked Content

The easiest and quickest way to reduce your APK package size is to tell UE4 to compress the APK packages during the packing process. To turn on package compression, you need to do the following in the UE4 Editor.

1.  First, open up the project's settings by going to the Main Toolbar and selecting the **Edit** option, then selecting **Project Settings**.

1.  Under the Project section, click on the **Packaging** section to show the options for how the project will be packaged.

1.  Look for the option labeled **Create compressed cooked packages** and enable it (if not already enabled).

    [/REGION]

If you have not packaged your game with the Create compressed cooked packages checkmark box enabled you should see a huge difference in size when your project is re-packaged with it enabled. In fact, it is not uncommon for some project's APK packages to be reduced in size by up to 50% when **Create compressed cooked packages** is enabled.

## Shared Material Shaders & Libraries

Enabling both **Share Material Shader Code** and **Share Material Native Libraries** will help to reduce the overall package size of your project, but this comes at the cost of increased loading times. To enable this option in your UE4 project, you will need to do the following:

1.  First, on the **Main Toolbar** go to **Edit** > **Project Settings**.

1.  At the bottom of the **Packing** section, there will be the following two checkmark boxes that you should enable.

    * **Share Material Shader Code**
    * **Share Material Native Libraries**

## Excluding Editor Content

Enabling this option will make sure that none of the content that the UE4 Editor uses will be packaged in your project. Note that enabling this could cause issues with missing content in projects that might make use of the Editor content. To enable these two options in your UE4 project, you will need to do the following:

1.  First, on the **Main Toolbar** go to **Edit** > **Project Settings**.

## Setting up a Project's Levels

One often overlooked area that can lead to the bloating of your projects APK package sizes is failing to correctly set up project's options, like which level should be used by default, or which level is used for level transitions. To set which level (or levels) should be used for this type of interaction, you can do the following.

1.  First, on the **Main Toolbar** go to **Edit** > **Project Settings**.

    [OBJECT:ToggleButtonContent]

    [![](T_Set_Maps.png)(w:518)](T_Set_Maps.png)
    [/REGION]
    [REGION:caption]
    Click for full image.
    [/REGION]

1.  Click the arrow next to **Game Default Map** , and from the **Asset List**, select the map that should be used for the game's default starting level.

    [/REGION]
    [REGION:caption]
    Click for full image.
    [/REGION]

1.  Repeat this process until you have level's input for each required map type.

## Selecting which Content to Package or not Package

In the Packaging section of your project settings, you can specify which maps and content should or should not be packaged with your game. To specify which maps should be included in your project you will need to do the following:

[REGION:warning]
If you do not specify which maps should be cooked then all maps will be cooked including any testing maps that you might have. Failing not to specify which maps should be cooked will result in your final packaged game being bigger than it needs to be.

## Checking what Content will be Cooked

To ensure that only the content that is related to your project is added to your APK file, you can check which content is being added to your project's APK by looking in the **Cooked** folder in your project. You can find the Cooked folder by going to `(ProjectName)\Saved\Cooked` and then choose the folder with the format you cooked your project for.

[REGION:note]
Please note that you will only be able to see the content in the **Cooked** folder after you complete your first cook.

The image below shows the Texture folder from the Match 3 sample game. The content in the folder has been sorted by size, so it is easier to see what assets are the biggest. Once the most significant assets have been determined, you can then examine the assets inside of UE4 to see if in fact they can be reduced in size without sacrificing the integrity of the asset.

## Development Versus Shipping Build Size

When trying to figure out the final size your project will be, keep in mind that the Development version of your project will be slightly larger than your Shipping build size. On the Medieval Match example game, the difference in size between a Development and Shipping build was around 14 percent. However, since each project has different requirements, the saving between the two different build types for your project could be more or less than a 14 percent savings.

## Per-Device Texture LOD's

With the release of Unreal Engine 4.8, you can now specify which size Texture should be used on which devices. You can read more about this in the [Texture Guidelines for Mobile Platforms](Platforms/Mobile/Textures) section.

## Removing Unused Content

When your project is finally ready to be packaged up for the store, make sure to first remove any unused or testing content by selecting it in the Content Browser and deleting it. You can delete content by first selecting the content you want to delete and then either press the **Delete** key on the keyboard or use the Delete option in the right-click menu. When you do try and delete something from your project, the Delete Assets menu will be displayed like in the following image.

[REGION:tip]
This is the preferred method of deleting objects in UE4 and should be used over just simply deleting/removing the assets from their location in the content folder.

The Delete Assets menu will inform you if the asset you are trying to delete is referenced by another asset. If it is not referenced, you can simply delete it, however, if it is referenced by other assets, you can use the **Replace References** option to replace the reference to that asset to another asset that is supposed to be packaged in your project.

## Removing Unused Plugins

Disabling any unused **Plugins** inside of the UE4 Editor is another way to ensure that unnecessary content and code do not make it into your project's final APK package file. This is because some **Plugins** require a particular set of base assets and code to work correctly. If the **Plugin** is not disabled, the assets and code that are needed to make the **Plugin **n work will not be removed from your project. While this might not reduce your project's size as much as reducing or removing a large Texture would, every little bit can help when trying to slim your project down to the 100 MB size. To disable a plug-in inside of UE4, you need to do the following:

[REGION:note]
Make sure you thoroughly test your project to ensure that the **Plugins **you are disabling do not interfere with the functionality of your project.
[/REGION]

1.  First, open up the **Plugins **Manager by going to the **Main Toolbar** and clicking on the **Window** option and then selecting the **Plugins** option.

## Package Black List

You can now place a text file in your project's **Build/Platform/(Target Platform Folder)** directory that will tell the cooker to exclude partial or complete file paths from being packaged into your project. Projects can have multiple Black List files for Debug, Development, Test, and Shipping builds that can be set up to include or exclude whatever project data you want. You can even have different Black List files for each platform your project supports like one for Android, one for iOS, etc. Here is an example of what the Black List files would look like for Match 3 on Android.

The first three entries should be safe for any project, but there may be cases where the **AssetRegistry.bin** is needed at runtime (depending on your project). It is highly recommended that you thoroughly test to ensure that the content you are removing will not negatively impact your project. An easy and straightforward way to go about this is to open up all your project's levels to ensure that they correctly load and have no errors or warnings. If you run into further problems and are not sure where they are coming from, check the [Logcat](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/logcat.html) for errors.

## Max Movable Spotlights / Point Lights

The property, **Max Movable Spotlights / Point Lights** can help reduce the number of shaders that are generated for dynamic lights. This feature is particularly useful for mobile games that do not require dynamic lighting and can be found in the **Rendering** section of **Project Settings** under **Mobile Shader Permutation Reduction**.

## Build with Hidden Symbols

You can build the shipping configuration with hidden visibility by default which will result in a smaller .so file. However, this will also remove symbols used to display call stack dumps so your ability to debug crashes, will be limited. To enable these this option in your UE4 project, you will need to do the following:

1.  First, open up the project's settings by going to the Main Toolbar and selecting the **Edit** option, then selecting **Project Settings**.
