**Note:** Running the editor with the `LOG` command enables developers to record useful information from a stat **dump**, and to do so, enable the editor (game project) to generate a log file by running it with the `LOG` command (for example, `UE4Editor.exe -silent LOG=MyLog.txt`).

## Commands

### Levels 
[REGION:lightbox]

[/REGION]
[REGION:caption]
Click for full image.
[/REGION]

The **stat levels** command displays level streaming information, which are grouped under the persistent level.

#### Use Case

This command is useful for developers wanting to view a list of currently active levels, including whether they are visible, pre-loading, loading, or unloading. Additionally, this command displays how many seconds it took to go from a load request to load finish.

#### Usage

To view streaming level information, enter `stat levels` into **PIE Console**.

[REGION:note]
**Note:** To determine what state a level is in, refer to the Level Color Codes table below.
[/REGION]

##### Level Color Codes

[REGION:simpletable]  
| Color Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Green** | Level is loaded and visible. |
| **Red** | Level is unloaded. |
| **Orange** | Level is in the process of being made visible. |
| **Yellow** | Level is loaded but not visible. |
| **Blue** | Level is unloaded but still residing in memory, and it will be cleaned up when garbage collection occurs. |
| **Purple** | Level is pre-loading. |
[/REGION]

### StartFile

[REGION:lightbox]

[/REGION]
[REGION:caption]
Click for full image.
[/REGION]

The **stat startfile** command starts a statistics capture, and creates a new file in a **Profiling** directory. Typically, the engine saves statistics captures under `[UE4ProjectFolder]\[ProjectName]\Saved\Profiling\UnrealStats`.

#### Use Case

To profile a project's performance with **Session Frontend Profiler,** capture statistical samples and log them to `*.ue4stats` files.

#### Usage

To capture and log statistics to a `*.ue4stats` file, enter `stat startfile` into **PIE Console**.
[REGION:warning]
To prevent **StartFile** from bloating the disk with large `ue4stats` files, run **stat StopFile**. Additionally, even if PIE Mode is closed, StartFile will continue running in the background, which can result in bloated log files, so make sure to run the **StopFile** command to stop logging the project's performance.
[/REGION]

#### Loading Statistics

To load statistics into **Session Frontend Profiler**:

1.  From Unreal Editor, select **Window** \> **Developer Tools** \> **Session Frontend**.  
    ![](StatStartFIle_LoadFiles1.png "StatStartFIle_LoadFiles1.png")

2.  With **Session Frontend** open, select the **Profiler** tab (1), and click **Load** (2).

3.  After selecting a `*.ue4stats` file, click **Open** to load the file.  
    ![](StatStartFIle_LoadFiles3.png "StatStartFIle_LoadFiles3.png")

##### End Result

After **Session Frontend** loads the file, the capture data is visible in the **Profiler** for further analysis.

**Note:** Read the [Profiler Tool Reference](Engine/Performance/Profiler) to learn more about reviewing profile captures in **Session Frontend**.
[/REGION]

### StopFile

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](StatStopFile_overview.png "StatStopFile_overview.png")](StatStopFile_overview.png)
[/REGION]

Click for full image.
[/REGION]

The **stat stopfile** command stops a statistics capture that was started by the **StartFile** command. Additionally, the **StopFile** command closes the file that was created in the `Profiling` directory.  

#### Use Case

To prevent StartFile from bloating the disk with large `ue4stats` files, run stat **StopFile**. Additionally, even if PIE Mode is closed, StartFile will continue running in the background, which can result in bloated log files, so make sure to run the StopFile command to stop logging the project's performance.

#### Usage

To stop capturing and logging statistics, enter `stat stopfile` into **PIE Console**.

### Unit

#### Use Case

Typically, developers want to determine if a bottleneck (negative performance impact) exists in the **Game** thread, in the **Draw** (rendering) thread, or on the **GPU**.

[/REGION]

The **stat unit** command displays performance information for the project's **Frame**, **Game**, **Draw**, **GPU**, **RHIT**, and **DynRes** threads.

#### Statistics

[REGION:simpletable]
| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Frame** | Frame time is the total amount of time spent generating one frame of the game. Since both the Game and Draw threads sync up before finishing a frame, Frame time is often close to the time being shown in one of these threads. |
| **Game** | If Frame time is close to Game time, the game's performance is likely being bottlenecked (negatively impacted) by the game thread. |
| **Draw** | If Frame time is close to Draw time, the game's performance is likely being bottlenecked by the rendering thread |
| **GPU** | GPU time measures how long the video card takes to render the scene. Since GPU time is synced to the frame, it will likely be similar to Frame time. |
| **RHIT** | Typically, RHI Thread time is synced to the frame, and it will likely be similar to Frame time. |
| **DynRes** | [INCLUDE:#excerpt_3] |

<!--
[EXCERPT:excerpt_3]

If supported (and enabled), [DynRes](Engine/Rendering/DynamicResolution) shows Primary Screen Percentage by Secondary Screen Percentage.  

[/EXCERPT:excerpt_3]
-->
[/REGION]

#### Usage

To determine the project's bottleneck, launch the game in a non-debug build, and enter `stat unit` into **PIE Console**.
