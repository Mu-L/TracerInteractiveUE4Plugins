The **Cloth Paint Tools** have many options and properties that you can use to make very specific clothing simulations. Below you'll find the details about the menu options 
you can use when creating your clothing assets and details about the Cloth Paint panel that you will use when selecting different painting tools to paint cloth values
for your render mesh.


## Clothing Asset Creation Menus

In this section, you'll find the details about the properties and settings you can use when creating and applying your clothing assets to your render mesh.

### Section Selection

The **Section Selection** enables you to select the different material elements of your render mesh to create and apply a clothing asset.  In this menu, you can identify the LOD and a material section of your 
mesh that you've selected, create a cloth asset for your render mesh and its LODs, apply the clothing asset to the selected section, and remove it later if needed.

### Assets

The **Assets** window displays your currently created clothing assets that are assigned to a render mesh, enable you to import APEX (.apx or .apb) files, and lets you select from the available LODs 
created for your mesh to copy parameter values to.

### Config

The **Config** properties enables you to adjust how your cloth react so that it can simulate different types of material, such burlap, rubber, leather, and much more.

![](Config.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Physics Asset** | The Physics Asset to extract collisions from when building a simulation. |
| **Wind Method** | How wind should be processed; Accurate uses drag and lift to make the cloth react differently, Legacy applies similar forces to all clothing without drag and lift (similar to APEX). [INCLUDE:#windmethod] |
| **Vertical Constraint Config** | Constraint data for vertical constraints. [INCLUDE:#constraintgconfig] |
| **Horizontal Constraint Config** | Constraint data for horizontal constraints. [INCLUDE:#constraintgconfig] |

| **Self Collision Cull State** | The scale to use for the radius of the culling checks for self-collisions. Any other self-collision body within the radius of this check will be culled.

| **Damping** | The damping of particle motion per-axis. |
| **Friction** | The friction of the surface when colliding. |
| **Wind Drag Coefficient** | The drag coefficient for wind calculations, where higher values mean wind has a more lateral effect on cloth. |
| **Wind Lift Coefficient** | The lift coefficient for wind calculations, where higher values make cloth rise easier in the wind. |
| **Linear Drag** | The drag applied to linear particle movement per-axis. |
| **Angular Drag** | The drag to angular particle movement, where higher values should limit material bending (per-axis). |
| **Linear Inertia Scale** | The scale for linear particle inertia, or how much movement should translate to linear motion (per-axis). |
| **Angular Inertia Scale** | The scale for angular particle inertia, or how much movement should translate to angular motion (per-axis). |
| **Centrifugal Inertia Scale** | The scale for centrifugal particle inertia, or how much movement should translate to angular motion (per-axis). |
| **Solver Frequency** | The frequency of the position solver, where lower values will lead to stretchier, bouncier cloth. |
| **Stiffness Frequency** | The frequency for stiffness calculations, where lower values will degrade stiffness of constraints. |
| **Gravity Scale** | The scale of gravity effect on the cloth particle simulation. |
| **Tether Stiffness** | The scale for stiffness of particle tethers between each other. |
| **Tether Limit** | The scale for the limit of particle tethers (how far they can separate). |
| **Collision Thickness** | The "thickness" of the simulated cloth, which is used to adjust collisions. |
