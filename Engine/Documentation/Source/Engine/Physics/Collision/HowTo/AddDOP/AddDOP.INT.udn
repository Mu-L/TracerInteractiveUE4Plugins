There are a series of menu options in the **Static Mesh Editor** under the **Collision** menu entry, named _##DOP_, these are the **K-DOP** simple collision generators. **K-DOP** is a type of bounding volume, which stands for _K discrete oriented polytope_ (where K is the number of axis aligned planes). Basically it takes K axis-aligned planes and pushes them as close to the mesh as it can. The resulting shape is used as a collision hull. In the **Static Mesh Editor** K can be:


* **10** - Box with 4 edges beveled - you can choose X- Y- or Z-aligned edges.
* **18** - Box with all edges beveled.
* **26** - Box with all edges and corners beveled.

See below for an example. This tool is quite handy for packages full of pipes, pillars, and railings:
