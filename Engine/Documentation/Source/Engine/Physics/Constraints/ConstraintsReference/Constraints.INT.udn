[EXCERPT:p1]
![](propConstraint.png)

[REGION:raw]
| Property  | Description |
| ---  | :--- |
| **Constraint Actor 1** | When a **Physics Constraint** is placed into the level editor you must specify **Actors** to constrain. This is the first of 2 **Actors**. |
| **Component Name 1** | The first target component that will be constrained. This can be specified when using **Actors** to constrain only a specific component and not the **Actor** root. |
| **Constraint Actor 2** | When a **Physics Constraint** is placed into the level editor you must specify **Actors** to constrain. This is the second of 2 **Actors**. |
| **Component Name 2** | The second target component that will be constrained. This can be specified when using **Actors** to constrain only a specific component and not the **Actor** root.  |
| **Joint Name** | When constraining in the **Physics Asset Tool**, this is the name of the Bone that is initially constrained. |
| **Constraint Bone 1** | When constraining in the **Physics Asset Tool**, this is the name of the first joint to constrain. |
| **Constraint Bone 2** | When constraining in the **Physics Asset Tool**, this is the name of the second joint to constrain. |

## Constraint Behavior

| **Projection Angular Tolerance** | If the rotational error exceeds this value, in degrees, the body will be projected. |

## Further Information

### Joint Setup

By using the Joint Presets, you can quickly generate the basic settings for the most common of joint types.

![](PhysCon_JointPresets.png)

Note that the icon for the Physics Constraint changes based on the type of joint it is.

[REGION:lightbox]

[/REGION]

_From left to right: Hinge, Prismatic, and Ball and Socket icons._

### Linear Freedom and Limits

![](PhysCon_LinearProps.png)

Under most circumstances, the Linear Motions' freedoms will remain locked. However, there are times when having a joint free or having limited motion along one of these Linear Motions makes sense. Here is how a Physics Constraint will appear if a Linear Motion or Motions are set to Limited and Free:

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](PhysCon_Linear_15uu.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_Linear_15uu.png) [![](PhysCon_Linear_Free.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_Linear_Free.png)
[/REGION]

_From left to right (Physics Constraint scaled up 4x): Linear Motions limited to 15 Units, and Linear Motions set to free._

### Angular Freedom and Limits

![](PhysCon_AngularLimitsProps.png)

Physics Constraints can have their 3 rotational axes set to **Locked**, **Free**, or **Limited**. This will form the basis for a joint such as a hinge that can only rotate on one axis for 90 degrees. The location of the Actor defines where the joint is, thusly, it defines the point at which the constrained Actors will rotate from.

Physics Constraints define their Swing Motions as rotations on the Y and Z axes, while Twist is rotation along the X axis of the Physics Constraint Actor, not of either of the constrained Actors. So rotating the Physics Constraint Actor can drastically change your results. Swing Limits will be shown as a green cone (or arc if only one is used or the other is limited to 0), and the twist will be shown as an Arc around the X axis.

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](PhysCon_Swing1_45.png)(w:300)](PhysCon_Swing1_45.png) [![](PhysCon_Swing2_45.png)(w:300)](PhysCon_Swing2_45.png) [![](PhysCon_Twist_135.png)(w:300)](PhysCon_Twist_135.png) 
[/REGION]

_From left to right: Swing 1 limited to 45 degrees, Swing 2 limited to 45 degrees, and Twist limited to 135 degrees._

Further, since the joint is located where the Physics Constraint Actor is located, different results will be had by moving it.

[/REGION]

### Orientation

The axes of a Physics Constraint Actor are in line with the rotation of the Physics Constraint Actor, and not aligned between the two objects. Given you desired effect, you will need to be aware of how the constraint is oriented.

For Linear Motions, gravity will drag a constrained Actor down. 

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](PhysCon_Flat.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_Flat.png) [![](PhysCon_Angled.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_Angled.png)
[/REGION]

In either setup, the Physics Constraint has its Linear XMotion set to free, and the constraint is moved up to further reinforce the effect. The setup on the left will remain still until an outside force influences the blue constrained cube, while on the right, due to the orientation of the Physics Constraint Actor, gravity will immediately take over and the blue (Constrained Actor 2) cube will slide down X axis, towards the stack of cubes.

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](PhysCon_SimFlat.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_SimFlat.png) [![](PhysCon_SimAngled.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_SimAngled.png)
[/REGION]

When using Angular limits, it is assumed that the Twist Axis (positive X) will be aligned pointing towards the blue constrained Actor (Constrained Actor 2). 

[REGION:lightbox]
[![](PhysCon_Angular.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_Angular.png) [![](PhysCon_AngularSim.png)(w:453)](PhysCon_AngularSim.png)
[/REGION]

Also, while simulating, you will notice that the cone that represents the angular limits rotates with the blue constrained Actor (Constrained Actor 2), and a yellow line becomes visible (it can be seen in the editor but is drawn behind the blue line). This yellow line represents the neutral position of the constraint and it will remain within the green cone (and the green arc representation that is shown when the Twist limit is enabled).
