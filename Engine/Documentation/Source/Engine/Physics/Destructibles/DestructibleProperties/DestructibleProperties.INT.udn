## Destructible Mesh Category

### Default Destructible Parameters Sub Category

| Property  | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Damage Parameters_ [/REGION] ||
| **Damage Threshold** | The Damage amount which will cause a chunk to fracture (break free). |
| **Damage Spread** | Controls the distance into the destructible Actor to propagate the damage. The damage applied to the chunk is multiplied by Damage Spread to get the propagation distance. |
| **Enable Impact Damage** | Whether to apply damage to a destructible when colliding with an object. |
| **Impact Damage** | If a chunk is at a depth which has impact damage set, it will take damage equal to Impact Damage times the impact force when it collides with another object (assuming Report Rigid Collisions are enabled on both objects). |
| **Custom Impact Resistance** | By default objects that collide with destructibles will bounce back. Custom resistance allows for finer control of how much a destructible "pushes back" against a colliding object. |
| **Impact Resistance** | When a chunk takes impact damage due to physical contact, this parameter is the maximum impulse the contact can generate. Weak materials will have this set low, so heavier objects can pass through them during fracture. 0.0 is interpreted at infinite. |
| **Default Impact Damage** | Impact damage will be taken to this depth. If negative, impact damage is disabled. |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Debris Parameters_ [/REGION] ||
| **Debris Lifetime Min** | "Debris chunks" (see debris Depth, below) will be destroyed after a time (in seconds) separated from non-debris chunks.  The actual lifetime is interpolated between these	two bDebrisTimeout, based upon the module's LOD setting.  To disable lifetime, clear the bDebrisTimeout flag in the flags field. If `debrisLifetimeMax < debrisLifetimeMin`, the mean of the two is used for both.
| **Debris Lifetime Max** | |
| **Debris Max Separation Min** | "Debris chunks" (see debris Depth, below) will be destroyed if they are separated from their origin by a distance greater than maxSeparation. The actual maxSeparation is interpolated between these two values, based upon the module's LOD setting.  To disable maxSeparation, clear the bDebrisMaxSeparation flag in the flags field. If `debrisMaxSeparationMax < debrisMaxSeparationMin`, the mean of the two is used for both.
| **Debris Max Separation Max** | |
| **Valid Bounds** | "Debris chunks" (see debris Depth, below) will be destroyed if they leave this box. The box translates with the destructible Actor's initial position, but does not rotate or scale. |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Advanced Parameters_ [/REGION] ||
|	**Damage Cap** | Limits the amount of damage applied to a chunk.  This is useful for preventing the entire destructible	from getting pulverized by a very large application of damage.  This can easily happen when impact damage is used, and the damage amount is proportional to the impact force (see forceToDamage). |
|	**Impact Velocity Threshold** | Large impact force may be reported if rigid bodies are spawned inside one another.  In this case, the relative velocity of the two objects will be low.  This variable allows the user to set a minimum velocity threshold for impacts to ensure that the objects are moving at a min velocity in order for the impact force to be considered.   |
|	**Max Chunk Speed** | If greater than 0, the chunks' speeds will not be allowed to exceed this value.  Use 0 to disable this feature (this is the default).    |
|	**Fracture Impulse Scale** | Scale factor used to apply an impulse force along the normal of chunk when fractured. This is used in order to "push" the pieces out as they fracture. |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Special Hierarchy Depths_ [/REGION] ||
|	**Support Depth** | The chunk hierarchy depth at which to create a support graph.  Higher depth levels give more detailed support, but will give a higher computational load.  Chunks below the support depth will never be supported.|
|	**Minimum Fracture Depth** | The chunks will not be broken free below this depth. |
| **Debris Depth** | The chunk hierarchy depth at which chunks are considered to be "debris."  Chunks at this depth or below will be considered for various debris settings, such as debrisLifetime. Negative values indicate that no chunk depth is considered debris. |
| **Essential LOD Depth** | The chunk hierarchy depth up to which chunks will always be processed.  These chunks are considered to be essential either for gameplay or visually. The minimum value is 0, meaning the level 0 chunk is always considered essential. |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Depth Parameters - Per Depth Level_ [/REGION] ||
| **Impact Damage Override** | Chunks up to the depth set in Default Impact Damage Depth will take impact damage unless one of the override options is chosen. |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Flags_ [/REGION] ||
| **Accumulate Damage** | If set, chunks will "remember" damage applied to them, so that many applications of a damage amount below damageThreshold will eventually fracture the chunk.  If not set, a single application of damage must exceed damageThreshold in order to fracture the chunk. |
| **Asset Defined Support** | If set, then chunks which are tagged as "support" chunks will have environmental support in static destructibles. Note: if both bAssetDefinedSupport and bWorldSupport are set, then chunks must be tagged as "support" chunks AND overlap the NxScene's static geometry in order to be environmentally supported. |
| **World Support** | If set, then chunks which overlap the NxScene's static geometry will have environmental support in static destructibles. Note: if both bAssetDefinedSupport and bWorldSupport are set, then chunks must be tagged as "support" chunks AND overlap the NxScene's static geometry in order to be environmentally supported. |
| **Debris Timeout** | Whether or not chunks at or deeper than the "debris" depth will time out.  | 
| **Debris Max Separation** | Whether or not chunks at or deeper than the "debris" depth will be removed if they separate too far from their origins.
| **Crumble Smallest Chunks** | If set, the smallest chunks may be further broken down, either by fluid crumbles (if a crumble particle system is specified in the NxDestructibleActorDesc), or by simply removing the chunk if no crumble particle system is specified. |
| **Accurate Raycasts** | If set, the Raycast function will search within the nearest visible chunk hit for collisions with child chunks.  This is used to get a better raycast position and normal, in case the parent collision volume does not tightly fit the graphics mesh.  The returned chunk index will always be that of the visible parent that is intersected, however. |
| **Use Valid Bounds** | If set, the validBounds field of NxDestructibleParameters will be used.  These bounds are translated	(but not scaled or rotated) to the origin of the destructible Actor.  If a chunk or chunk island moves outside of those bounds, it is destroyed. |
| **Form Extended Structures** | If this is set and the destructible is initially static, it will become part of an extended support structure if it is in contact with another static destructible that also has this flag set. |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Fracture Effects - Per Depth Level_ [/REGION] ||
| **Particle System** | The particle system to spawn when a chunk breaks. |
| **Sound** | The sound or sound cue to play when a chunk breaks.|

### Skeletal Mesh Sub Category

| **Property** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------- |
| [REGION:tablesection] _Materials - Per Element_ [/REGION] ||
| **Material Interface** | The material to use for this element. |
| **Enable Shadow Casting** | Enables this material to cast shadows. Since this is on a per element level, and each fracture level can have a different material, you can turn off shadows at the smaller levels of a fractured object. |
| **Force CPUSkinning** | All skinning defaults to GPU skinning, this will force this destructible Actor to use CPU skinning. |
| **Use Full Precision UVs** | If _true_, this object will use 32bit UV's. If _false_, it will save memory by using 16bit UV's.|
		
### Texture Streaming Sub Category
| **Property** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------- |
| **Streaming Distance Multiplier** | Allows artists to adjust the distance where textures using UV 0 are streamed in/out. 1.0 is the default, whereas a higher value increases the streamed in resolution. |

## Chunk Parameters Category

### Chunks Sub Category
| **Property** | **Description** |
| -------- | --------- |
| **Is Support Chunk** | Defines the chunk to be environmentally supported, if the appropriate NxDestructibleParametersFlag flags are set in NxDestructibleParameters.  |
| **Do Not Fracture** | Defines the chunk to be unfracturable. If this is true, none of its children will be fracturable. |
| **Do Not Damage** | Defines the chunk to be undamagable. This means this chunk will not fracture, but its children might |
| **Do not Crumble** | Defines the chunk to be uncrumbleable. This means this chunk will not be broken down into fluid mesh particles no matter how much damage it takes. Note: this only applies to chunks with no children. For a chunk with children then: 1) The chunk may be broken down into its children, and then its children may be crumbled, if the doNotCrumble Flag is not set on them, 2) If the destructible module's chunk depth offset LOD may be set such that this chunk effectively has no children. In this case, the doNotCrumble flag will apply to it. |
