## Toolbar

| Item | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **![Fracture Mesh](DM_FractureMeshIcon.png)** | This will fracture the meshes root chunk(s) based upon the Fracture Settings. |
| **![Refresh](DM_RefreshIcon.png)** | This will refresh the DestructibleMesh from the StaticMesh it was created from. |
| **![Import FBX Chunks](DM_FBXChunksIcon.png)** | This will import a FBX as depth level 1 chunks. |
| **![Preview Depth](DM_PreviewDepthIcon.png)** | This is a drop down selection to preview a specific depth level of destruction. |
| **![Explode Amount](DM_ExplodeAmtIcon.png)** | This slider will push apart the chunks of the specified Preview Depth. |


## Viewport Panel

The **Viewport** panel shows a rendered view of the Destructible Mesh asset. This allows you to examine the Destructible Mesh as it would be rendered in-game. 
The viewport will also allow you to use different Preview Depths to see your different levels of destruction. This will allow different chunks to be selected which can be used in conjunction with the Chunk Parameters panel settings as well.

## Destructible Settings Panel

The **Destructible Settings** panel shows specific properties pertaining to the Destructible Mesh Actor, such as the Materials applied to the surface and interior, Damage settings, and flags that can enable specific abilities. 

For information about the basics of using this panel, see the [Destructibles Properties Matrix](Engine/Physics/Destructibles/DestructibleProperties) documentation.

## Fracture Settings Panel

The **Fracture Settings** panel shows settings to control how the Destructible Mesh Actor is broken into chunks. There are properties that pertain to the number of chunks the fracture should contain, control for the interior material UVs, and the random pattern seed. 

For information about the basics of using this panel, see the [Destructibles Properties Matrix](Engine/Physics/Destructibles/DestructibleProperties) documentation.

## Chunk Parameters Panel

The **Chunk Parameters** panel contains settings that directly affect specific chunks that are selected in the preview panel when viewing Preview Depth 1 or higher. The settings here can control whether a chunk can be damaged, fractured, crumbled, or even considered as support.
