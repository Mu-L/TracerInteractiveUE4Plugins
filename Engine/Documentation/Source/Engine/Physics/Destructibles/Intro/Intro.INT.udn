## Destructible Actors

These Actors are akin to **Static Mesh** and **Skeletal Mesh** Actors, actually **Destructible Actors** are a combination of both. Though they take in a **Static Mesh** as their foundation, the _fracturing_ process creates a **Skeletal Mesh** that controls all the fractured chunks, making the numerous fractured pieces all one draw call. You place **Destructible Actors** just like you would a **Static Actor**, and just like a Static Actor, you can set it to simulate physics, or it can be kinematic, following an animation or stuck to another moving object, until it receives enough damage to shatter.

Intro in to what a destructible is, how it's used, a rough break down of creation.
