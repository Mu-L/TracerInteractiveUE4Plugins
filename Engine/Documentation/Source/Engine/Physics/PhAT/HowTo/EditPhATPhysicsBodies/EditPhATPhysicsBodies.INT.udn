Below are a number of common procedures, and steps, associated with editing **Physics Bodies** in the **Physics Asset Tool**.

## Editing a Physics Body

1. Enable Body Editing Mode ![](Shared\Icons\icon_PHatMode_Body_40x.png).
1. Select a Physics Body in the Viewport or in the **Hierarchy Pane**.
	* If it is difficult to see the Physics Body you desire, use the **Viewport** -> **Modes** -> **MeshRender Mode** -> **Wireframe/None** to adjust the visibility of the 
	Skeletal Mesh.
1. **Move, rotate, and scale** the Physics Body using the Translation, Rotation, and Scale tools so it fits the Skeletal Mesh and Skeletal Joint.
1. Edit the Physics Body's properties in the Details Pane.
1. **Enable** or **Disable** Collision between the current Physics Bodies and other in the Physics Asset using the _Collision On_ and _Collision Off_ tools. Any Physics Body that can 
collide with the currently selected Physics Body will be blue, if they cannot collide, they will be gray.
1. If a series of bodies should act as one, such as with the twist joints that form a wrist, use the _Weld_ tool to prevent undesired physics simulation behavior. Welded Physics 
Bodies will be yellow in color.
1. Save ![](Shared\Icons\icon_SaveAsset_40x.png) often.

See the **[Physics Asset Tool Reference](Engine/Physics/PhAT/Reference)** for more information on the properties in the Physics Asset Tool.

[REGION:note]
As of change list #1977557, multi select is enabled for Physics Bodies and Physics Constraints, enabling you to edit multiple bodies or constraints at the same time.

## Copying Physics Bodies

While in either mode, properties from one Physics Body can be copied to other Physics Bodies:

1. **Select** the Physics Body you wish to copy data from.
1. **Press Ctrl + C**.
1. **Select** the Physics Bodies you wish to apply data to.
1. **Press Ctrl + V**.

This will not overwrite the shape of a Physics Body.

## Deleting Physics Bodies

1. **Enable** Body Editing Mode ![](Shared\Icons\icon_PHatMode_Body_40x.png).
1. **Select** a Physics Body you wish to delete.
	* If it is difficult to see the Physics Body you desire, use the **Viewport -> Modes -> MeshRender Mode -> Wireframe/None** to adjust the visibility of the Skeletal Mesh.
1. Press the **Delete** key.

## Physical Materials

Each Physics Body in a Physics Asset can have a Physical Material assigned to it. To apply a Physics Material to a single Physics Body:

1. **Enable** Body Editing Mode ![](Shared\Icons\icon_PHatMode_Body_40x.png).
1. **Select** a Physics Body in the Viewport or in the **Hierarchy** Pane.
	* If it is difficult to see the Physics Body you desire, use the **Viewport** -> **Modes** -> **MeshRender Mode** -> **Wireframe/None** to adjust the visibility of the Skeletal 
	Mesh.
1. In the Details pane, locate the Simple Collision Physical Material property and assign a Physics Material.
