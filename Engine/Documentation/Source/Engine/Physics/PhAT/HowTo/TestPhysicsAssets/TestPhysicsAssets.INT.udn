This page covers the basics of testing a **Physics Asset** in the **Physics Asset Tool**.

## Testing

Clicking the Simulation ![](Shared/Icons/icon_PhAT_PlaySim_40x.png) button will allow you to test your Physics Asset.

The downward triangle next to the Simulation button will give you access to **Real Simulation** and **No Gravity**:

* **Real Simulation** - Simulates the entire Physics Asset with gravity enabled.
* **No Gravity** - Simulates the entire Physics Asset but does not turn on gravity, leaving you to **ctrl+click** to poke the Physics Bodies in a zero gravity environment.

	This is useful for finding any interpenetrating Physics Bodies or Limited Physics Constraints already outside of their limits.

You can also simulate a chain of joints by toggling **Selected Simulation** ![](Engine/Physics/PhAT/HowTo/selectedToggle_button.png) on, then clicking the **Simulation** ![](Shared/Icons/icon_PhAT_PlaySim_40x.png) button.

* **Selected Simulation** - Does mostly what it sounds like, it only simulates the Physics Bodies you have selected (using **ctrl+left click** you can select more than one 
Physics Body) and those down the hierarchy from the selected Physics Bodies. So if you select the shoulder, the entire arm will simulate.
