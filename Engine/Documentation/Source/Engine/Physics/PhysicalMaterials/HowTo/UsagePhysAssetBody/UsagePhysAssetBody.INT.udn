Description:How to assign a Physical Material to a specific Physics Body in a Physics Asset using the Physics Asset Tool.
Version: 4.9
SkillLevel: Intermediate


If specific Physics Bodies need differing Physical Materials, you can then adjust them individually.

1. **Open** a Physics Asset in the Physics Asset Tool.

1. **Enable Body Edit Mode** in the Physics Asset Tool.
1. **Select** a Physics Body.
1. In the Details pane, in the Physics Category, change the **Simple Collision Physical Material**.

[COMMENT:none]

The default behavior for Physics interactions with Skeletal Meshes is to only interact with its associated Physics Asset, so the Skeletal Mesh's material's Physical Material will 
not be used.

[REGION:note]
With Physics Assets, though you are setting the Simple Collision Physical Material, when you trace against a Physics Asset, you will need to do a complex trace and the complex trace 
will return the Physical Material listed in the Simple Collision Physical Material property of the hit Physics Body.
