The [](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor) provides several different ways in which you can simulate physics bodies including the ability to have kinematic physics bodies with simulated parents. 
This enables you to define child bodies that can be driven by animation data while the parents of those bodies are driven by physics simulation data. 
This can be useful if you have a character that you want to perform a physics based reaction while playing a hanging idle or hanging traversal animation.

In this How-to, we use kinematic bodies with simulated parents to generate the effect of a character hanging from a ledge while the rest of the body is simulated with physics.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this guide, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.  In your project in the **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh** folder, open the **SK_Mannequin_PhysicsAsset**. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_01.png)

1.	In the **Hierarchy** window, click the **All Bones** drop-down and change it to **Bones With Bodies**. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_02.png)

	This will filter the hierarchy to only show bones with bodies and make it easier to select the bones you want to manipulate. 

1.	In the hierarchy list, hold **Ctrl** and select both the **hand_l** and **hand_r** bones, then in the **Details** panel, change the **Physics Type** to **Kinematic**. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_03.png)

	By setting these bones to Kinematic, they will not simulate physics and will follow any animation data. 

	Alternatively, you can right-click bones in the hierarchy list and set their **Physics Type** from the roll-out menu. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_04.png)

	This option enables you to set the **Physics Type** property for children bodies below the current bone. 

1.	Click on an empty space within the viewport to deselect all bones, then in the **Details** panel, change the **Physics Update Mode** to **Component Transform is Kinematic**. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_05.png)

	This option determines whether the simulation of the root body updates component transform or is kinematic. 

1.	From the toolbar, click the **Simulate** button. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_06.png)

	The character in the viewport will slump over and appear to be hanging by their hands. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_07.png)

1.	From the toolbar, click the **Animation** selection icon, then select the **ThirdPersonJump_Loop** animation. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_08.png)

	The hands (because they are set to kinematic) will follow the animation data contained within the **ThirdPersonJump_Loop** motion. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_09.png)

1.	From the Main Editor window, drag the **SK_Mannequin_PhysicsAsset** into the level and in the **Details** panel, set **Physics Transform Update Mode** to **Component Transform is Kinematic**. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_10.png)

1.	Select the **SkeletalMeshComponent**, then change **Animation Mode** to **Use Animation Asset** and **Anim to Play** to **ThirdPersonJump_Loop**. 

	![](KinematicHowTo_11.png)

1.	Click the **Play** button from the toolbar to play in the editor. 

## End Result

Below we've placed the character near a ledge when we run and bump into it, it reacts to physics while the hands appear slightly fixed.

While the animation we used above not ideal, below we apply the same concept to an animation of a character hanging and traversing a ledge.

The arms and head are set to Kinematic (denoted below with Gold Boxes) while the rest is being simulated.
