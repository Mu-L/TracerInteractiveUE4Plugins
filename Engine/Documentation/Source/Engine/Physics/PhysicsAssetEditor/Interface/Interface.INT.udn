The **Physics Asset Editor** is a tool used for working [Physics Assets](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor) inside of Unreal Engine 4. This editor allows for the visualization and control over the body and 
constraint hierarchy associated with a Skeletal Mesh. In this editor, you can create [Bodies](Engine/Physics/PhysicsBodies) and [Constraints](Engine/Physics/Constraints/ConstraintsReference) that are 
used for collision and simulation of your Skeletal Mesh ragdoll.

Please refer to each section below for a breakdown of the Physics Asset Editor user interface:

## 1. Toolbar

The [Toolbar](Engine/Animation/Persona/Toolbar) inside the Physics Asset Editor provides you with options for saving any changes made to your Physics Asset or locating it in the Content Browser. 
You can set a **Preview Mesh** for this particular Physics Asset, **Enable / Disable Collision** for selected bodies, and **Simulation** settings for testing the Physics Assets ragdoll. On the 
far right of the Toolbar is the **Editor Toolbar** which enables you to switch between the different [Animation Tools](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes) in Unreal Engine 4.

## 2. Skeleton Tree

The [Skeleton Tree](Engine\Physics\PhysicsAssetEditor\Interface\SkeletonTree) shows the skeletal hierarchy of the current Skeleton asset and is where you create bodies and constraints.

## 3. Constraints Graph

The [Constraints Graph](Engine\Physics\PhysicsAssetEditor\Interface\Graph) enables you to have a visual representation of the skeletal hierarchy bodies that are constrained to another body. From this graph, you can create 
your own constraints by pulling off the main body node (left) and selecting a new body to constrain to or even navigate the skeleton tree by double-clicking the end body to jump down the tree
to the next set of bodies and constraints. You can also see which [Physical Animation and Constraints Profiles](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor/Interface/ToolsAndProfiles) are assigned based on the currently selected 
one in the Profiles panel.

## 4. Viewport

The [Viewport](Engine/Animation/Persona/Viewport) window enables you to preview the changes that you make and bodies positioning or preview simulation of the physics ragdoll. From the Viewport, you can
change lighting modes, show or hide the bones, bodies, and constraints of your skeleton, and even set your Skeletal Mesh to automatically rotate around on a turntable allowing you to view it from all angles.

## 5. Asset Details / Preview Scene Settings

The [Details](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details) panel, which is similar to the Main Editor, is primarily used for modifying the properties of added elements like bodies or constraints. For example, 
when add a body or constraint to the Skeleton, clicking on it in the Skeleton Tree or Viewport will populate the Details panel with options related to how the body or constraint functions.

The [Preview Scene Settings](Engine/Animation/Persona/PreviewSettings) panel enables you to quickly assess what your assets will look like in multiple environments and light scenarios without having
to set up these scenes within your level. Several different settings can be defined and applied from Skeletal Meshes and specified animations to play along with lighting and 
[Post Process effects](Engine/Rendering/PostProcessEffects) all within each of the [Animation Tools](Engine/Animation/Persona/Modes) inside of the Editor.

## 6. Tools and Profiles

The [Tools](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor/Interface/ToolsAndProfiles#Toolstab) panel displays the options available for when generating or regenerating new or selected bodies. These are the same options available when creating a 
Physics Asset from the Content Browser, otherwise these are the default settings that will be used when a Skeletal Mesh is imported and **Create Physics Asset** is enabled.

The [Profiles](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor/Interface/ToolsAndProfiles#profilestab) panel enables you to create profiles that can be reused for **Physical Animations** and **Constraints**. These profiles enable you to set 
default settings that can be quickly assigned to other bodies or constraints.
