![](SkeletonTree.png)


The **Skeleton Tree** panel in the [Physics Asset Editor](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor) shows the skeletal hierarchy of the current [Skeleton](Engine/Animation/Skeleton) asset, along with
additional assets like the collision bodies, primitives, and constraints. Within it, you can perform the following actions:

* Select and view specific bones in the skeletal hierarchy with their attached bodies and constraints.
* Create and edit bodies, primitives, and constraints, which can be simulated in the Viewport to see the results of ragdoll animations, constraints, and collision interaction.
* Create preview assets, which are temporarily attached assets; these are good for previewing how a weapon will look on a character, for example.

### Search Line

![](SearchLine.png)

The **Search** line allows for quick filtering of the Skeletal hierarchy by filtering out the hierarchy to only include names based on the entered text. 

![](SearchExample.png)
[REGION:caption] Above, we have filtered the hierarchy to include any Bone Names, Bodies, or Constraints that include the text **Pelvis** in them. [/REGION]

### Bone Hierarchy List

![](BoneHierarchyList.png)

This window shows all the Bones, Bodies, Constraints, Primitives, and Preview Objects currently used by the selected Physics Asset. Inside this window is where you can add and assign collision Bodies, 
Primitives, Constraints, and Preview Objects. Most of the adjustments made in the Bone Hierarchy list is handled through right-click context menus where the menu options vary based on the object 
you right-click on (see the context menu sections below).  


### Selection Context Menus

Within the Bone Hierarchy list, when you right-click on a Bone, Body, Primitive, or Constraint, you access context menus specific to the selection made.

Below are the available context menus and their relative options.

#### Bone Context Menu

When right-clicking on a Bone, you will see the following context menu:

| **Reset Selected Bone Transforms** | Reset the transforms of the selected bones. |
| **Add Preview Asset** | Opens a menu of all eligible assets that can be temporarily attached to a bone for previewing purposes. For instance, if you want to see what a certain piece of armor would look like attached to a bone, this is the option you would use. Note, however, that this is not a permanent attachment and will only be visible while previewing. |
| **Remove All Attached Assets** | Removes all attached assets from the Skeleton and the mesh. |
| **Add/Replace Bodies** | Adds or replaces bodies for the selected bones using the current generation settings found in the [Tools](Engine/Physics/PhysicsAssetEditor/Interface/ToolsAndProfiles#toolstab) tab. |
