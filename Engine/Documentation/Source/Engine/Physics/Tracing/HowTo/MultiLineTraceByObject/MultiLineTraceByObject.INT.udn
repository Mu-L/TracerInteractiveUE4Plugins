**MultiLineTraceForObjects** will perform a collision trace along a given line and return all hits encountered, returning only objects that match one of the specified Object Types. Below, you will find steps for setting up **MultiLineTraceForObjects**. 

## Steps

1.  Follow the steps used for the [LineTraceByChannel](Engine/Physics/Tracing/HowTo/SingleLineTraceByChannel) example to set up a trace. 

1.  Replace the **LineTraceByChannel** node with the **MultiLineTraceForObjects** node. 

1.  Drag off the **Object Types** pin and add a **Make Array** node, then use the drop-down menus to add Objects to the Array.

	Here we assign **WorldDynamic** and **Physics Body** as our Object Types. You can use the **Add pin** button to add more Object Types to the Array. 
	
1.  Drag off the **Out Hits** pin of the trace node and add a **ForEachLoop** node.

	This will allow us to do something for each of the Actors hit by the trace. 

1.  Drag off the **Array Element** and add a **Break Hit Result**. Then, off the **Hit Actor**, add a **To String (Object)** and connect to a **Print String**.

	This will now print to the screen each of the Actors hit by the array.

## Result

Here, we have a hanging ceiling light (World Dynamic Object Type) in front of a Physics Actor (Physics Body Object Type).

**Multi Line Trace by Object**, unlike **Multi Line Trace by Channel**, does not stop at the first object it hits, which is why the trace continues through the light to the cube.
