**LineTraceForObjects** will perform a collision trace along a given line and return the first Object the trace hits that matches one of the specified Object Types. To set up **LineTraceForObjects** trace, do the following: 

## Steps

1.  Follow the steps used for the [LineTraceByChannel](Engine/Physics/Tracing/HowTo/SingleLineTraceByChannel) example to set up a trace. 

1.  Replace the **LineTraceByChannel** node with the **LineTraceForObjects** node. 

1.  Drag off the **Object Types** pin and add the **Make Array** node.

1.  On the **Make Array** node, specify the **ObjectType** you want to trace for (via the drop-down menu).

	[REGION:note]
	Here, we are tracing for **WorldDyanmic** Objects. You can add more by clicking the **Add Pin** button.

1.  You can set the rest of the trace up the same way a **LineTraceByChannel** is setup.

## Result

 We have added a single **WorldDynamic** Object into our level.

Only the added Actor is now returning as a hit; consequently, the cubes (since they are Physics Actors) do not return a hit.
