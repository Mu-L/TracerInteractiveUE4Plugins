For this guide, we'll use a Blank Template project, however, tread with caution if you use an existing project or one of the other template projects because in later steps of this 
guide you may run into conflicts with some parts that are already setup or setup differently than intended by this guide.

## Steps

1. Open **Unreal Engine** from the Launcher. The [Project Browser](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) will appear.

1. Click on the **New Project** tab and then under the **Blueprint** tab, select **Blank** so that you have a clean starting point. You won't need Starter Content, so you can make sure that is set to **No Starter Content**. We'll need a to enter a project name, so we'll use "QuickStart". We can now click **Create Project** and get started.

The **Unreal Editor** will now open our new project.
