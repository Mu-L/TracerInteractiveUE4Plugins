In the previous step we finished setting up our Vehicle Blueprint and assigned all the controls we need to make it work properly. In this last step, we'll finish by setting up a new Game Mode that
is uses our Vehicle Blueprint as the Default Pawn for the game. 

[REGION:note]
If you did not use a blank project template when starting this guide you may find that you already have a Game Mode assigned that conflicts with the one we're creating in this step. Use the steps below
to create a new Game Mode so that you can spawn in the vehicle you've created throughout this guide.
