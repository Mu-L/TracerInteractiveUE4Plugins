You can customize the end user's experience with the Ansel Photography plugin in order to improve that experience, i.e. by disabling certain effects that don't work well in captures, or to control the experience, such as limiting the movement of the camera. Several Blueprint events and functions are available to implement logic to customize the player's experience.

## Events

### On Photography Session Start

Event triggered upon entering Photography mode (before pausing, if `r.Photography.AutoPause` is 1).

### On Photography Session End

Event triggered upon leaving Photography mode (after unpausing, if `r.Photography.AutoPause` is 1).

    [OBJECT:BlueprintNode]
        [PARAMLITERAL:type]
            event

### On Photography Multi Part Capture Start

Event triggered upon the start of a multi-part photograph capture (i.e. a stereoscopic or 360-degree shot).  This is an ideal time to turn off rendering effects that tile badly (UI, subtitles, vignette, very aggressive bloom, etc; most of these are automatically disabled when `r.Photography.AutoPostprocess` is 1).

    [OBJECT:BlueprintNode]
        [PARAMLITERAL:type]
            event

                [/PARAMLITERAL]
                [PARAMLITERAL:id]
                    Exec
                [/PARAMLITERAL]

[/REGION]

### On Photography Multi Part Capture End

Event triggered upon the end of a multi-part photograph capture, when manual free-roaming photographic camera control is about to be returned to the user.  Here you may re-enable whatever was turned off within OnPhotographyMultiPartCaptureStart.

[REGION:graph]
    [OBJECT:BlueprintNode]
        [PARAMLITERAL:type]
            event
        [/PARAMLITERAL]

        [/PARAMLITERAL]
        [PARAM:inputs]
        [/PARAM]
        [PARAM:outputs]
            [OBJECT:BlueprintPin]
                [PARAMLITERAL:type]
                    exec
                [/PARAMLITERAL]
                [PARAMLITERAL:id]
                    Exec
                [/PARAMLITERAL]

## Overridable Functions

**To override the functions listed below:**

1. Select the function you wish to override from the list of overridable functions. The function appears in the **Functions** list and the graph for it is opened so you can edit it.

### Photography Camera Modify

This allows a PlayerCameraManager subclass to constrain or otherwise modify the camera during free-camera photography. For example, a blueprint may wish to limit the distance from the camera's original point, or forbid the camera from passing through walls.
This function gives you the original, previous, and proposed camera positions and takes your modified camera position as a result.

#### Example

Below, is an example implementation of **Photography Camera Modify** which limits the photography camera to within 200 Unreal Units of its original position:
