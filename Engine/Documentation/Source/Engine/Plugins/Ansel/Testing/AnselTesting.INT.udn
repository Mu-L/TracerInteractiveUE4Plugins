**To test the NVIDIA Ansel Photography Plugin with your game:**

1. Run the NvCameraConfiguration.exe application and ensure that **NvCamera Status** is set to _Enable_, which is the default.

		C:\Program Files\NVIDIA Corporation\Ansel\Tools\NvCameraConfiguration.exe

1. In Unreal Editor, select **Play > Standalone Game** in the Level Editor toolbar to run as a Standalone Game. Ansel will not activate when playing in the Editor.

1. Press **Alt + F2** to activate Ansel photography in the game. When a Session has been successfully started, the game world pauses and the Ansel UI will appear over the game view.
