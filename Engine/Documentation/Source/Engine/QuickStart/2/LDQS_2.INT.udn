With the project open and ready to go, the first thing you may notice is the [Viewport](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports) in the center of the Unreal Editor.

Inside the Viewport is where you will do most of your level construction. The template project that we selected in the previous step includes a small sample [Level](Engine/Levels) and some assets for us to get us started with. 
Using this little area as a point of reference, take a moment to get used to the [Viewport Camera Controls](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls) by using the most common methods of navigating the Viewport in Unreal Engine 4. 


## Standard Controls

[INCLUDE:Engine\UI\LevelEditor\Viewports\ViewportControls#StandardControls]

[REGION:tip]
To switch to an [Orthographic View](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Videos/Player?series=PLZlv_N0_O1gasd4IcOe9Cx9wHoBB7rxFl&video=RoiQOwCg-4Q), click the **Perspective** drop-down then select an Orthographic View Mode.

## WASD Fly Controls

[INCLUDE:Engine\UI\LevelEditor\Viewports\ViewportControls#GameControls]

## Orbit, Dolly, and Track

[INCLUDE:Engine\UI\LevelEditor\Viewports\ViewportControls#MayaLikeControls]

## End Result

You should now have an understanding of the different methods you can use to navigate the Viewport and have found one that you are comfortable with using to move the camera around in the level. 
You will be moving the camera around quite a bit as you are building your levels, so feel free to switch between the different methods at any point to get the precision that you need. 

In the Next Step, we will create a **New Level** so that we can build our own sample area and start populating it with assets.
