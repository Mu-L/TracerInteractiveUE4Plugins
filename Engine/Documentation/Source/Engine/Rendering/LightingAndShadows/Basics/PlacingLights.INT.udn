In Unreal Engine 4, there are a number of ways to add lights to a scene and there are a few key properties that have the greatest impact on lighting in the world.

## Placing Lights

There are a number of ways to place lights in the scene:

1. Drag one in from the **Modes** window in **Place Mode**.

		640
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:height]
		360
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
		[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
		Kb8lDTPUVxg
		[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[/OBJECT]

	Under the **Lights** tab of the **Modes** menu, **left click** on a light then drag-and-drop the light in your level 
	

You could also add a light directly from the **Level Viewport** window. 

1. **Right Click** in the viewport, select **Place Actor**, then select a light:

Once a light is added, you can then adjust the position and rotation of the light using the position (**W**) and rotation (**E**) widgets like any other object.

Lights are represented by these sprites in the editor. From left to right they are: **Point Light**, **Spot Light**, and **Directional Light**.

## Intensity

**Intensity** determines how much energy the light outputs into the scene.  

For **Point Lights** or **Spot Lights**, this is in units of lumens, where 1700 lumens corresponds to a 100W lightbulb. 

## Light Color

**Light Color** will adjust the color of the light and the sprite that represents the light in the editor will change its color to match.

## Attenuation Radius

The **Attenuation Radius** of the light does a few major things:
1. Sets the reach of the light.
1. Defines what objects it will affect.
1. Serves as the outer bounds when calculating the falloff of the light.

_**Attenuation Radius** values set above from left to right: **200**, **400** and **800**._

Light **Attenuation Radius** can have a serious impact on performance, so use larger radius values sparingly.


## Source Radius and Length

![](LI_sourceRadius.png)

**Source Radius** and **Source Length** deserve a special mention as they are what define the size of specular highlights on surfaces.

If you want to subdue this effect, check out the **Min Roughness** property on the light.

![](LI_MinRoughness.png)(w:500)

_Min Roughness values of 0.3, 0.2, and 0.1_

One last affect they have is in **Lightmass** when rendering lightmaps. Larger radius lights cast softer shadows (like area lights in most major 3D authoring packages). Since this is being processed by **Lightmass**, only **Static** lights will gain the effect.

_The red light has a **Source Radius** of 0, while the green light has a **Source Radius** of 150; note the soft shadows the green light casts_.
