Before we get started, the first thing we'll need to do is to create a new project that we can work from for the rest of this guide. 
In the steps below, we'll use Unreal Engine 4's Project Browser to create the project. After completing this step, you will have a 
template that you can build onto for your future projects. 

## Steps

1. Start by opening **Unreal Engine** from the **Epic Games Launcher**. The [Project Browser](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser/index.html) will appear.
1. Click on the **New Project** tab, then in the **Blueprint** tab, select **Third Person**. We will need to give our project a name, so we will use "Quick Start." For the purpose of this tutorial we 
will not need Starter Content, so you can set that property to **No Starter Content**. You can now click **Create Project**.

## End Result

After creating our project, and once the Unreal Editor has finished loading, you will be presented with the Main Editor Interface shown below. In the Content Browser, you will see various 
folders for the Blueprint Third Person Template that we will use in the next steps.

In the next step, we will start by setting up a new Physics Asset for our Third Person Character that will be used for our Capsule Shadows.
