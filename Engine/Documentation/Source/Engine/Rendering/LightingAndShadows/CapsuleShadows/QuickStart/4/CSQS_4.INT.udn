 In the previous step, you assigned the Physics Asset to your character in the Skeleton Editor as its Shadow Physics Asset, which, in this step, will enable you to 
 use Capsule Shadowing for your character in directly and indirectly lit areas when enabled.

## Steps

1. Inside the **Content Browser**, use the folder hierarchy to navigate to the **ThirdPersonBP** > **Blueprints** folder. Select the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint, and double-click to open it.

1. When the Blueprint Editor opens, use the **Components** window, and select **Mesh (Inherited)**. Then, in the **Details** panel, scroll down and locate the **Lighting** tab. Under the advanced rollout, locate and 
enable the following:

	* **Capsule Direct Shadows**
	* **Capsule Indirect Shadows**

1. With Capsule Shadows enabled for Direct and Indirect lighting, you can **Save** & **Close** the ThirdPersonCharacter Blueprint. 

1. Before we can fully test Capsule Shadows, you'll need to create some indirectly lit areas in your level to use Capsule Indirect Shadows. From your Level Viewport, select the **Floor** Actor,
and then hold down the **ALT** key while left-clicking to drag a copy up along the Z-axis (Blue). Move the floor Actor to the top of the outer walls, and then use the X-axis (Red) on the translation tool to move
it back, so that only part of the floor is covered. This will give you an area that uses indirect lighting when you rebuild the lighting for the scene.

1. Now, select the **Direcitonal Light**, named "Light Source", from the **World Outliner**. In its **Details** panel, set the **Intensity** for the light to **10**. This will make sure there is enough light to illuminate the area being covered.

1. From the Main Toolbar, click the **Build** button so that lighting will be rebuilt for the scene. This ensures that you will be able to use Capsule Indirect Shadows for your character.

## End Result

You now have a character that supports Capsule Shadowing when in direct and indirect lighting. You can **Play in Editor** (PIE) to move your character around the scene to see how the soft shadows look.

You can enable both Capsule Shadow settings individually, such that, if you don't need the soft shadowing while your character is lit in open areas, you can disable this
option and leave only Capsule Indirect Shadow enabled for these areas that are indirectly lit. 

In the final step, there are some challenges you can attempt on your own, along with reminders for creating a Shadow Physics Asset.
