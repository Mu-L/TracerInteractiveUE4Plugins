[EXCERPT:LightFunctions]
**Light Functions** are - in essence - a Material that can be applied to filter a light's intensity.  

[Region:note]
It should be noted, however, that you cannot change the color of lights using a Light Function, only the Light Color setting can do that. Also, Static Lights cannot not use Light Functions, as this feature is only available for non-lightmapped lights, like Stationary and Movable lights.
