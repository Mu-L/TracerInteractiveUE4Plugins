## Building

1. Click **Build** ![](LI_Build.png) on the menu bar (you can use the little down triangle next to the build button and select **Build Lighting** if you so choose).

1. A dialog like this will appear at the bottom right of the screen.

And that is it. Depending on the number of lights, quality mode, the size of the level, what portions are contained within a Lightmass Importance Volume, and if other computers are available for the Swarm client to use, this process could take a few minutes or possibly substantially longer.

## Quality Modes

These presets are about time versus quality. The **Preview** setting will render quickly and will give an ok representation of most baked direct lighting, while the **Production** setting renders more slowly, but gives a more realistic look while also correcting for various light bleed errors.

* **Production** - Looks awesome, takes a while.
* **High** - Looks good, takes some time.
* **Medium** - Looks better, takes a bit longer to calculate.
* **Preview** - Gets the point across, but at least it is fast.


These are just the presets, there are a vast number of settings that can be tweaked to get the desired lighting for your game. See the [**Lightmass**](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass) documentation for more info on how to fine tune **Lightmass** settings.
