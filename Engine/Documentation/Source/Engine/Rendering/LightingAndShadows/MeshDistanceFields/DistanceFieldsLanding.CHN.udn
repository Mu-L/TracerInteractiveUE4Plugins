Distance Fields are a powerful system that can be used for a variety of features in Unreal Engine 4 and have been used for major features, like dynamic Ambient Occlusion and Shadows. 
These two features are heavily used in Epic's own games, like Fortnite. Distance Fields have also been extended for use with particle collision, dynamic indirect area shadows, and Materials, which
enables you to create dynamic effects for soft bodies or dynamic flow maps for water. 

Before you can get started using Distance Fields features, you'll first need to enable it for your project(s). 

## Enabling Mesh Distance Fields for your Project

1. Navigate to the menu and select **Edit** > **Project Settings** to open the project options window.

	[REGION:note]
	Mesh Distance Fields are only built if a Static Mesh is currently in your level that is loaded, when a Static Mesh is opened the Static Mesh Editor for the first time, or if its Distance Field Resolution is changed via the 
	Build Settings in the Static Mesh Editor.

1. Once Distance Fields are built, you can use the visualization mode to see their representation by going to **Show** > **Visualize** > **Mesh Distance Fields** in the main viewport.
