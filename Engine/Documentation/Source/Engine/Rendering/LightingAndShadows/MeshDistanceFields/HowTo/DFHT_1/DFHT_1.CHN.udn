When you're developing your game(s), you may find that there are situations where you can only efficiently use dynamic lighting for your scenes, like in a large open world where precomputed lighting just 
wouldn't make a whole lot of sense. **Ray Traced Distance Field Soft Shadows**, also referred to simply as **Distance Field Shadows**, enables you to have shadowing at farther distances than traditional 
Cascaded Shadow Maps (CSM) with a Directional Light would. For open world games or even just long view distances, Distance Field Shadows can efficiently shadow beyond the CSM distance. This method was 
used extensively in the Open World Demo "A Boy and His Kite", which you can download from the Epic Games Launcher via the Learn tab. 

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to enable Distance Field Shadows for your light types and then explore the various settings that you can use with them.


## Steps

[REGION:note]
This feature requires that **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** be enabled in your **Project Settings** in the **Rendering** section.
[/REGION]

1. Start by navigating to the **Modes** window, then in the **Lights** section, select and drag a **Directional**, **Spot**, or **Point** Light into the main viewport. 

	![](ModesPanelLights.png)(w:400)
	
	[REGION:note]
	For the purpose of enabling Distance Field Shadows on any Light Actor, the process is the same. The additional sections of this guide will cover specific properties for these light types.
	[/REGION]

1. With the Light Actor selected, navigate over to its **Details** panel and set its **Mobility** to **Movable**.

1. Now, scroll down in the **Details** panel and under the **Distance Field Shadows** section, toggle the option for **RayTraced Distance Field Shadows**.

	[Region:imagetable]
	|![](DirectionalLightDFSettings.png)(w:450)|![](PointSpotLightSettingsDF.png)(w:450)|
	|---|---|
	| Directional Light | Spot/Point Light |
	[/Region]
	
	[REGION:note]
	If this option if grayed out, make sure that the light is set to **Movable** or that you've first enabled the option for **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** in your Project's Settings.
	[/REGION]
	
1. 	Now, Distance Field Shadows will be enabled for your lights that have this setting toggled on. Try dragging in a few Static Meshes from the Content Browser to see Distance Field Shadows working in your game.

	[REGION:tip]
	When using a Directional Light, it can be helpful to set the **Dynamic Shadow Distance Moveable Light** slider to **0**. This will disable Cascaded Shadow Maps (CSM) so that you will only see the
	Distance Field Shadow of a mesh. This is also useful for testing in your scene and diagnosing any potential Distance Field issues in addition to using the visualization mode for Mesh Distance Fields that you can
	enable in the main viewport by going to **Show** > **Visualize** > **Mesh Distance Fields**.

## Light Source Settings

When you decide on the type of light you want to use, whether it's a **Directional**, **Spot**, or **Point** Light, you will have different options that are avaialble. Below you'll find these settings that you can adjust
and how to you use them for your Distance Field Shadows.

### Directional Light

Here you'll find the various settings that are available for your **Directional** Lights that have Distance Field Shadows enabled.

![Distance Field Shadow Settings](DirectionalLightSettings.png)

[REGION:simpletable]
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| [REGION:tablesection]Light[/REGION] ||
| Light Source Angle | This is the light source's angle in degrees and is used to support soft area shadows for dynamic shadowing methods using Distance Fields or Capsule Shadows. | 
| [REGION:tablesection]Distance Field Shadows[/REGION] ||
| DistanceField Shadow Distance | This is the farthest distance that will have Distance Field Shadowing. Distance Field Shadows will also cover the distance between this value and the **Dynamic Shadow Distance Movable Light** for CSM shadows. | 
| RayTraced DistanceField Shadows | This will toggle Distance Field Shadows on for the light source. | 
| Distance Field Trace Distance  | This sets a distance in world units for how far shadows can cast. When using larger values you will increase the shadowing cost for the scene. |
| Ray Start Offset Depth Scale | Controls how large of an offset ray traced shadows have from the receiving surface as the camera gets further away. This can be useful to hide self-shadowing artifacts from low-resolution distance fields on huge static meshes. | 
[/REGION]

#### Cascaded Shadow Maps VS Distance Field Shadows

In this example, we'll look at the difference between Cascaded Shadow Maps and Distance Field Shadows on a Directional Light. CSM shadows provide higher quality shadows but don't work well for large view distances, whereas 
Distance Fields can shadow over much farther distances more efficiently. It's a good idea to use both methods with your Directional Light and find a distance trade off for CSM shadowing for objects close to the camera and 
then using Distance Field Shadows for objects beyond the CSM distance.

	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

#### Light Source Angle

The **Light Source Angle** of a Directional Light will soften or sharpen the shadows based on the rotational angle of the light and the value entered. This setting only works with Distance Fields and Capsule Shadows and will not 
work with traditional dynamic shadowing where the shadow cannot easily be blurred. 

In this example, the Light Source Angle is set to 0, where you'll see that the shadows are really sharp and crisp, while the default value of 1 is used you get soft shadows that spread out the farther
they extend along the receiving surface.

	![Light Source Angle: 0](DF_LSA0.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Light Source Angle: 1](DF_LSA1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


#### Distance Field Trace Distance

The  **Distance Field Trace Distance** controls how far a ray trace for shadowing can extend for any shadow caster. If you lower the value for the trace distance you lower the cost of shadow casting for the scene, 
because shadows will not draw beyond that point from their source. However, this trace distance does not affect the shadow distance from the camera's view, which is controlled by **Distance Field Shadow Distance**.

In this example, the tree is casting a shadow along the ground using it's Mesh Distance Field. When using a lower trace distance of 1500 units, vs the default value of 10000, you can see that the trees shadow doesn't 
capture the top details of the tree any longer since it's more than 1500 units from the receiving surface.

### Point/Spot Lights
 
 Here you'll find the various settings that are available for your **Spot** and **Point** Lights that have Distance Field Shadows enabled.

[REGION:simpletable]
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------| 
| [REGION:tablesection]Light[/REGION] ||
| Source Radius | This is used as the size of the light source sphere. When you use larger values you get a larger penumbra, but it will cost more performance. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Distance Field Shadows[/REGION] ||
| RayTraced DistanceField Shadows | Whether to use ray traced distance field area shadows. | 
| Ray Start Offset Depth Scale | Controls how large of an offset ray traced shadows have from the receiving surface as the camera gets further away. This can be useful to hide self-shadowing artifacts from low-resolution distance fields on huge static meshes. | 
[/REGION]

#### Traditional Shadow Maps VS Distance Field Shadows

In this example, the default shadows from a Point Light are very sharp versus Distance Field Shadows, which can use the **Source Radius** of the light to control how soft the shadows are. 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Default Shadow Map](PointLight_CSM.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Distance Field Shadow](PointLight_DF.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Source Radius

The **Source Radius**, similar to the Light Source Angle in a Directional Light, is used to soften the area shadows by adjusting the size of the light source itself. 

In this example, the sharpness and softness of the shadow is controlled by adjusting the **Source Radius**, where lower values will make the shadows sharper and a larger radius will soften the shadows the farther they stretch out
from the shadow caster. 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Source Radius: 0.1](DF_LightSource1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Source Radius: 20](DF_LightSource2.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Ray Start Offset Depth Scale

In some cases, low resolution Distance Fields or more complex geometry will produce self-shadowing artifacts. This can sometimes be offset by adjusting the **Distance Field Resolution** of your mesh, but you may not want to pay 
the higher cost of the generated volume texture that would be required. Instead, you can use the **Ray Start Offset Depth Scale** to control where the ray starts for shadows from the receiving surface as the camera moves further away. 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Ray Start Offset Depth Scale: 0](DF_Depth0.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Ray Start Offset Depth Scale: 0.01](DF_Depth1.png)(w:600)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


## End Result

Now that you've enabled Distance Fields Shadows for your different light types in your level and seen how to adjust the various settings for them, you should be able to apply these concepts to your own levels and games
using Distance Fields.
