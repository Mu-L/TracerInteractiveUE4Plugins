In your games, you may rely on screen space techniques to provide Ambient Occlusion (AO) or even precomputed lighting to make objects feel grounded in the world. These techniques are very useful, but have their
own limitations. Screen space ambient occlusion (SSAO) is limited to using scene depth, which is limited to what's visible on screen and precomputed methods only work for static objects in the world.
**Distance Field Ambient Occlusion** (DFAO) is a fully dynamic AO method using Mesh Distance Fields for your Static Mesh Actors and is not limited to only being used in dynamically lit worlds. It can easily be 
used with precomputed lighting as well. For additional information, you can read about [Distance Field Ambient Occlusion](Engine/Rendering/LightingandShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion) in more detail here.

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to enable DFAO with a Movable Sky Light Actor and then explore the various settings that you can use.


## Steps

[REGION:note]
This feature requires that **Generate Mesh Distance Fields** be enabled in your **Project Settings** in the **Rendering** section.
[/REGION]

1. Start by navigating to the **Modes** window, then in the **Lights** section, select and drag a **Sky Light** Actor into your Level Viewport.

1. With the Sky Light selected, navigate over to its **Details** panel and set its **Mobility** to **Movable**.

1. Now, Distance Field Ambient Occlusion will automatically be enabled for your scene. You can find the settings for **Distance Field Ambient Occlusion** in the Skylight's **Details** panel.

## Visualizing Distance Field Ambient Occlusion

To help you better see DFAO in action in your scene and to help you troubleshoot or diagnose issues, you can use the visualization view mode by going to the main viewport and selecting **Show** > **Visualize** > **Distance Field Ambient Occlusion**.
Like other view modes, your viewport will change so that you can see the DFAO representation of your level.

## Distance Field Ambient Occlusion Settings

In the Sky Light Details panel under **Distance Field Ambient Occlusion**, you'll find the settings available for artistic control of DFAO in your level.
 
 ![](DFAOProperties.png)(w:450)
 
| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| Occlusion Max Distance | This is the maximum distance that the occlusion of one point will affect another. By using higher values you increase the cost of DFAO exponentially, but, in return, you get occlusion at a farther distance. |
| Contrast | This applies a contrast S-curve to the computed AO. A value of 0 means no contrast increase, whereas 1 is a significant contrast increase. | 
| Min Occlusion | This controls the darkest that a fully occluded area can get. | 
| Occlusion Tint | Artists can use this to control the Tint color for occluded areas. | 

### Occlusion Max Distance

The **Occlusion Max Distance** controls the distance between two points that occlusion can affect the other. When you adjust this distance, you're adjusting the accuracy that DFAO will have with 
other objects in the scene, which in-turn means you're increasing the cost of it as well. 

In this example, you can see the difference that the lowest slider range of 200 has versus the max slider range of 1500. In most cases, the default value of 1000 units should work well.

	[PARAM:before]
	![Occlusion Max Distance - 200](1_MaxOccl200.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Occlusion Max Distance - 1500](1_MaxOccl1500.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Contrast

The **Contrast** controls the difference in brightness between the objects affected by DFAO. The contrast value is clamped to be between 0 to 1, so you can use the slider to adjust the amount of contrast you will have 
in your scene for DFAO. 

In the example below, you can see the difference that the default value of 0 will have on Contrast versus the max value of 1, where these crevices and corners start to really darken. 

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]
	![Contrast - 0](1_Contrast_0.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Contrast - 1](1_Contrast_1.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

### Min Occlusion

The **Min Occlusion** controls how dark any fully occluded areas can get in your scene. This setting gives extra control to Artists to lighten DFAO in the occluded areas by using a higher value between 0 and 1.

In the example below, you can see the difference between the default value of 0 and how much the occlusion has been lightened using a value of 1, where it really starts to lighten the effect. This can work well with 
the Contrast setting where you can darken areas and then use the Min Occlusion to better control how dark these areas are.

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Min Occlusion - 1](1_MinOccl_1.png)(w:700)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]


### Occlusion Tint

The **Occlusion Tint** affords Artists the most control over the look of DFAO by enabling the tint color for occluded areas to be adjusted. 

In the example below, The default color of black is used for the Occlusion Tint versus full red value. Any occlusion areas will be tinted based on these color values.

you can see the default color of black is used for the Occlusion Tint versus a red color value. Any areas that are occluded will be tinted based on these color values.

## End Result

Now that you've enabled Distance Field Ambient Occlusion for your level and seen how to adjust the various settings for it in your Sky Light, you should be able to control and tweak DFAO to fit your own 
games and levels for your stylistic needs.
