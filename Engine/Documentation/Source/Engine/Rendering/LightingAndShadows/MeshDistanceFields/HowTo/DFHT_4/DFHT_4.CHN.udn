When your games rely on precomputed lighting with nice indirectly lit areas, it can be a challenge to have nice soft shadowing for your dynamic objects that isn't faked by using a decal or some complex
material setup. To solve this problem, **Distance Field Indirect Shadows** (DFIS) enables your dynamic Static Meshes to have soft area shadows in these indirectly lit areas where traditional shadow mapping 
techniques wouldn't work. Distance Field Indirect Shadows, similarly how Capsule Shadows for Skeletal Meshes, samples the [indirect lighting cache](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/IndirectLightingCache/)
to get the directionality and intensity of the indirect lighting and then uses the Mesh Distance Field to cast a soft area shadow.

In this guide, we'll take a look at how to enable Distance Fields for meshes that can then be used in your levels for dynamic indirect shadowing.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
Unlike other Distance Field features, like those for [Ray Traced Distance Field Shadows](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/RayTracedDistanceFieldShadowing) and [Ambient Occlusion](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/DistanceFieldAmbientOcclusion),
this feature can be enabled per-mesh, which is detailed in the steps below.

1. In the **Content Browser**, start by selecting any **Static Mesh** asset and double-clicking to open the Static Mesh Editor.

	For the purpose of this example, the Static Mesh **SM_Statue** from Sun Temple project (available on the Epic Games Launcher) will be used for the remainder of this demonstration.
	[/REGION]
1. In the Static Mesh Editor, navigate to the **Details** panel and in the **Static Mesh Settings** section, toggle the option for **Generate Mesh Distance Fields**. After enabling this, you can **Save** & **Close** the Editor window.

1. Now, go back to the **Content Browser**, where you selected the asset, and drag it into the Level Viewport.

1. With the Actor selected in your level, go to the **Details** panel and set the **Mobility** to **Movable**.

	Then, under the **Lighting** section, toggle the option for **Distance Field Indirect Shadow**.

1.	Once you've toggled the **Distance Field Indirect Shadows** option, you're Static Mesh Actor will cast a soft area shadow when in precomputed indirectly lit areas. With your own Static Mesh, you should see similar results as the example below.
	
	[REGION:note]
	If you're not seeing a soft shadow or drastically differing results, first make sure that you've already built lighting for the level and that you're testing in an area that gets a good amount of bounce light. In very brightly lit
	areas or areas in directly lit by the light source, the indirect shadows will practically non-existent.

### Distance Field Indirect Shadow Min Visibility

![](DFISMinVisibilitySetting.png)(w:450)

The setting for **Distance Field Indirect Shadow Min Visibility** controls how dark the movable Actor's indirect shadow can be. This setting enables artists to have control over how dark the 
shadows can be in indirectly lit areas. When you use a higher value the indirect shadow will lighten enabling them to blend with any of the precomputed shadows more easily.

	![Min Visibility: 0.1 ](DFISMinVisibility_1.png)(w:550)
	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![Min Visibility: 0.6 ](DFISMinVisibility_2.png)(w:550)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

	
	
## End Result

Now that you've seen how to use Distance Field Indirect Shadows, you should be able to enable your own Static Meshes to use dynamic indirect shadowing in your levels and individual actors, along with being able to 
adjust the shadows to blend nicely with your surrounding baked lighting in indirectly lit areas.
