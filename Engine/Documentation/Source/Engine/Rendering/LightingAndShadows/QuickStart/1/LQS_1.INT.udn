[REGION:note]
For this tutorial series, we are using a new **Blank** project with **Starter Content** enabled. Please see the [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) page for information on creating new projects, using templates and defining project settings (including **Starter Content**).

Inside your **Blank** project (with **Starter Content**), follow the steps below to create our simple apartment we will use to light. 

1.	With your project open press **Ctrl+N** to create a new level, then select **Empty Level**. 

1.	Inside the **Content Browser** under the **StarterContent > Architecture** folder, drag a **Floor_400x400** into the level.

1.	Inside the **World Outliner**, select the floor and press **Ctrl+W** 6 times to create the floors shown below.

1.	Set the **Transform** for the remaining floor pieces as shown in the table below. 

	| Floor Piece | Transform |
	| ------- | ------------ |
	| **400x401** | ![](setup4.png) |
	| **400x402** | ![](setup5.png) |
	| **400x403** | ![](setup6.png) |
	| **400x404** | ![](setup8.png) |
	| **400x405** | ![](setup9.png) |
	| **400x406** | ![](setup10.png)|

	With all the floor pieces added, you should now have a floor and roof as shown below.

	![](setup36.png)

1.	Select the **Wall_400x405**, then in the **Content Browser** select the **Wall_Window_400x400** and assign it to the wall in the level.

	You should now have two doorways and a window. 

Our simple apartment is complete with a small bathroom and an opening for a patio. In the **Next Step** we will begin lighting it.
