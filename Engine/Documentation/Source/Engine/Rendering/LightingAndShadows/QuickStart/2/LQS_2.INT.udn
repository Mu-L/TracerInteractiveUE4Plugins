With our basic apartment setup created in the previous step, we will now add the overall level lighting. 

1. First (if you've enabled it), let's disable **Wireframe** mode and return to **Lit** mode (press **Alt+4**). 

	![](step2_1.png)

1. Inside the **Modes** menu under **Visual Effects**, drag an **Atmospheric Fog** into the level viewport. 

	![](step2_2.png)

	After doing so, your level should have a simple skybox and sunset lighting. 

1. Inside the **Modes** menu under **Lights**, drag a **Directional Light** into the level viewport.

	After adding the light, you will notice that the text **Preview** appears inside our room. 

	![](step2_4.png)

	This indicates that you are seeing a preview of the actual lighting that will appear in-game once we **Build** and run the game. 

1. In the **Details** panel for the **Directional Light**, set its **Transform** as shown below and check the **Atmosphere Sun Light** checkbox.

	With **Atmosphere Sun Light** checked, we can control the location of the sun using **Rotation** mode (**E**) and rotating our light.

	The lighting in our level changes based on the location of the sun allowing us to easily switch between various times of day. 

Currently our default lighting looks like this:

Let's change some settings on our **Directional Light** to create a warmer sunset feel. 

1. In the **Details** panel for the **Directional Light**, click the **Light Color** bar and a **Color Picker** will appear. 

	![](LightingColorPicker.png)(w:640)

	You can also instead, manually enter **RGB** values by clicking the expand icon. 

	![](step2_11.png)

	Set the **RGB** as shown above. 

Let's **Build** the game so that we get a better representation of what our light will look like in the game. 

1. From the **Main Toolbar**, click the **Build** icon. 

	![](step2_12.png)

	In the bottom-right corner of the Editor, you will see that the Build process has begun. 

	![](step2_13.png)

	Wait until it says that it has completed. 

	![](step2_14.png)

	Our lighting has been built and the preview text disappears.

	Anytime you add/move your lights or geometry in the level you will need to rebuild the lighting to get an accurate representation.

With our atmospheric lighting set up, in the **Next Step** we'll add some lights inside our apartment to light up the dark areas.
