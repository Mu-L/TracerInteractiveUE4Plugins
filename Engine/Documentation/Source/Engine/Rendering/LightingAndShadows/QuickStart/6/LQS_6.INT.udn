With our apartment almost complete, next we will create a more advanced **Point Light** that uses an **IES Profile** which is a lighting industry standard method of diagramming the brightness and falloff of light as it exits a particular real world light fixture.  

[REGION:note]
	For more information, refer to the [IES Light Profiles](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/IESLightProfiles) documentation.

1.	Click on the **Point Light** in the small bathroom. 

1.	In the **Details** panel for the Point Light, click the **None** dropdown under **Light Profile**.

	Unreal Engine 4 provides some example IES Light Profiles to use, but you can find others from the internet and import them as well. 

1.	Select the **Complex_IES** profile.

1.	We'll need to update the **Transform** of the light to fully see its effect, set the following new **Transform**.

1.	Click **Build** to build your lighting.

	While we don't have a light fixture attached, you can see how the light now bends coming out of the Point Light. 

In the **Next Step** and final of this guide, you will see some examples of things to try on your own as well as links to additional lighting documentation, samples and techniques.
