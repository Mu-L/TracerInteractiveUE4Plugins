Shadows make objects feel grounded in the world and give the viewer a sense of depth and space. Static shadows are free as far as rendering goes, but dynamic shadows can be one of the biggest drains on performance. This document covers the basics of the 4 types of shadow casting you can have in Unreal Engine 4.

## Static Lights

[EXCERPT:StaticLightShadows]
Static lights cast completely static shadows and light, meaning they will have no _direct_ effect on dynamic objects (static lights are baked into the Indirect Lighting Cache so they have _some_ effect) like on the bronze men below.

_The bronze character on the left is standing in the light of a static light, it does not affect him in any way (lighting or shadows) while the one on the right is in the light of a stationary light_.

## Directional Light Cascading Shadow Maps (Whole Scene Shadows)

## Stationary Light Shadows

## Dynamic Shadows

Movable lights cast completely dynamic shadows (and light) on everything. None of its light data will get baked into the light maps and it will be free to cast dynamic shadows on everything. Static Meshes, Skeletal Meshes, effects, etc... will all cast and receive dynamic shadows from a movable light.

On average, movable dynamic shadow casting lights are the most expensive.


## Preview Shadows
When editing a Stationary or Static Light in such a way that the lighting becomes un-built, **Preview Shadowing** is enabled to give you an idea of what the shadows will look like when lighting is rebuilt. 

These shadows are shown in the editor with the text "Preview" to distinguish them from pre-existing shadows as seen below.

If you test your game in the editor prior to rebuilding lighting, the Preview Shadows will disappear as the preview only exists within the editor and not during Play In Editor.

In order to generate shadows from the Preview Shadows, you will need to select **Build Lighting** from the **Build** option off the Main Editor Tool Bar.

You can disable Preview Shadows by un-checking the **Preview Shadows Indicator** option in the Viewport's **Show/Visualize** menu.

## All Together

When all the shadows are brought together, each bringing their strengths to make up for the weakness of the others, impressive and rapidly rendered visuals can be brought to life.
