## LightmapUVs

The **LightmapUVs** expression outputs the lightmap UV texture coordinates in the form of a two-channel vector value. If lightmap UVs are unavailable, it will output a two-channel vector value of (0,0).

## ObjectRadius

The **Object Radius** outputs a value equal to the radius of a given object in Unreal units. Scaling is taken into account and the results can be unique for each individual object.

In this example, both meshes are receiving this material in which the ObjectRadius is fed into Diffuse. The ObjectRadius output is being divided by 512 to provide a more meaningful visual result.

## Panner

The **Panner** expression outputs UV texture coordinates that can be used to create panning, or moving, textures.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **SpeedX** | Specifies the speed to pan the coordinates in the U direction. |
| **SpeedY** | Specifies the speed to pan the coordinates in the V direction. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Coordinate** | Takes in base UV texture coordinates the expression can then modify. |
| **Time** | Takes in a value used to determine the current panning position. This is usually a [Time](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant#Time) expression to provide a constant panning effect, but a [Constant](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant#Constant) or [ScalarParameter](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Parameters#ScalarParameter) can be used as well to set a specific offset or to control the panning through Matinee or Blueprints. |


Panner generates UVs that change according to the Time input.  The Coordinate input can be used to manipulate (e.g. offset) the UVs generated by the Panner node.

## Rotator

The **Rotator** expression outputs UV texture coordinates in the form of a two-channel vector value that can be used to create rotating textures.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **CenterX** | Specifies the U coordinate to use as the center of the rotation. |
| **CenterY** | Specifies the V coordinate to use as the center of the rotation. |
| **Speed** | Specifies the speed to rotate the coordinates clockwise. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Coordinate** | Takes in base UV texture coordinates the expression can then modify. |
| **Time** | Takes in a value used to determine the current rotation position. This is usually a [Time](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant#Time) expression to provide a constant rotation effect, but a [Constant](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant#Constant) or [ScalarParameter](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Parameters#ScalarParameter) can be used as well to set a specific offset or to control the rotation through Matinee or Blueprints. |

## SceneTexelSize

The **SceneTexelSize** expression allows you to offset by texel sizes, as you would when using the SceneColor and SceneDepth expressions. This is useful for edge detection in multi-resolution systems, as without this calculation you would be forced to use a small static value, resulting in inconsistent results at lower resolutions.

## ScreenPosition

The **ScreenPosition** expression outputs the screen-space position of the pixel currently being rendered.  

[COMMENT:none]
| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Screen Align** | If true, ScreenPosition divides the position by the homogeneous coordinate and maps the position to [0,0] - [1,1] for screen alignment. |

## TextureCoordinate

The **TextureCoordinate** expression outputs UV texture coordinates in the form of a two-channel vector value allowing materials to use different UV channels, specify tiling, and otherwise operate on the UVs of a mesh.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Coordinate Index** | Specifies the UV channel to use. |
| **UTiling** | Specifies the amount of tiling in the U direction. |
| **VTiling** | Specifies the amount of tiling in the V direction. |
| **Un Mirror U** | If _true_, undo any mirroring in the U direction. |
| **Un Mirror V** | If _true_, undo any mirroring in the V direction. |


**Example Usage:** To access the second UV channel of a mesh, create a TextureCoordinate node, set its CoordinateIndex to 1 (0 - first channel, 1 - second channel, etc), and connect it to the UVs input of a TextureSample node.

## ViewSize
 
 The **ViewSize** expression outputs a 2D vector giving the size of the current view in pixels. This is useful for causing various changes in your materials based on the current resolution of the screen.

| :---: | :---: |
| Preview Window Size: 740x700 | Preview Window Size: 740x280 |
[/REGION]

 In this example, ViewSize is being fed into Base Color. The result is divided by 2,400 to provide a more meaningful result.


[EXCERPT:WorldPosition]
## WorldPosition


The **WorldPosition** expression outputs the position of the current pixel in world space. To visualize, simply plug the output into Emissive:

[/REGION]

Common uses are to find the radial distance from the camera to a pixel (as opposed to the orthogonal distance from PixelDepth).  WorldPosition is also useful to use as a texture coordinate and have unrelated meshes using the texture coord match up when they are near each other.  Here is a basic example of using WorldPosition.xy to planar map a texture:
