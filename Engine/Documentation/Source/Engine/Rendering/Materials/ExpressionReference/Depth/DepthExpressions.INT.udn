[EXCERPT:DepthFade]
## DepthFade

The **DepthFade** expression is used to hide unsightly seams that take place when translucent objects intersect with opaque ones. 

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Fade Distance** | World space distance over which the fade should take place. This is used if the FadeDistance input is unconnected. | 
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Opacity** | Takes in the existing opacity for the object prior to the depth fade. |
| **FadeDistance** | World space distance over which the fade should take place. |

## PixelDepth

The **PixelDepth** expression outputs the depth, or distance from the camera, of the pixel currently being rendered.

[/COMMENT]

In this example, the material network has been applied to the floor. Notice how the linear interpolation blends between the two colors as the floor recedes beyond 2048 units. A Power expression was used to boost the contrast between the two colors and yield a more meaningful visual result.

## SceneDepth

The **SceneDepth** expression outputs the existing scene depth.  This is similar to [PixelDepth](#PixelDepth), except that PixelDepth can sample the depth only at the pixel currently being drawn, whereas SceneDepth can sample depth at **any location**.

[REGION:warning]
	Only translucent materials may utilize SceneDepth.

| **UVs** | Takes in UV texture coordinates used to determine how the depth "texture" is sampled. |

In this example, we have applied the material network to a translucent sphere. Notice how the SceneDepth node is reading the pixels behind the sphere, rather than the ones on its surface.

[REGION:note]
**Programmers:** SceneDepth returns a raw depth value (integer from 0 to 2^24-1).  This non-linear depth can be normalized as follows:
      
    MaxZ = 16777215
	NormalizedDepth = 1 - MaxZ / (SceneDepth + MaxZ)

[/REGION]

[/COMMENT]
The resulting normalized depth is linear in the 0.0 to 1.0 range.
