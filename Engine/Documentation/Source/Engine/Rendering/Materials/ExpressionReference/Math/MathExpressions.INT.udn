## Abs

**Abs** is an abbreviation for the mathematical term "absolute value".  The Abs expression outputs the absolute, or unsigned, value of the input it receives. Essentially, this means it turns negative numbers into positive numbers by dropping the minus sign, while positive numbers and zero remain unchanged.

**Examples:** Abs of -0.7 is 0.7; Abs of -1.0 is 1.0; Abs of 1.0 is also 1.0

**Example Usage:** Abs is commonly used with [DotProduct](#DotProduct).  DotProduct goes from -1..0..1, while taking the Abs of DotProduct will go from 1..0..1.

## Add

The **Add** expression takes two inputs, adds them together and outputs the result.  This addition operation is performed on a per channel basis, meaning that the inputs' R channels get added, G channels get added, B channels get added, etc. Both inputs must have the same number of channels unless one of them is a single Constant value. Constants can be added to a vector with any number of inputs.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const A** | Takes in the value(s) to add to. Only used if the A input is not used.|
| **Const B** | Takes in the value(s) to be added. Only used if the B input is not used. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in the value(s) to add to. |
| **B** | Takes in the value(s) to be added. |


**Examples:** Add of 0.2 and 0.4 is 0.6; Add of (0.2,-0.4,0.6) and (0.1,0.5,1.0) is (0.3,0.1,1.6); Add of (0.2,-0.4,0.6) and 1.0 is (1.2,0.6,1.6)

**Example Usage:** Add is often used to brighten/darken colors or to offset UV texture coordinates.

## Ceil

The **Ceil** expression takes in value(s), rounds them **up** to the next integer, and outputs the result.  See also [Floor](#Floor) and [Frac](#Frac).

**Examples:** Ceil of 0.2 is 1.0; Ceil of (0.2,1.6) is (1.0,2.0).

![CeilExample.png](CeilExample.png)(w:900)


## Clamp

The **Clamp** expression takes in value(s) and constrains them to a specified range, defined by a minimum and maximum value.  A minimum value of 0.0 and maximum value of 0.5 means that the resulting value(s) will never be less than 0.0 and never greater than 0.5.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Clamp Mode** | Selects the type of clamp to be used. CMODE_Clamp will clamp both ends of the range. CMODE_ClampMin and CMODE_ClampMax will only clamp their respective ends of the range.
| **Min Default** | Takes in the value to use as the minimum when clamping. Only used when the Min input is unused. |
| **Max Default** | Takes in the value to use as the maximum when clamping. Only used when the Max input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Min** | Takes in the value to use as the minimum when clamping. |
| **Max** | Takes in the value to use as the maximum when clamping. |


**Examples:** Clamping an input range of (0.0) to (1.0) 0.3 with Min 0.0 and Max 1.0 yields 0.3; Clamping 1.3 with Min 0.0 and Max 1.0 yields 1.0.

[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/VectorOps#ComponentMask]


## Cosine

The **Cosine** expression outputs the value of a cosine wave over the input range of [0, 1] and the output range of [-1, 1], both repeating. Most commonly, this is used to output a continuous oscillating waveform by connecting a [Time](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant#Time) expression to its input, but it can also be used to create ripples in worldspace or screenspace, or any other application where a continuous, smooth cycle is needed. A visual representation of the wave is shown below, scaled to the [0, 1] output range:

![CosineWave.png](CosineWave.png)

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Period** | Specifies the period of the resultant wave. In other words, this is how long one oscillation takes to occur. |


**Example Usage:** This expression is useful anytime an oscillating effect is needed. The speed and amplitude of the oscillation can easily be controlled dynamically by multiplying the time input (speed) or the output (amplitude).

![CosineExample.png](CosineExample.png)

In the example above, the color would oscillate with co-sinusoidal frequency.


[EXCERPT:CrossProduct]
## CrossProduct

The **CrossProduct** expression computes the cross product of two three-channel vector value inputs and outputs the resulting three-channel vector value. Given two vectors in space, the cross product is a vector that is perpendicular to both of the inputs.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in a three-channel vector value. |
| **B** | Takes in a three-channel vector value. |


**Example Usage:** CrossProduct is often used to compute directions which are perpendicular to two other directions.

![CrossProductExample.png](CrossProductExample.png)

[/EXCERPT:CrossProduct]


## Divide

The **Divide** expression takes two inputs and outputs the result of the first divided by the second. The division happens per channel, meaning that the R channel of the first is divided by the second, the G channel of the first is divided by the second, and so on. Both inputs must have the same number of values unless the divisor is a single float value. Division by zero in any channel will result in that channel containing the local hardware's "infinity" implementation, which is usually a very large, positive value.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const A** | Takes in the value(s) to be divided, the dividend. Only used if the A input is unused. |
| **Const B** | Takes in the value(s) to divide by, the divisor. Only used if the B input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in the value(s) to be divided, the dividend. |
| **B** | Takes in the value(s) to divide by, the divisor. |


**Examples:** Using Divide with A=(1.0) and B=(5.0) outputs (0.2), which appears as a dark gray.

![DivideExample.png](DivideExample.png)


[EXCERPT:DotProduct]
## DotProduct

The **DotProduct** expression computes the dot product, which can be described as the length of one vector projected onto the other, or as the cosine between the two vectors multiplied by their magnitudes. This calculation is used by many techniques for computing falloff.  DotProduct requires both vector inputs to have the same number of channels.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in a value or vector of any length. |
| **B** | Takes in a value or vector of the same length as **A**. |


![DotProductExample.png](DotProductExample.png)(w:900)

[/EXCERPT:DotProduct]

## Floor

The **Floor** expression takes in value(s), rounds them **down** to the previous integer, and outputs the result.  See also [Ceil](#Ceil) and [Frac](#Frac).

**Examples:** Floor of 0.2 is 0.0; Floor of (0.2,1.6) is (0.0, 1.0).

![FloorExample.png](FloorExample.png)(w:900)


## FMod

The **FMod** expression returns the floating-point remainder of the division operation of the two inputs. The Dividend (input "A") can be any value, but negative Dividends will result in negative results. The Divisor (second input) should not be zero as this implies a division by zero, but whether the Divisor is negative or positive will not affect the result. A common use case is to make a material that brightens up to a maximum value, then immediately drops back to the minimum value on the next frame, only to begin climbing toward the maximum again.

![FModExample.png](FModExample.png)

In this example, FMod takes a zero-to-one UV progression and converts it into a repeating cycle every 0.2 UV units on the X axis in the green channel.

## Frac

The **Frac** expression takes in values and outputs the fractional portion of those values. In other words, for an input value "X", the result is "X minus Floor of X". The output value will range from zero to one, inclusive on the low end, but not the high end. See also [Ceil](#Ceil) and [Floor](#Floor).

**Examples:** Frac of (0.2) is (0.2). Frac of (-0.2) is (0.8). Frac of (0.0,1.6,1.0) is (0.0,0.6,0.0).

![FracExample.png](FracExample.png)(w:900)

In this example, the Frac node is converting time into a series of repeating 0 - 1 progressions, causing the color to fade (via the Lerp) from green to red, then snap back to green, repeating indefinitely.

[EXCERPT:If]
## If

The **If** expression compares two inputs and then passes through one of three other input values based on the result of the comparison. Both compared inputs must be single float values.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in a single float value. |
| **B** | Takes in a single float value. |
| **A > B** | Takes in the value(s) to output if the value of A is greater than the value of B. |
| **A = B** | Takes in the value(s) to output if the value of A is equal to the value of B. |
| **A &lt; B** | Takes in the value(s) to output if the value of A is less than the value of B. |


![IfExample.png](IfExample.png)(w:900)

In this example, the If expression takes in a heightmap and outputs either red or green based on whether the height falls under or over a value of 0.2.

[/EXCERPT:If]


[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Utility#LinearInterpolate]


## Max

The **Max** expression takes in two inputs and outputs the higher of the two.

This node is similar to Photoshop's Lighten. 

![](MaxExample.png)(w:720)

In the example above, A is "0" and B is "1"; therefore, "1" (white) is the resulting base color. 

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const A** | Takes in the first value(s). Used only if the A input is unused. |
| **Const B** | Takes in the second value(s). Used only if the B input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in the first value(s) to compare. |
| **B** | Takes in the second value(s) to compare. |


## Min

The **Min** expression takes in two inputs and outputs the lower of the two.

This node is similar to Photoshop's Darken. 

![](MinExample.png)(w:720)

In the example above, A is "0" and B is "1"; therefore, "0" (black) is the resulting base color.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const A** | Takes in the first value(s). Used only if the A input is unused. |
| **Const B** | Takes in the second value(s). Used only if the B input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in the first value(s) to compare. |
| **B** | Takes in the second value(s) to compare. |


## Multiply

The **Multiply** expression takes two inputs, multiplies them together, and outputs the result. Similar to Photoshop's multiply layer blend.  Multiplication happens per channel, meaning that the R channel of the first is multiplied by the R channel of the second; the G chanWnel of the first is multiplied by the G channel of the second, and so on. Both inputs must have the same number of values unless one of the values is a single float value.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const A** | Takes in the first value(s) to multiply. Used only if the A input is unused. |
| **Const B** | Takes in the second value(s) to multiply. Used only if the B input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in the first value(s) to multiply. |
| **B** | Takes in the second value(s) to multiply. |


Do not forget that materials in UE4 are not limited to [0,1].  If colors/values are greater than 1, Multiply will actually brighten colors.

**Examples:** Multiply of 0.4 and 0.5 is 0.2; Multiply of (0.2,-0.4,0.6) and (0.0,2.0,1.0) is (0.0,-0.8,0.6); Multiply of (0.2,-0.4,0.6) and 0.5 is (0.1,-0.2,0.3).

**Example Usage:** Multiply is often used to brighten or darken colors/textures.

![MultiplyExample.png](MultiplyExample.png)(w:900)


[EXCERPT:Normalize]
## Normalize

The **Normalize** expression calculates and outputs the normalized value of its input. Normalized vectors (also called "unit vectors") have an overall length of 1.0. This means each component of the input is divided by the total magnitude (length) of the vector.

**Examples:** Passing either (0,2,0) or (0,0.2,0) through Normalize will output (0,1,0). Passing (0,1,-1) through Normalize will output (0, 0.707, -0.707). The only special case is an all-zero vector, which will be unchanged.

[REGION:note]
It is not necessary to normalize an expression that plugs into the Normal material output.

[/EXCERPT:Normalize]

## OneMinus

The **OneMinus** expression takes an input value "X" and outputs "One Minus X". This operation is performed per channel.

**Examples:** OneMinus of 0.4 is 0.6; OneMinus of (0.2,0.5,1.0) is (0.8,0.5,0.0); OneMinus of (0.0,-0.4,1.6) is (1.0,1.4,-0.6).

**Example Usage:** When the input colors are in the range [0,1], OneMinus has the same effect as what is commonly called "invert" -- that is, OneMinus returns the complementary color that when added to the input will produce white.

![OneMinusExample.png](OneMinusExample.png)


## Power

The **Power** expression takes two inputs, raises Base to the Exp power, and outputs the result; in other words, Base multiplied by itself Exp times.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const Exponent** | Takes in the exponent value. Used only if the Exp input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Base** | Takes in the base value. |
| **Exp** | Takes in the exponent value. |


**Examples:** Power of Base 0.5, Exp 2.0 is 0.25.

**Example Usage:** If the colors you pass to Power are in [0,1], Power can behave as a sort of contrast adjustment, where very bright values are dimmed slightly, but darker values are decreased drastically.

![PowerExample.png](PowerExample.png)


## Round

The **Round** expression rounds the value up to the next whole number if the fractional part is greater than or equal to half, else rounds down.

[OBJECT:ComparisonSlider]
	[PARAM:before]

	[/PARAM]
	[PARAM:after]
	![After Round](RoundExample_01.png)
	[/PARAM]
[/OBJECT]

**Examples:** 
* A value of 1.1 will be Round down to a value of 1.
* A value of 1.4 will be Round down to a value of 1.
* A value of 1.5 will be Round up to a value of 2.
* A value of 1.85 will be Round up to a value of  2.

## Saturate

The **Saturate** node clamps the value between 0 and 1. The instruction cost of Saturate is almost free on most modern graphics hardware.

![](SaturateExample_00.png)

**Example Usage:** This node should be used whenever you need to clamp an output or input value between 0 and 1.

## Sine

The **Sine** expression outputs the value of a Sine wave over the input range of [0, 1] and the output range of [-1, 1], both repeating. The difference between this and the output of the [Cosine](#Cosine) expression is the output waveform is offset by one-quarter of the period, meaning that `Cos(X)` is equal to `Sin(X + 0.25)`. Most commonly, this is used to output a continuous oscillating waveform by connecting a [Time](Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Constant#Time) expression to its input, but it can also be used to create ripples in worldspace or screenspace, or any other application where a continuous, smooth cycle is needed. A visual representation of the wave is shown below, scaled to the [0, 1] output range:

![SineWave.png](SineWave.png)

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Period** | Specifies the period of the resultant wave. In other words, this is how long one oscillation takes to occur. |


**Example Usage:** This expression is useful anytime an oscillating effect is needed. The speed and amplitude of the oscillation can easily be controlled dynamically by multiplying the time input (speed) or the output (amplitude).

![SineExample.png](SineExample.png)


## SquareRoot

The **SquareRoot** expression outputs the square root of the input value. If applied to a vector, each component will be handled individually.

![SqrtExample.png](SqrtExample.png)(w:900)


## Subtract

The **Subtract** node takes in two inputs, subtracts the second input from the first, and outputs the difference.  Subtraction happens per channel, meaning that the R channel of the second input gets subtracted from the first; the G channel of the second input gets subtracted from the first, and so on. Both inputs must have the same number of channels unless the second input is a single Constant value. Constants can be subtracted from a vector with any number of inputs.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Properties[/REGION] ||
| **Const A** | Takes in the value(s) of the minuend. Used only if the A input is unused. |
| **Const B** | Takes in the value(s) of the subtrahend. Used only if the B input is unused. |
| [REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **A** | Takes in the value(s) of the minuend. |
| **B** | Takes in the value(s) of the subtrahend. |


**Examples:** Subtract of 0.5 and 0.2 is 0.3; Subtract of (0.2,-0.4,0.6) and (0.1,0.1,1.0) is (0.1,-0.5,-0.4); Subtract of (0.2,0.4,1.0) and 0.2 is (0.0,0.2,0.8).

**Example Usage:** Subtract can be used to darken colors and offset UVs.
