The Reflections functions give you a variety of ways to speed up the handling of reflection calculations in your materials.

## Reflections Functions

The following is a list of all the functions underneath the Reflections category.

### ReflectionVectorSoft

This function will soften a reflection vector based on an incoming normal map. The result is reflections that appear smoother across as surface. This is done by blending (via lerp) the normal map with a flat (0,0,1) normal map and then taking the reflection vector.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Softness (Scalar)** | Controls how much the existing normal map is smoothed, or blended with a flat normal map.|
| **Normal (Vector3)** | Takes in the incoming normal map that needs to be softened before a reflection vector is calculated.|

### ViewAlignedReflection

This function takes in a spherical reflection texture and aligns it to the view. The calculation can be offset by inputting a custom reflection vector.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **ReflectionVector (Vector 3)** | Takes in an existing reflection vector that needs to be aligned to the view.|
| **ReflectionTexture (TextureObject)** | Takes in an existing reflection texture, which needs to be spherical.|
|[REGION:tablesection]Outputs[/REGION] ||
| **Texture** | Outputs the resulting view-based reflection texture.|
| **UVs** | Outputs the UV coordinates of the reflection texture so they can be reapplied elsewhere.|

### WorldAlignedReflection

This function takes in an incoming sphere-based reflection texture and aligns it to the world coordinates. The calculation can be offset by inputting a custom reflection vector.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **ReflectionVector (Vector 3)** | Takes in an existing reflection vector that needs to be aligned to the view.|
| **ReflectionTexture (TextureObject)** | Takes in an existing reflection texture, which needs to be spherical.|
|[REGION:tablesection]Outputs[/REGION] ||
| **WorldReflection** | Outputs the world-based reflection texture.|
| **WorldReflectionShadowed** | Outputs a more highly contrasted version of the texture that can be applied in shadowed areas.|

### CustomReflectionVector

This function uses a normal map to generate a reflection vector independent of the default reflection vector and the normal's input on the base shader.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Normal (Vector3)** | Takes in a normal map to be used as the basis for the custom reflection vector.|
