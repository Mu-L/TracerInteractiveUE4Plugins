The Shading functions provide for specialized shading operations, such as fuzzy shading and adjusting the shape of a specular highlight.

## Shading Functions

The following is a list of all the functions underneath the Shading category.

### FuzzyShading

This function emulates a surface similar to velvet or moss, and is similar to a Fresnel calculation. Incidentally, it is also useful for shader effects such as a scanning electron microscope.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **Diffuse (Vector3)** | Takes in a texture to be used as the diffuse color.|
| **Normal (Vector3)** | Takes in a normal map used to perturb the surface of the fuzzy result.|
| **CoreDarkness (Scalar)** | Value used to darken the object wherever its normals become parallel to the camera, generally toward the center. The higher the number, the darker the core. Default is 0.8.|
| **Power (Scalar)** | Controls the rate of falloff from the core to the edge. Default is 6.0.|
| **EdgeBrightness (Scalar)** | Controls how bright the surface becomes as its normals become perpendicular to the camera, generally toward the edges.|

### FuzzyShadingGrass

This function is designed to provide the diffuse portion of grass shading. Similar to FuzzyShading, this function allows you to blend in a new color at the edges by first desaturating by a given percentage and then applying a custom color to the desaturated area.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **EdgeDesat (Scalar)** | 0-1 number controlling how much the edges of the object should be desaturated to make way for the edge color.|
| **EdgeColor (Vector3)** | This color will be applied to the edge area. Use *EdgeDesat* to desaturate that area if too much color mixing is taking place.|
| **Diffuse (Vector3)** | Takes in a texture to be used as the diffuse color.|
| **Normal (Vector3)** | Takes in a normal map used to perturb the surface of the fuzzy result.|
| **CoreDarkness (Scalar)** | Value used to darken the object wherever its normals become parallel to the camera, generally toward the center. The higher the number, the darker the core. Default is 0.8.|
| **Power (Scalar)** | Controls the rate of falloff from the core to the edge. Default is 6.0.|
| **EdgeBrightness (Scalar)** | Controls how bright the surface becomes as its normals become perpendicular to the camera, generally toward the edges.|

### TextureDefinedSpecularShape

This function allows you to specify a texture to be used as the shape of an object's specular highlight. It is currently in development and not yet complete.

| Item | Description |
| -------- | -------- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Inputs[/REGION] ||
| **HighlightShape (Texture Object)** | This takes in a texture to be used as the shape of the object's specular highlight.|
| **Normal (Vector3)** | Takes in a normal map used to perturb the specularity of the object.|
| **SpecularIntensity (Vector3)** | Takes in the texture used to define specular intensity across the object's surface.|
| **SpecularSharpness (Scalar)** | Controls the overall sharpness of the specular highlight as it blends between full bright to dark.|
