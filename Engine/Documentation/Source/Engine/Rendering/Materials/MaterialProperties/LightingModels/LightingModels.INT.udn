Shading Models control how your Material will reflect incoming light. Or, put another way, it controls how the input data that makes up the Material will be used to create the final look. 

![](LightingModelProperties.png)


There are six Shading Models in Unreal Engine 4: Default Lit, Unlit, Subsurface, Preintegrated Skin, Clear Coat, and Subsurface Profile. The first, Default Lit, is the one you will likely use for 
most of your surfaces, while the remaining five are special case shading models, intended to aid in producing more realistic results on certain types of objects and surfaces.

[REGION:note]
The following examples are all using Materials with their Blend Modes set to Opaque.
[/REGION]

## Default Lit

**Default Lit** is, as the name suggests, the default shading model and will likely be the one that you will use most often. 
This shading model makes use of direct and indirect lighting, as well as specularity for reflections.

When using the Default Lit Shading Model, you are given access to the following inputs:

* Base Color
* Metallic
* Specular
* Roughness
* Emissive Color
* Normal
* World Position Offset
* Ambient Occlusion


## Unlit

The **Unlit** Shading Model only outputs Emissive for color, making this perfect for special effects such as fire or illuminating objects. Note that in this example, the Material is _not_ casting light into the scene. Instead, its high Emissive value results in a glow effect, which is also picked up by the Dirt Mask applied to the camera. It _seems_ to illuminate, but no lighting or shadows will be cast by this object.

When using the Unlit Shading Model, you are given access to the following inputs:


* Emissive Color
* World Position Offset



## Subsurface
The **Subsurface** Shading Model simulates the effect of Subsurface Scattering. This is a real-world phenomenon in which light penetrates a surface and then diffuses throughout it. It can be most readily seen on such objects as ice, wax candles, and skin.
The Subsurface model (as well as the Preintegrated Skin model described below) relies on the _Subsurface Color_ input. You can think of this as the color of the matter just beneath the surface of the object, such that when light scatters through the surface, this color will be seen. For human skin, you can often get good results from using a dark red color. In the Ice Elemental below, a dark blue-green color (with a variety of calculations based on lighting) is used to give a sense of translucent depth to the surface.

For more information on the Subsurface Shading model, please see [the Subsurface Shading Model documentation](Engine/Rendering/Materials/LightingModels/SubSurface).

When using the Subsurface Shading Model, you are given access to the following inputs:

* Base Color
* Metallic
* Specular
* Roughness
* Emissive Color
* Opacity
* Normal
* World Position Offset
* Subsurface Color
* Ambient Occlusion

## Preintegrated Skin

The **Preintegrated Skin** Shading Model is very similar in nature to the Subsurface model, but geared toward low performance cost skin rendering on human characters. While not physically perfect, 
this Shading Model will often give nice results on your characters while being a bit cheaper to render than the Subsurface method. In the image below, the character's flesh has been set to use 
the Preintegrated Skin Shading Model.

When using the Preintegrated Skin Shading Model, you are given access to the following inputs:

* Base Color
* Metallic
* Specular
* Roughness
* Emissive Color
* Opacity
* Normal
* World Position Offset
* Subsurface Color
* Ambient Occlusion

## Clear Coat 
The **Clear Coat** Shading Model can be used to better simulate multilayer materials that have a thin translucent layer of film over the surface of a standard material.
In addition to this, the Clear Coat Shading Model can also be used with either a metal or nonmetal surfaces. In fact, it was specifically designed to model this second class of smooth colored films over a non-colored metal. 
Some examples include acrylic or lacquer clear coats, and colored films over metals such as soda cans and car paint.

### Dual-Normal Clear Coat
The Clear Coat Shading Model also has the option to add a 2nd Normal Map for the surface that is below the clear coat layer. This allows us to more accurately model complex materials such as carbon fiber which have a different geometric surface than the clear coat layer.

When using the Clear Coat Shading Model or the Clear Coat with Dual Normals Shading Model, you are given access to the following inputs:

* Base Color
* Metallic
* Specular
* Roughness
* Emissive Color
* Opacity
* Normal
* World Position Offset
* Ambient Occlusion
* Clear Coat 
* Clear Coat Roughness 


## Subsurface Profile

The [Subsurface Profile Shading Model](Engine/Rendering/Materials/LightingModels/SubSurfaceProfile) is very similar in nature to both the Subsurface model and the Preintegrated Skin Shading Model, 
but geared towards higher end skin rendering. If you are trying to simulate skin, epically human skin, this is the best Shading Model to use in order to do so.

* Emissive Color
* Opacity

## Two Sided Foliage

The **Two Sided Foliage** shading model was introduced to help give foliage a more natural and uniform look when being lit. 
When using the Default Lit shading model for foliage parts of the foliage can look almost black.
The Default Lit shading model also does not simulate any kind of light transmission which is key to having believable looking foliage.
The Two Sided Foliage shading model helps to eliminate these issues by using a variation of the Subsurface scattering lighting model that accounts for objects that are very thin helping to give the illusion that light is being transferred through the foliage.
This also helps to eliminate the dark parts of the foliage and give the foliage a more uniform look to it's lighting.
