In order for the **Pipeline State Object** (PSO) caching system to function correctly, it has to map the requested **Shaders** to the **Materials** that requested them.  This is accomplished by using the **ShaderPipelineCacheTools** commandlet to build a file that contains this mapping information. In the following How-To, we will take a look at how to use the ShaderPipelineCacheTools commandlet to build the needed files.

## Steps

1.  First, on the root of your C drive, make a new folder called **PSOCaching**.

2.  Next, open up your UE4 project folder to the following location and look for the **scl.csv** file.  
    `ProjectName\Saved\Cooked\PlatfourmYouCookedFor\ProjectName\Metadata\PipelineCaches`

3.  Copy the both **scl.csv** files that are in the Pipeline Caches folder into the **PSOCaching** folder that was created on the root of your C drive.

4.  Next, copy the **rec.upipelinecache** file that was generated when the project was run on a target device to the PSOCaching folder that was created on the C drive.

5.  To generate the needed files we will need to use UE4 commandlet function. To use the commandlet function, first open up the **Engine\\Binaries\\Win64** folder and look for the **UE4Editor-Cmd.exe** file.

6.  Right-click the **UE4Editor-Cmd.exe** file, and from the displayed list select the **Create Shortcut** option.

7.  Move the newly created shortcut to the **PSOCaching** folder that was created on the root of your C drive.

8.  Right-click UE4Editor-Cmd.exe shortcut, and from the displayed menu select the **Properties** option.

9.  In the Target input, add the following command line parameters after the end of **UE4Editor-Cmd.exe**.  
    
        ActionRPG -run=ShaderPipelineCacheTools expand C:/PSOCaching/*.rec.upipelinecache C:/PSOCaching/*.scl.csv ActionRPG_GLSL_ES3_1_ANDROID.stablepc.csv

10.  Click **OK** to close the shortcut properties dialogue box and then double-click UE4Editor-Cmd.exe - Shortcut to run the commandlet.

11.  Once the commandlet is finished running, a new file called **stablepc.csv** is created and placed in the PSOCaching folder that was created on the root of the C drive.

If you are not able to locate this file try checking in the Engine\\Binaries\\Win64 folder.

## End Result

With the scl.csv and the rec.upipelinecache files now combined together to produce the **stablepc.csv** file, next we need to place the stablepc.csv file in a specific location so that it will be used when your UE4 project is being built..
