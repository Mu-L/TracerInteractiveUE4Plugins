In order for your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project to utilize the shader data that is contained in the stablepc.csv file, you will first have to build your UE4 project using the stablepc.csv file. In the following How-To, we will take a look getting a UE4 project set up so that it will include the **Pipeline State Object** (PSO) cache data when the project is built.  

## Steps

1.  Locate the stablepc.csv file that was created in the [Building the PSO Cache How-To](Engine/Rendering/PSOCaching/BuildingPSOCache).
[REGION:note]
If you are not able to locate this file try checking in the Engine\\Binaries\\Win64 folder.

2.  Next, go to your projects **Build** \> **Platform Name** \> **PipelineCaches** folder and copy the stablepc.csv file to the Pipeline Caches folder.  
    
[REGION:note]
If you do not see the PipelineCaches folder, make a folder called **PipelineCaches** and place the stablepc.csv file into that folder.
[/REGION]
3.  When that has been completed, rebuild your UE4 project for the platforms that it supports.  
    

## End Results

When UE4 has finished building your project, you will now have a version of your UE4 project that can utilize the PSO caching data that was created.
