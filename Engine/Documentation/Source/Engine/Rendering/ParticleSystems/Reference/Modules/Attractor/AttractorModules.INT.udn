[TOC(start:2 end:3)]

These modules implement methods of causing particles to be attracted toward a specific position in space, which can be defined in the form of a point, line, or another particle's position. They can even be combined to create more complex effects.

This is the result of using a point attractor in combination with a line attractor with its strength animated over the life of the particle to create the swirling effect.

## Line Attractor

The **Line Attractor** allows for having particles be drawn to a line in 3D space.

| Property | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Attractor[/REGION]||
| **End Point 0** | Specifies one endpoint of the line to attract the particles toward.|
| **End Point 1** | Specifies the other endpoint of the line to attract the particles toward.|
| **Range** | A float distribution giving the radial range of the attraction around the line. Particle-life relative.|
| **Strength** | The strength of the attraction (negative values repel). Particle-life relative.|

The **Particle Attractor** allows for having particles be drawn to the particles emitted from another emitter in the system. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Attractor[/REGION]||
| **EmitterName** | The name of the attracting source emitter.|
| **Range** | A float distribution giving the radial range of the attraction around the source particle. Particle-life relative.|
| **Strength By Distance** | If _true_, the value in the strength curve is retrieved using the following value: (AttractorRange-DistanceToParticle)/AttractorRange. Otherwise, the strength is retrieved using the source particle RelativeTime.|
| **Strength** | The strength of the attraction (negative values repel). Particle-life relative if _Strength By Distance_ is _false_.|
| **Affect Base Velocity** | If _true_, the velocity adjustment will be applied to the base velocity.|
| **Renew Source** | If _true_, when the source particle expires, a new one will be selected. Otherwise, the particle will no longer be attracted to another.|
| **Inherit Source Vel** | If _true_, the particle will inherit the velocity of the source if it expires.|
|[REGION:tablesection]Location[/REGION]||
| **SelectionMethod** | The method to use when selecting an attractor target particle from the emitter. Can be one of the following:[INCLUDE:#SelectionMethod]|

The **Point Attractor** allows for defining a point to which particles are attracted and its radius of effect. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Attractor[/REGION]||
| **Position** | A vector distribution indicating the position of the point with respect to the particle emitter. The value is retrieved using EmitterTime. |
| **Range** | A float distribution that gives the radius of the points effect. The value is retrieved using EmitterTime.|
| **Strength** | The strength of the point attractor. The value is retrieved using EmitterTime. |
| **Strength By Distance** | If _true_, the strength is distributed evenly along the radius. |
| **Affect Base Velocity** | If _true_, the base velocity of the particle will be adjusted to retain the pull of the attractor.|
| **Override Velocity** | Unused. |
| **Use World Space Position** | If _true_, the position is assumed to be in world-space coordinates.|

The **Point Gravity** module attracts particles towards a singular point in 3D space, using a given strength value. It is similar to the Newton field in Maya's particle system. It can be used to pull particles toward a source or to create orbital effects around a point.

[REGION:warning]
	Point Gravity is the only Attractor module usable by GPU Sprites.

| Property | Description |
| ----- | ----- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Point Gravity Source[/REGION]||
| **Position** | Provides the point in 3D space where the gravity will originate. |
| **Radius** | The radial area of effect of the gravitational pull. |
| **Strength** | This float distribution dictates how much affect the gravity point will have on the particles. |
