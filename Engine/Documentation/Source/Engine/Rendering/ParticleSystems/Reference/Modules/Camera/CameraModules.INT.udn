These modules modify the emitter behavior with respect to the camera.


## Camera Offset

![CameraOffset.png](CameraOffset.png)

In this example, the blue particles are the same size as the red ones, and are being emitted from the same location. However, a Camera Offset node is offsetting the blue particles, pulling them closer to the camera.

The **Camera Offset** module allows the positions of sprite particles to be offset relative to the camera. In essence, it pulls particles closer toward the camera or pushes them away. It provides the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Camera[/REGION]||
|**Camera Offset** | The camera-relative offset to apply to the sprite particle location.|
|**Spawn Time Only** | If _true_, the offset from this module will only be processed when the particle is originally spawned.|
|**Update Method** | Specifies the method to use when updating the offset from this module. The following options are available:[INCLUDE:#UpdateMethod]|
