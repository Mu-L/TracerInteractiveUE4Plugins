Color modules impact the color of the emitted particles.

[REGION:note]
	Color modules require the material used by the emitter to be using a Particle Color material expression to pass the color from the module to the material.
[/REGION]

[REGION:note]
	Color is calculated on a full floating point range. Values beyond 1 will often result in a glow effect.

The **Initial Color** module sets the color of a particle at spawn time. The particle will retain this color over its lifetime unless another color module overrides it. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| [REGION:tablesection]Color[/REGION]||
| **Start Color** | A vector distribution indicating the color of the particle. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
| **Start Alpha** | A float distribution indicating the alpha component of the particle. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
| **Clamp Alpha** | If _true_, the alpha value will be clamped to the [0.0 .. 1.0f] range.|


In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distributions using the emitter time, setting the Particle.Color and Particle.BaseColor values to it directly.


## Init Color (Seed)

The **Init Color (Seed)** module is identical to the [Initial Color](#InitialColor) module in that it sets the initial color of a particle at spawn time; however, this module allows you to specify seed information to be used when choosing distribution values in order to provide a more consistent effect from the module each time the emitter is used. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]RandomSeed[/REGION]||
|**Random Seed Info** | The random seed(s) to use for selecting "random" values for this module's properties.[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems/Reference#RandomSeedInfo]|
|[REGION:tablesection]Color[/REGION]||
|**Start Color** | A vector distribution indicating the color of the particle. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
|**Start Alpha** | A float distribution indicating the alpha component of the particle. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|
|**Clamp Alpha** | If _true_, the alpha value will be clamped to the [0.0 .. 1.0f] range.|





In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distributions using the emitter time, setting the Particle.Color and Particle.BaseColor values to it directly.

The **Color Over Life** module is used to set the color of a particle over its lifetime. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Color[/REGION]||
|**Color Over Life** | A vector distribution indicating the color to apply to a particle. The value is retrieved using the RelativeTime of the particle during its update.|
|**Alpha Over Life** | A float distribution indicating the alpha component to apply to a particle. The value is retrieved using the RelativeTime of the particle during its update.|
|**Clamp Alpha** | If _true_, the alpha value will be clamped to the [0.0 .. 1.0f] range.|


In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distributions using the particle time, and sets the Particle Color and BaseColor values to it. 

[REGION:note]
	The Color is **set** by this module. This means that any color modules that came before it will have their value stepped on!
[/REGION]

In Update, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distributions using the particle time, and sets the Particle.Color value to it.


## Scale Color/Life

The **Scale Color/Life** module is used to scale the color of a particle over its lifetime. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Color[/REGION]||
|**Color Scale Over Life** | A vector distribution indicating the color to apply to a particle. The value is retrieved using the RelativeTime of the particle during its update.|
|**Alpha Scale Over Life** | A float distribution indicating the alpha component to apply to a particle. The value is retrieved using the RelativeTime of the particle during its update.|
|**Emitter Time** | A Boolean indicating if the effect should be based on the emitter time or the particle time.|


In Spawn and Update, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distributions using the selected time, and uses these values to scale the particle color.
