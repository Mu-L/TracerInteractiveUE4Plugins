The **Lifetime** module is used to set the initial lifetime of a particle at spawn time. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Lifetime[/REGION]||
|**Lifetime** | A float distribution indicating the lifetime of the particle, in seconds. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|


In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distribution using the current emitter time. This is then added to the Particle.OneOverMaxLifetime field, to allow for multiple lifetime modules to be applied.


## Lifetime (Seeded)

The **Lifetime (Seeded)** module is identical to the [Lifetime](#Lifetime) module in that it sets the lifetime of a particle at spawn time; however, this module allows you to specify seed information to be used when choosing distribution values in order to provide a more consistent effect from the module each time the emitter is used. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]RandomSeed[/REGION]||
|**Random Seed Info** | The random seed(s) to use for selecting "random" values for this module's properties. It includes the following values:[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems/Reference#RandomSeedInfo]|
|[REGION:tablesection]Lifetime[/REGION]||
|**Lifetime** | A float distribution indicating the lifetime of the particle, in seconds. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle.|


In Spawn, the module retrieves the appropriate values from the distribution using the current emitter time. This is then added to the Particle.OneOverMaxLifetime field, to allow for multiple lifetime modules to be applied.
