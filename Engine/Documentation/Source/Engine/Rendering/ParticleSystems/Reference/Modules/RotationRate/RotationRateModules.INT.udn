These modules apply a constant rate of rotation - or "spin" - to the particles.

## Init Mesh RotRate


The **Initial RotRate** module is used to set the rotation rate of a mesh particle when it is emitted. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Rotation[/REGION]||
|**Start Rotation Rate** | A float distribution indicating the rotation rate the particle should have, in rotations per second. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle, and is added to the Particle RotationRate and Base RotationRate values.|

## Init Mesh RotRate (Seed)

The **Initial RotRate (Seeded)** module is identical to the [Init Mesh RotRate](#InitMeshRotRate) module in that it sets the rotation rate of a mesh particle when it is emitted; however, this module allows you to specify seed information to be used when choosing distribution values in order to provide a more consistent effect from the module each time the emitter is used. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]RandomSeed[/REGION]||
|**Random Seed Info** | The random seed(s) to use for selecting "random" values for this module's properties.[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems/Reference#RandomSeedInfo]|
|[REGION:tablesection]Rotation[/REGION]||
|**Start Rotation Rate** | A float distribution indicating the rotation rate the particle should have, in rotations per second. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime at the spawn of the particle, and is added to the Particle RotationRate and Base RotationRate values.|


## Mesh RotRate*Life


The **Mesh RotRate Life** module is used to scale the rotation rate of a mesh particle over its lifetime. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Rotation[/REGION]||
|**Life Multiplier** | A float distribution indicating the scale factor that should be applied to the rotation rate of the particle. Value is retrieved based on the RelativeTime at the spawn and update of the particle, and the Particle.RotationRate is multiplied by it.|



## Mesh Rot Rate Over Life

The **Mesh Rot Rate Over Life** module is used to set the rotation rate of a mesh-based particle over its lifetime. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Rotation[/REGION]||
|**Rot Rate** | A vector distribution indicating the rotation rate the particle should have, in rotations per second. The value is retrieved using the particle-relative time.|
|**Scale Rot Rate** | If _true_, the current rotation rate of the particle is scaled by the value of the _Rot Rate_ distribution.|
