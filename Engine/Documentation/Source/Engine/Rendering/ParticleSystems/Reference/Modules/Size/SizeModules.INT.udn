These modules affect the sizes of particles across various points of their lifespans.

The **Initial Size** module is used to set the initial size of a particle at spawn time. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Size[/REGION]||
|**Start Size** | A vector distribution indicating the initial size that should be used for a particle. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime during the spawn of the particle and added to the Size and BaseSize of the spawning particle.|



## Initial Size (Seeded)

The **Initial Size (Seeded)** module is identical to the [Initial Size](#InitialSize) module in that it sets the size of a particle when it is emitted; however, this module allows you to specify seed information to be used when choosing distribution values in order to provide a more consistent effect from the module each time the emitter is used. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]RandomSeed[/REGION]||
|**Random Seed Info** | The random seed(s) to use for selecting "random" values for this module's properties.[INCLUDE:Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems/Reference#RandomSeedInfo]|
|[REGION:tablesection]Size[/REGION]||
|**Start Size** | A vector distribution indicating the initial size that should be used for a particle. Value is retrieved based on the EmitterTime during the spawn of the particle and added to the Size and BaseSize of the spawning particle.|



## Size By Life

The Size By Life module scales the size of the particle by a given value over its lifetime. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Size[/REGION]||
|**LifeMultiplier** | A vector distribution indicating the scale factor for the size that should be used for a particle. Value is retrieved based on the RelativeTime of the particle during its update.|
|**Multiply X, Multiply Y, Multiply Z** | If _true_, the corresponding scale factor will be applied to the particle size. If _false_, the corresponding component is left unaltered.|


During both Spawn and Update, the Particle.Size value is multiplied with the retrieved scale value.


## Size Scale

The Size Scale module sets the Size of the particle to the BaseSize times the given scale factor. NOTE that this module overrides any size adjustments made prior to this module in that frame. It contains the following member(s): 

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]ParticleModuleSizeScale[/REGION]||
|**Size Scale** | A vector distribution indicating how the BaseSize should be scaled before being used as the size of the particle. The value is retrieved using the RelativeTime of the particle during its update.|
|**Enable X, Enable Y, Enable Z** | Ignored.|


## Size By Speed

Rather than recede into the distance, these particles are actually shrinking as they slow down.

Scales the size of a particle by a portion of its speed. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]Size[/REGION]||
|**Speed Scale** | This is used to set the scale amount in the X and Y axes for the sprite. |
|**Max Scale** | Provides a maximum scale size, functioning like a clamp. |


During both Spawn and Update, the Particle.Size value is multiplied by the retrieved scale value times the velocity of the particle at that time.
