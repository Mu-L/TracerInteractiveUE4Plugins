Version: 4.9

[TOC(start:2 end:3)]

SubUV modules allow particles to utilize subUV textures, in which a grid of individual "frames" is laid out.

[REGION:note]
SubUV modules should only be applied to an emitter when the InterpolationMethod is set to something other than PSUVIM_None.

## SubImage Index

The **SubImage Index** module selects the sub-image to use based on a float distribution. Currently, sub-images are ordered from left-to-right, top-to-bottom. It contains the following member(s):

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]SubUV[/REGION]||
|**Sub Image Index** | A float distribution indicating the index of the sub-image should be utilized for the particle. The value is retrieved using the RelativeTime of the particle during its update. [REGION:note]Slightly higher values should be used due to the actual value being a float. For example, if the second image is desired - image 1 - then the value should be set to 1.01.[/REGION]|
|[REGION:tablesection]Realtime[/REGION]||
|**Use Real Time**|If _true_, the movie will play back in real time regardless of the slo-mo settings of the game.|



## SubUV Movie

The **SubUV Movie** module cycles through the sub-images of the texture in sequential order at a specified frame rate, similar to how a flipbook texture behaves. It contains the following properties:

| Property | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
|[REGION:tablesection]FlipBook[/REGION]||
|**Use Emitter Time** |If _true_, the emitter time is used to retrieve the value of the _FrameRate_ distribution. Otherwise, the relative particle time is used.|
|**Frame Rate** | A float distribution specifying the frame rate at which the sub-images should be 'flipped' through.|
|**Starting Frame** | The starting image index for the SubUV (1 = the first frame). Assumes order of Left->Right, Top->Bottom. If greater than the last frame, it will clamp to the last one. If 0, then randomly selects a starting frame.|
|[REGION:tablesection]Realtime[/REGION]||
|**Use Real Time**|If _true_, the movie will play back in real time regardless of the slo-mo settings of the game.|
