## Global Vector Fields

![GlobalVF.png](GlobalVF.png)(w:720)

In this image, the small highlighted streaks throughout the scene are visualizations of a Global Vector Field Volume placed in the level.

The **Global Vector Fields** module allows for particle systems to use global vector fields. These are vector fields that are placed via volumes within a level, rather than being an inherent part of a particle system.

In order to be fully utilized, a Vector Field Volume Actor must exist in the level with a Vector Field associated with it.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vector Field[/REGION]||
| ---- | ----- |
| **Global Vector Field Scale** | This float value scales the amount of effect the global vector field will have on particle motion. Values lower than 1 will dampen the effect, while values greater than one will overdrive it. | 


## Local Vector Field

![LocalVF.png](LocalVF.png)

The **Local Vector Field** module allows for a vector field to be associated directly with an emitter inside a particle system. This is useful when the vector field and the particle system are considered a single unit.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vector Field[/REGION]||
| ---- | ----- |
| **Vector Field** | Property contains the assigned Vector Field from the **Content Browser**. Simply select the desired vector field and then click the arrow button to assign it. |
| **Relative Translation** | This allows the vector fields position to be offset within the emitter. [INCLUDE:#LocalTranslateNote]|
| **Relative Rotation** | This allows for a rotational offset for the local vector field. |
| **Relative Scale 3D** | This allows the scale of the Local Vector Field to be edited, which is useful depending on the scale the vector field was created. |
| **Intensity** | This affects the overall intensity of the local vector field. Think of it as a multiplier for the vector field's force. A value of 0 effectively deactivates the vector field. Values greater than 1 will overdrive the effect. |
| **Tightness** | This value controls how the vector field will control particle movement. A value of 0 means that the vector field is working as a force, additively influencing the velocity of the particles. A value of 1 means that particle velocity is completely replaced by the velocity defined in the vector field grid. Values between 0 and 1 blend the overall result between these two extremes. |

## VF Init Rotation

![VFInitRot.png](VFInitRot.png)

The **Vector Field Initial Rotation** module will allow for an initial amount of rotation to be applied to a vector field. This is useful when the vector field's overall direction needs tweaking, or to get a more randomized feel for the particle system's movement. This module automatically uses a max/min range for randomization of the vector field's rotation.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vector Field[/REGION]||
| ---- | ----- |
| **Min Initial Rotation** | The minimum initial rotation on the X, Y, and Z axes. This value is calculated as a [0..1] value. 0.25 = 90 degrees, 0.5 = 180 degrees, and so on. |
| **Max Initial Rotation** | The maximum initial rotation on the X, Y, and Z axes. This value is calculated as a [0..1] value. 0.25 = 90 degrees, 0.5 = 180 degrees, and so on. |

If you need a local vector field to have a constant rate of spin, then the **VF Rotation Rate** module is exactly what you need. Applying it allows for the specified vector field to have distributed rotation rate. This can lead to some highly interesting effects.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vector Field[/REGION]||
| ---- | ----- |
| **Rotation Rate** | This sets the rotation rate on the X, Y, and Z axes. The value is calculated in full rotations per second. So a value of 0.1 will require 10 seconds to make one full rotation. |


## Vector Field Scale

The **Vector Field Scale** module allows for scaling of a vector field's influence. This is calculated only at the moment of particle birth.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vector Field[/REGION]||
| ---- | ----- |
| **Vector Field Scale** | This float distribution works like a multiplier for the vector field's influence. |



## VF Scale/Life

The **Vector Field Scale Over Life** module allows for the scaling of a local vector field to take place over the life of an emitter. This is calculated throughout a particle's lifespan.

[REGION:note]
	When using this module, it can be useful to visualize vector fields in the **Preview** Panel. This is done by clicking View > Vector Fields within the **Preview** Panel.

| **Properties** | **Description** |
|[REGION:tablesection]Vector Field[/REGION]||
| ---- | ----- |
| **Vector Field Scale Over Life** | This float distribution works like a multiplier for the vector field's influence.  By applying a curve, the scaling can be controlled over the life of the particle. |

	Although you can change the translation of a local vector field numerically, it is far more intuitive to do it via the move widget in the **Preview** Pane. This widget is available whenever the Local Vector Field module is selected in the Emitter List.
