[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **Mesh** type data module indicates that the emitter should use StaticMesh instances rather than sprite particles. This is great for effects such as shrapnel or debris.
[/EXCERPT:Intro]

The **Mesh** type data module has the following properties:

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Mesh[/REGION]||
|**Mesh**| The StaticMesh that is rendered at the position of the emitter's particles.|
|**Mesh Alignment**| The alignment to use when rendering the mesh. The Required Module's _Screen Alignment_ property MUST be set to _PSA_TypeSpecific_ for this property to have any effect. The following options are provided: [INCLUDE:#MeshAlignmentOption]|
|**Override Material**| If _true_, the meshes will be rendered using the material from the emitter (assigned in the RequiredModule) rather than those applied to the Static Mesh model. Use this over the MeshMaterial module unless you have multiple UV channels on your mesh you need to assign material to, or you need to parameterize the material assignment for code.
|[REGION:tablesection]Orientation[/REGION]||
|**Pitch**| The 'pre' rotation pitch (in degrees) to apply to the Static Mesh used.|
|**Roll**| The 'pre' rotation roll (in degrees) to apply to the Static Mesh used.|
|**Yaw**| The 'pre' rotation yaw (in degrees) to apply to the Static Mesh used.|
|**Axis Lock Option**| The axis to lock the mesh on. This overrides TypeSpecific mesh alignment as well as the LockAxis module. The following options are provided: [INCLUDE:#AxisLockOption]|
|[REGION:tablesection]CameraFacing[/REGION]||
|**Camera Facing**| If _true_, then the X-axis of the mesh will always point towards the camera. When set, _Axis Lock Option_ as well as all other locked axis/screen alignment settings are ignored.|
|**Camera Facing Option**| Determines how the mesh is oriented when the _Camera Facing_ option is enabled. The following options are provided: [INCLUDE:#CameraFacingOption]|
|**Apply Particle Rotation As Spin**| If _true_, the 'sprite' particle rotation is applied to the mesh about the orientation axis (the direction mesh is pointing). Otherwise, the 'sprite' particle rotation is applied to the mesh about the camera facing axis.|
|**Face Camera Direction Rather Than Position**| If _true_, all camera facing options will point the mesh against the camera's view direction rather than pointing at the camera's location.|

|**Option**|**Description**|
| --- | --- |
|_XAxisFacing_NoUp_|The mesh's local X-axis faces the camera, while no attempt is made to face the other axes up or down.|

|_XAxisFacing_NegativeYUp_|The mesh's local X-axis faces the camera, while the mesh's local Y-axis will attempt to face down (towards the world negative Z-axis).|
|_LockedAxis_ZAxisFacing_|The mesh's local X-axis is locked on the _Axis Lock Option_ axis, while the mesh's local Z-axis is rotated to face towards camera.|
|_LockedAxis_NegativeZAxisFacing_|The mesh's local X-axis is locked on the _Axis Lock Option_ axis, while the mesh's local Z-axis is rotated to face away from camera.|
|_LockedAxis_YAxisFacing_|The mesh's local X-axis is locked on the _Axis Lock Option_ axis, while the mesh's local Y-axis is rotated to face towards camera.|

[EXCERPT:CameraFacingCaveats]
[REGION:note]All axis-locked camera facing options assume the AxisLockOption is set. EPAL_NONE will be treated as EPAL_X.[/REGION]

[REGION:note]All velocity-aligned options do NOT require the ScreenAlignment be set to PSA_Velocity. Doing so will result in additional work being performed (it will orient the mesh twice).[/REGION]

|**Option**|**Description**|
| --- | --- |
|_PSMA_MeshFaceCameraWithRoll_|Face the camera allowing for rotation around the mesh-to-camera vector (amount provided by the standard particle sprite rotation).|
|_PSMA_MeshFaceCameraWithSpin_|Face the camera allowing for the mesh to rotate about the tangential axis.|
|_PSMA_MeshFaceCameraWithLockedAxis_|Face the camera while maintaining the up vector as the locked direction.|
