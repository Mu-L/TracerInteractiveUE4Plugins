In this section, we will take a look at how to bring all parts of this how to together so that we can create and save Texture assets based on the Material that was created.

## Texture Creation
Now that all of the required parts have been created and set up, we will take a look at how to create and save the Textures that are created.

1. Locate the `BP_Texture_Creator` Blueprint in the Content Browser, dragging it into the level.

1. Locate the `RT_Material_00` Material in the Content Browser and double-click on it to open it up. When opened, select the **Noise** Material Expression node.

1. With the **Noise** Material Expression selected,  go to the **Details** panel and input the following values into their respective parameters. When completed, press the **Apply** button to compile the Material.

	* **Scale:** 2.0 
	* **Levels:** 8.0
	* **Output Min:** -0.01
	* **Level Scale:** 3.0

1. Select the `BP_Texture_Creator` Blueprint that was placed in the level and move it slightly in any direction to update the `RT_00` render target that is in the Content Browser. When you do this, you should see the `RT_00` render target update and display exactly what was in the `RT_Material_00`.

	[region:note]
	Anytime you want to see or update the changes that were made in the Material, you will need to [slightly] move the Blueprint. 
	[/region]

1. Inside of the Content Browser, right-click on the `RT_00` render target and in the **Render Targets Actions** section of the menu, select the **Create Static Texture** option to create a new Texture asset that will display the output of `RT_Material_00`.

## End Result

When completed, you should have a new 2D Texture that will display the contents of `RT_Material_00` that is now ready to be used in any other Material of your liking.

Remember that in order to see your changes you will need to make sure that you compile your Material and [slightly] move your Blueprint so that your changes will be propagated to your render target.
