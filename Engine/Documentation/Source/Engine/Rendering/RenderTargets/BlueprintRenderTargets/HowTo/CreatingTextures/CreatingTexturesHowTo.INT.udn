When creating Textures for your Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project, you will generally need to use an external 2D painting program like Adobe Photoshop or GIMP. While authoring content in this manner can give you amazing results, there are some instances where having the ability to create content like this inside of UE4 would be helpful. In the following How - To, we will take a look at how you can use Blueprints and render targets to create Textures 
for your UE4 projects by first creating a new empty level in a UE4 project and then creating and setting up the render targets for use.
