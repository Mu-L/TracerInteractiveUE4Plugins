In this section, we will go over how to set your project up so that you can create a fluid surface Blueprint.


## Project Setup
The project setup for the Fluid surface is the same as for the Height Field Painter. If you have not done so, read the **Project Setup** section of the [](Engine\Rendering\RenderTargets\BlueprintRenderTargets\HowTo\HeightFieldPainter) How To guide. 
When completed you should now have a new Game Mode and HUD. When you run the project, you should see something similar to the image below.

 In the next section we will take a look at creating all of the required assets to create a Fluid Surface Blueprint.
