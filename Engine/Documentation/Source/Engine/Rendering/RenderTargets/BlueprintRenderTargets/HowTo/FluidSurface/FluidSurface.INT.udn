Using Blueprints and Render Targets, you can create a fluid surface that simulates what happens to water when it is hit by a projectile or player. 
In the following guide we will learn how you can use Blueprints & Render Targets to create a fluid surface actor by creating a new set of render targets and Materials that are specifically setup to work with render targets. We will then create and setup a new Blueprint that will contain and power the fluid surface interaction when the fluid surface is touched or shot at.
