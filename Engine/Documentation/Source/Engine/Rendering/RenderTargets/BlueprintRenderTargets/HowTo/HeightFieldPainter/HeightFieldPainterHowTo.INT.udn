Having the ability to raise and lower various surfaces enables interesting and unique gameplay elements. In the following How To, we will go over how you can use Blueprints & Render Targets to create a Height Field Painter that raises the surface of an object when the player shoots at it. To accomplish this we will first create and setup a new Game Mode and HUD Blueprint that will allow the user to interact with the Height Field Painter. We will then create and setup the needed render targets and Materials. Finally we will create a Blueprint that will tie all of the individual pieces together, resulting in a Blueprint that can raise the surface of the object that it is applied to inside of Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).
