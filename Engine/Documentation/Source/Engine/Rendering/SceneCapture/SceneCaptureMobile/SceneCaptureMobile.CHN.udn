[region:note]
When rendering Scene Captures, the Scene Capture Source settings that output Inverse Opacity and Depth values are  supported on Mobile devices. 
[/region]

* The **SceneColor (HDR) in RGB, Inv Opacity in A** option can be used to render objects with translucency into a Texture which can then be alpha-blended over a scene or widget Blueprint. 

* Similarly, the depth value can be used as a mask when using the resulting Texture.

* Generating the Ppacity data has some cost, so use **SceneColor (HDR) in RGB, 0 in A** for improved performance if you do not need Opacity.

* Scene captures now work correctly on devices that do not support floating point targets, such as Galaxy S6 prior to Android 6.
