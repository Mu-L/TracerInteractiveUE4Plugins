When using Scene Capture Actors in a project that will be deployed to moblie devices, there are some guidelines you may want to follow to ensure that they are as performant as possible when running on mobile devices.

[region:note]
When rendering Scene Captures, the Scene Capture Source settings that output **Inverse Opacity** and **Depth Values** are supported on Mobile devices. 
[/region]

* The **SceneColor (HDR) in RGB, Inv Opacity in A** option can be used to render objects with translucency into a Texture which can then be alpha-blended over a scene or Widget Blueprint. 

* Similarly, the Depth Value can be used as a mask when using the resulting Texture.

* Generating the Opacity data has some cost, so use **SceneColor (HDR) in RGB, 0 in A** for improved performance if you do not need Opacity.

**Supported Capture Sources**

The following is a list of capture sources that are supported on mobile:

* **SceneColor** (HDR) in **RGB**, **Inv Opacity** in **A**
* **SceneColor** (HDR) in **RGB**, **0** in **A**
* **SceneColor** (HDR) in **RGB**, **SceneDepth** in **A**
* **Final Color** (LDR) in **RGB**
* **Scene Depth** in **R**
