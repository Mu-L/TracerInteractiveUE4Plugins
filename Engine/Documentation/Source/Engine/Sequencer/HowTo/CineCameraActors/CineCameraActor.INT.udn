The **Cine Camera Actor** is a specialized [**Camera Actor**](Engine/Actors/CameraActors/) with additional camera settings that are found in most real-world cameras today. 
The ability to adjust **Filmback**, **Lens**, or **Focus** settings gives content creators more tools than the standard Camera Actor in producing more cinematic looking shots. 
There is also the ability to track a specified Actor in a scene automatically as well as auto-focus on that Actor which makes shooting shots even easier than before. 

In this how-to we enable look at tracking of an Actor, adjust filmback, lens, and focus settings to produce a cinematic shot. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	From the Main Tool bar, click **Cinematics** then select **Add Level Sequence**.

1.	From the **Modes** panel under **Cinematic**, drag a **Cine Camera Actor** into the level and position as shown below.

	[REGION:note]
	See [**Manipulating Actors**](GettingStarted/HowTo/ManipulatingActors) for controls on how to move, rotate, and scale Actors in a level. 
	[/REGION]

1.	In Sequencer, click the **Add** button and add the Cine Camera Actor to the Level Sequence.

1.	With the **CineCameraActor** selected, press **S** to add a keyframe for the current **Transform**. This lets Sequencer know the starting position of the camera and where to start moving from.

1.	In Sequencer, move the Timeline to the end of the Level Sequence (frame **150**). 

1.	In the level, move the camera up and forward as shown below then press **S** to add a keyframe at the desired position. This will give us some camera movement during our scene.

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **CineCameraActor**, set the **Look at Tracking Settings** below. We used the following settings : 

	* **Enable Look at Tracking** - check this option as it will allow the camera to track an Actor. 
	* **Draw Debug Look at Tracking Position** - check this option as it will allow us to see where the camera is looking at. 
	* **Actor to Track** - set this to **ThirdPersonCharacter** as we want to track this character for our shot. 
	* **Relative Offset** - set the **Z** to **60** to raise the tracking position slightly from its default tracking position.

	You should see a yellow box near the head of the character indicating where the tracking position is.

1.	Also in the **Details** panel for the **CineCameraActor**, set the **Filmback Settings** to use **Super 16mm**. The **Filmback Settings** provide different formats that you can experiment with to get different aspect ratios.

	![](CineCamera7.png) 

1.	Expand the **Lens Settings** section and set the **Min Focal Length** to **50.0mm** and **Max Focal Length** to **1000.0mm**. The Min/Max Focal Length settings will affect the range in which we can apply Focal Length in mm which we will set in a moment. You can select different Lens Settings from the drop-down menu which are some of the standard settings used with real-world cameras today or you can use your own custom settings.

1.	Expand the **Focus Settings** section and change the **Focus Method** to **Tracking**. 

1.	Next to **Actor to Track**, click the **Eye Dropper** icon. 

	![](CineCamera9.png)

1.	Move the **Eye Dropper** over the character in the level, then **left-click** to select it. This will ensure that the focus will always track the Actor we've selected.

	![](CineCamera10.png) 

1.	Move the Timeline back to frame 0, then for **Current Focal Length** add another keyframe. Our Focal Length of **50.0mm** will be used to start the scene, and we will change this value over time.

	![](CineCamera11.png) 

1.	Move the Timeline to the end of the Sequence (frame **150**) and set the **Current Focal Length** to **75.0** and keyframe it. This will cause the camera to zoom in slightly during the course of the shot.

	![](CineCamera12.png)

1.	In the level select the **ThirdPersonCharacter** then hold **Alt** and drag out a copy and position slightly behind the first. Our camera will pan around and up to reveal the character standing behind our tracked character.

	![](CineCamera13.png) 

1.	In Sequencer, click the **Add** button and add a **Camera Cut Track**. 

	![](CineCamera14.png)

1.	Move the Timeline back to **0**, then click the **+ Camera** button and select the **CineCameraActor**. This will ensure that this sequence will use the camera we have added to shoot the scene from. 

	![](CineCamera15.png)

1.	Click the **Preview Play** button. 

	
## End Result

You should have something similar to below where the camera pans up and around to shoot our characters. Below, we turned off the debug tracking, enabled **Game View** (**G** key in the viewport) and locked the camera to our **Camera Cuts Track**.
