When creating your cinematic sequences, you may want to blend existing gameplay animation with animation contained inside your Level Sequence. 
For example, a playable character walks up to a door during gameplay and you want Sequencer to animate the character and open the door. 
Or a player is controlling their character in a third person shooter and comes around a blind corner and you want to blend in a cinematic death sequence. 
By using a combination of Sequencer, Blueprint, and an Animation Blueprint you can blend whatever gameplay pose your character is in with a **Slot** animation defined by Sequencer. 

In this example, we take whatever gameplay pose the character is in when entering a trigger volume and blend it with a death animation inside Sequencer.
