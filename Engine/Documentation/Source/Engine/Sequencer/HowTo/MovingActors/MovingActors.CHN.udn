When creating your cinematic, you may want to move objects around in your scene (for example, moving a camera which you are shooting from, opening a door, moving a car down the street). 
Using the **Transform** track of an Actor added to Sequencer, you can keyframe a starting position, scrub the timeline forward then move the Actor to a new position and keyframe it to have that Actor move between keyframes over time. 
Sequencer enables you to also isolate the axis to move on which is useful in situations where you want the Actor to move in a direction, regardless of where the Actor is in the scene. 

In this example, we move a box around in the scene using the **Transform** track.

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to guide, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	Inside your project, from the **Modes** panel under **Basic**, drag the **Cube** asset into the level.

1.	From the main toolbar, click the **Cinematics** button then select **Add Level Sequence**.

1.	In the **Save Asset As** window, choose a save name and location then click the **Save** button.

1.	Inside the level select the cube, then inside **Sequencer**, click the **Track** button and under **Actor To Sequencer** select **Add Cube**. 

	![](MovingActors_03.png)

	This will add the cube to and enable us to control through the Sequencer Editor. 

1.	On the **Transform** track for the cube, click the **+** symbol to add a key at frame **0**. 

	![](MovingActors_04.png)

	This will add a keyframe for the current transform of the cube to Sequencer. 

1.	Scrub the timeline marker forward to frame **100**, then move the cube in the level along the **Y** axis forward and add a key for it by clicking the **+** symbol.

	After adding the keyframe at frame 100, you will see a dotted line inside the viewport indicating the movement path of the cube.

	If you click the preview play button, you will see the cube move along your specified path.

	In the video above, the cube moves along our specified path but what if we wanted to have the cube follow the same path but in a different location in the level? 
	You can see in the video that if we move the cube, whenever we click play the cube jumps back to the transform information provided in the first keyframe. 
	Sequencer gives you the option to determine which individual axis track is the active track, in our case we only care about the Y axis. 

1.	Click the expand icon next to **Transform** to expand all the transform tracks, then expand **Location** as well. 

	![](MovingActors_07.png)

	Each of the pink circles indicates keyframes and we are currently set to use Location, Rotation and Scale from our Transform as well as the X, Y and Z axis. 
	If we wanted our cube to move along the **Y** axis regardless of where it is in the level, we would set only the **Y** axis to be the **Active Channel**. 

1.	Right-click on the **Transform** track inside the keyframe window and uncheck all **Active Channels** except the **Y** under **Translation**. 

	![](MovingActors_08.png)

	This will instruct the cube to move along the **Y** axis relative to its current position. 

1.	Move the cube to a new location in the level, then click the **Preview Play** button in the viewport or inside Sequencer.

## End Result

When we play the sequence, the cube will move along the **Y** axis based on where the cube is in the level.

Above, we have our movement defined and we move our cube to a new location. The cube still moves along our predefined movement (along the Y axis) and we can re-key where we want it to start along the Y by clicking the **+** on the **Y Axis** track. 
This type of transform keying is useful when you have an Actor that you want to move along a predefined path but relative to its current position. For example, you could have an elevator that moves up along the Z axis placed in different locations in the level.
