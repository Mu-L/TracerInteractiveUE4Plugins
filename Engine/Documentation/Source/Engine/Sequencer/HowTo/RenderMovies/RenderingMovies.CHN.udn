Once you have created your cinematic sequence (or even during your production process as part of daily reviews), you may want to render out your cinematic as a movie file that you can share with others. 
The **Render Movie** option in Sequencer enables you to share your experience with others as an .AVI file that will play with most media players. 
In addition to rendering as a movie file, you can render your cinematic as an Image Sequence or render out [Custom Render Passes](Engine/Sequencer/Workflow/CustomRenderPass) that you can use in an external application to finalize your scene. 

In this example, we create a sample cinematic and render it out as a movie while outlining some of the options that are available as part of the rendering process:

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to guide, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** with **Starter Content** enabled.

1.	Inside your project, from the Main Toolbar click the **Cinematics** button then select **Add Level Seequence**.

1.	In the Viewport, position the camera anywhere in the Level facing the Character, then press the **S** key to add a keyframe. 

	![](RenderMovie_04.png)

	We will shoot a sample scene where the camera pushes in our the Character in the level for a close-up shot. 

1.	In the **Sequencer Editor** move to frame **150**, then move the Camera in the Level to a new location and press the **S** key to add a keyframe.

	The camera will now move from our first keyframe to our second keyframe, pushing in on the Character. 

1.	In the **Sequencer Editor**, click the **Render Movie** button.

	The **Render Movie Settings** window will open.

1.	Under the **Capture Settings**, click the **Output Format** option to view the available options, then select **Video Sequence**.

	In addition to rendering your sequence out as a movie, you can also render it as an Image Sequence or render out Custom Render Passes. 

1.	Under **General**, choose an **Output Directory** to save your cinematic to, then click **Capture Movie**.

	A preview window will appear while the rendering process occurs.

	[REGION:note]
	If prompted to **Save** your content after selecting **Capture Movie**, click **Save** or **Don't Save** to continue. Selecting **Cancel** will abort the rendering process. 
	[/REGION]


## End Result

After the capture process, you will have a video file of your cinematic sequence (below is our rendered out cinematic).

You can also include **Burn-ins** or create [Custom Burn-ins](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/CustomBurnIns) (which are overlays that are embedded with your video) by enabling the **Use Burn In** option.

This can be useful if you are doing reviews of a cinematic as it will display timecode information as well as shot names or any custom information you want to provide.
