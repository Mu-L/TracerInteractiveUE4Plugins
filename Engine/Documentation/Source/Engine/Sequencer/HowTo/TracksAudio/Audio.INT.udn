Whether you are looking to score your cinematic with a musical track, or whether you want to add sound effects (such as impact sounds and voice overs), you'll need to do it with an **Audio Track** inside of **Sequencer**. 
Sequencer's Audio Track also enables you to adjust the Volume or Pitch of your audio assets at any point during your cinematic with keyframed value changes. 

In this how-to guide, you'll add a music track to a sample scene and fade it in over time (as well as adjust the pitch during the cinematic).

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to guide, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** with **Starter Content** enabled. 
[/REGION]

1.	From the Main Tool Bar, click **Cinematics** and **Add Level Sequence**.

1.	In the **Save Asset As** window, choose a save location and save name, then click **Save**.

1.	In the **Level Sequence**, click the **Add** button, and then select **Audio Track**.

1.	On the **Audio Track**, click the **+** button, then search for and add the **Starter_Music_Cue** asset.

	*	You can click the **Expand** icon to expand out and see your audio sub-tracks.

	*	You can add additional sub-tracks to the Audio Track by clicking the **+** button. You can then drag the additional sub-tracks along the timeline to reposition them where you want in your sequence.

1.	Expand the **Starter_Music_Cue** track, then change the **Volume** and **Pitch Multiplier** values to **0.0** and add keys for both.

	[REGION:note]
	This will turn the Volume to off, and set the Pitch to low. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Scrub the Timeline marker (ahead) to frame **50**, change the **Volume** and **Pitch Multiplier** values to **1.0**, and then add keys for both. 

	![](Audio08.png)

	[REGION:note]
	This will turn the Volume up to its default value (on), and the Pitch to its default value (not affecting the sound asset). 
	[/REGION]

1.	You can delete sub-tracks within the Audio Track by clicking on them in the Timeline window, and then pressing **Delete** (or **Right-click** and **Delete**).

1.	Return the Timeline to **0**, then click the **Play** button inside of Sequencer to play your sequence.

## End Result

When you play the Level Sequence, you will hear the audio fade in, with the pitch adjusting as the sequence begins.

While this example is fairly simple, you can add more keyframes to fade in (or fade out) audio at any point during your sequence, or you can adjust the pitch of audio assets as you desire. 
Audio Tracks support either **Sound Cue** or **Sound Wave** assets, which can be added by dragging-and-dropping from the **Content Browser** into a Level Sequence, or by adding through the **Add** option of an Audio Track.
