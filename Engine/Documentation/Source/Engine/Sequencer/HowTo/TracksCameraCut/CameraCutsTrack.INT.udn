Once you have content in your cinematic, you may want to shoot that content from different camera perspectives. 
In Sequencer, you can do this with the **Camera Cuts Track** and selecting which cameras to use at a given time in your scene. 

In this example we will use the Camera Cuts Track to cycle between cameras as if two characters were talking to one another. 

## Steps

[REGION:note]
For this how-to, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template** project with **Starter Content Enabled**. 
[/REGION]

1.	In the viewport, select the **ThirdPersonCharacter** and **Delete** it from the level.

	This is the playable character if we were playing the game which we will not need for this example. 

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh**, drag the **SK_Mannequin** into the level.

1.	Hold **Alt** and drag out a copy of the **SK_Mannequin**. 

	![](cameras03.png)

1.	Press **E** and rotate the second SK_Mannequin so it is facing the first. 

	![](cameras04.png)

	We will shot an example scene between these two mannequins and alternate camera perspectives from each mannequin. 

1.	From the Main Tool Bar, click the **Cinematics** drop-down menu and select **Add Level Sequence**. 

	![](cameras05.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and select both mannequins, then in Sequencer click **Add** and select **Add Current Selection**. 

	![](cameras06.png)

	This will add both Skeletal Mesh Actors to Sequencer which we can then animate. 

1.	Add the **ThirdPersonIdle** for each by clicking the **+ Animation** button on each Animation Track.

	Optionally, you can stretch out the idle animations to the length of the scene so they continue to idle.

1.	From the **Modes** panel under **Cinematic**, drag a **Cine Camera Actor** into the level. 

	![](cameras08.png)

1.	Press **Ctrl+Shift+P** to **Pilot** the camera and position it over the shoulder of one mannequin. 

	![](cameras10.png)

	With **Right Mouse Button** held and **WASD** you can fly around the level and view the perspective the camera will take. This makes it easier to frame up your shots exactly as you wish as you get a better indication of what it will look like. 

	You can exit **Pilot** mode by click the **Eject** button. 

	![](cameras11.png)

1.	Select and Pilot the other camera over the other mannequin's shoulder. 

	![](cameras12.png)

1.	Hold **Ctrl** and select both cameras, then add them to Sequencer. 

	![](cameras13.png)

1.	Click the **Add** button and select **Camera Cut Track**. 

	![](cameras14.png)

1.	Click the **+ Camera** button and select one of the cameras. 

	![](cameras15.png)

	The names of your cameras may differ than the image above. 

1.	Move the Timeline Marker to frame **50**, then click the **+ Camera** button and add the other camera. 

	![](cameras16.png)

1.	Move the Timeline Marker to frame **100**, then click the **+ Camera** button and add the camera used in step 13.

	![](cameras17.png)

1.	Change the **Viewport Type** to **Cinematic Viewport**. 

	![](cameras20.png)

1.	Click the **Lock Viewport to Camera Cuts** button on the **Camera Cuts Track**. 

	![](cameras19.png)

	This will tell the cinematic to use this track and its cameras to view the scene.

1.	Click the **Play** button in the viewport to preview the scene. 
	

## End Result

During playback, you should see the camera perspective change to the two cameras used in the Camera Cuts Track.

In the video above, we also entered **Game View** (**G** key in the viewport) to hide the cameras from being displayed during playback. 

You can also use the **Add Camera** shortcut to add and assign a camera in a Camera Cuts Track in one click.

Also, you will automatically enter Pilot Mode for the camera you added!
