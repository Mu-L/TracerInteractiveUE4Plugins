In the previous step, we added a camera and provided a path for our camera to take and adjusted some of the Camera's settings. 
In this step, we replace the **Character Blueprint** that is used with the template project with a **Skeletal Mesh** Actor that we can apply animations to, completing our first shot.

## Steps

1. In the **Content Browser**, navigate to the **Content/Mannequin/Character/Mesh** folder and click on **SK_Mannequin**.

1. In the left Viewport, right-click on the Character in the Level and choose **Replace Selected Actors with** and choose **SK_Mannequin**.

	 This will replace the default **Character Blueprint** used for gameplay with a **Skeletal Mesh** Actor. 

1.	In the left Viewport, use the **Transform Tools** to move the **Skeletal Mesh** down to the ground and rotate it forward.

	You can click the icons at the top of the viewport to switch between Location and Rotation options and can disable **Grid Snapping** to get more precise movement. 

1.	With the **Skeletal Mesh** still selected, in **Sequencer** click the **Track** button, then select **Actor To Sequencer** and **Add ThirdPersonCharacter**.

	This will add a reference to the **Skeletal Mesh** in the Level to Sequencer so that we can control it within Sequencer. 

1.	For the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Track, click the **+ Animation** button then search for and add the **ThirdPersonIdle** animation.

	The **Skeletal Mesh** in the Level will assume an Idle pose and the Track will be added to Sequencer. 

1.	Left-click and drag the end of the **ThirdPersonIdle** animation to the right so it loops and fills the entire **150** frames.

1.	On the **Camera Cuts** track, click the **Unlock/Lock Camera** button.

	Locking the Camera on a Camera Cuts Track, will only affect **Cinematic Viewports**.

1.	Jump to the beginning of the Sequence, then click the **Preview Play** button in the Cinematic Viewport to play the sequence. 



## End Result

The focal point of our cinematic has been added and we have applied and looped an animation for the Character to use.

In the next step, we will work on another shot for our scene before we add both shots to our **Master** track.
