Now that you have completed your first shot, let's take what we have learned and create another!

This time we will push the camera in from the front of our Character in on their face. 

## Steps

1.	In the **Content Browser**, select the **Shot01** Level Sequence and press **Ctrl+W** to duplicate it.

	This will automatically take all the content from **Shot01** and add it to **Shot02** and name it for us. 

1.	Inside **Shot02**, delete the existing **CineCameraActor** and click the **Add Camera** button.

	Here we are replacing the first camera with a new camera that we will cut to from our **Master** track a little later in this guide. 

1.	Move the camera around in the **Cinematic Viewport** to the front of the **Skeletal Mesh** Actor in the Level.

	The name of your **Cine Camera Actor** may differ from above which is perfectly fine.

1.	Select the **CineCameraActor** track in Sequencer and press the **S** key to add a keyframe for the Camera's Transform.

	Your value might be different from above based on where you placed the camera.

1.	Click the **To End** button in the Cinematic Preview to jump to the end of the Sequence. 

1.	Move the camera in on the Character then add a keyframe (**S** key) for the position.

1.	In the **Details** panel for the camera, use the **Eye Dropper** on the Character in the Level then add a keyframe for the new value.

	You should have keyframes at the start for the initial position and focus value as well as at the end.

1.	Click the **Camera Lock** toggle button on the **Camera Cuts** track to enable the Cinematic Preview.

1.	Move to the start of the Sequence, then click the **Preview Play** button in the **Cinematic Viewport**. 


## End Result

We have set up our second shot of our sequence where the camera starts from far away and pushes in on the Character.

In our next step, we tie our shots together using the **Shot Track** in our Master Level Sequence. We also create a **Take** (or variation) of one of our shots that we can quickly swap in or out. 
You will also see how we can arrange or re-arrange the order of shots in our scene as we get a little bit closer to finishing our sample scene.
