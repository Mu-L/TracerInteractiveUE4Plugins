Now that you have created a sample cinematic with Sequencer, you can try several of the How-to's to add to this scene. 

Try some of the following on your own: 

* Try to fade the scene in/out using a [Fade Track](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/TracksFade). 
* Make the Character in the level walk using [Character Animation](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/CharacterAnimation).
* Add Music from the **Content/StarterContent/Audio** folder with an [Audio Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksAudio). 
* Add a [Crane](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\CameraRigCrane) or [Rail](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\CameraRigRail) shot to the scene. 
* Cause the scene to enter slow motion with the [Play Rate](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksPlayRate) track.
