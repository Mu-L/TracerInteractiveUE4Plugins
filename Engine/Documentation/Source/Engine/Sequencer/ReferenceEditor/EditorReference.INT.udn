This page outlines the interface elements and options contained with the Sequencer Editor such as the **Tree View** where you select the types of tracks to use in **Sequencer** to the **Tracks Area** where you keyframe property changes for your tracks that ultimately shape your cinematic. 
Regardless of the type of cinematic you wish to create, this page will help you gain an understanding of each of the different interface elements within Sequencer and the available options. 



## Sequencer Editor Interface

## Sequencer Curve Editor

When working with tangents inside the Curve Editor, weighted tangents are supported on float curves as depicted below.  

![](WeightedCurves_03.gif "WeightedCurves_03.gif")

The Curve Editor also supports continuous Euler Angle changes when changing rotations. Euler angles are not limited to -180, 180, which is necessary to avoid flips in animation. 

You can turn on **Quaternion Rotation** on a 3D Transform section through the track's **Properties **menu to utilize quaternion interpolation to smoothly interpolate between two rotations.

## Sequence Breadcrumbs

Depending on your workflow, you may choose to create several **Level Sequences** as scenes and place each of those scenes in a new Level Sequence which is your "master" Level Sequence which plays those scenes back-to-back as part of a **Shots** track. 
In these instances, you can jump from your master Level Sequence directly into each scene by double-clicking on them inside the Tracks Area. 

In the image below, we have a Level Sequence inside another Level Sequence which is our "master" sequence.

![](SequenceBreadcrumbs1.png)

We can click the breadcrumbs at the top to return to our master Level Sequence containing all of our shots.

![](SequenceBreadcrumbs2.png)

## Add / Filter Tracks

The **Track** button allows you to add **Tracks** or [Actors](Engine/Actors) from your level to **Sequencer** which you can then use to craft your cinematic.

![](AddOption.png)

When you have an Actor in the level selected, clicking the **Track** button and looking under **Actor to Sequencer**, the Actor you have selected will be displayed at the very top of the context menu enabling you to quickly add it. 
If you do not have an Actor in the level selected, when clicking **Actor to Sequencer** you can still choose any other Actor that exists in the level from the context menu. 

Below are the available Tracks you can add to Sequencer, click each link below to view a How-to page for an example using each Track.


| Tracks | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| Add Folder | You can add folders to contain your Tracks for organizational purposes.  |
| [Audio Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksAudio) | Adds a master audio track which can be used to play sounds. |
| [Event Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksEvent) | Adds an Event Track which can be used to signal and kick off Blueprint Script (currently only in the Level Blueprint). |
| [Camera Cut Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksCameraCut) | Allows you to switch between cameras associated with Sequencer and provide a camera perspective. |
| [Shot Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksShot) | Allows you to add Level Sequences as "shots" which can have **Takes** that can be swapped in/out. |
| [Play Rate Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksPlayRate) | Adds a track which can be used to manipulate the playback rate of the sequence. |
| [Subscenes Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksSub) | Adds a sub track which can contain other Level Sequences. This is useful for creating multiple copies of a sequence that different users can work from without altering the original sequence. |
| [Fade Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksFade) | Adds a track that will allow you to control the fading in/out of the sequence.  |
| [Level Visibility Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksLevelVisibility) | This can be used to keyframe and control the visibility of your level. |
| [Material Parameter Collection Track](Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/TracksMaterialParameter) | This track can be used to drive Material Parameter Collections within Sequencer. |

The **Filter** option allows you to filter the **Tree View** for only Actors that have been added to the sequence from the level.

## Timeline

![](Timeline.png)

The **Timeline** indicates the playback range of your sequence with **Green** (Start) and **Red** (End) markers. The current time of your sequence is indicated by the Timeline Marker which you can scrub by left-click dragging along the Timeline.

You can right-click on the Timeline to define new Start/Stop points from the context menu as depicted below. 

![](Timeline2.png)

[REGION:tip]
Your sequence will continue to play from the start marker all the way to the end marker even if your content does not fully reach the end of the sequence (or exceeds past the end marker). Inside the **Playback Options**, there is an option to keep your content inside the section bounds which will ensure there is no dead space during your sequence. 

![](KeepInSectionBounds.png)
[/REGION]


## Tree View

The **Tree View** is where you determine what types of actions you want to perform during your sequence. 

![](tracks1.png)

Above we have a **Camera Cuts** track for switching camera angles during our sequence, a **Cine Camera Actor** to provide the view for a scene, and two **Skeletal Mesh Actors** which are the characters in our scene.

Sequencer is context sensitive and will allow you to add Sub-Tracks (where applicable) to each track that will provide you with additional options.
For example, in the image below we have added a **CameraComponent** track to our Cine Camera Actor which gives us the ability to add another Sub-Track to adjust some of the properties of the camera during our scene if we desire. 

![](tracks2.png)

You can also add Keyframes from the Tree View for your tracks to define properties at a specific point on the Timeline.

![](AddKeyFrameButton.png)

You can click the **+** keyframe button or press the **Enter** key with a Track selected. 


## Tracks Area

![](KeyframeWindow.png)

They **Tracks Area** is where you adjust the content in each of your Tracks. You can adjust any keyframes you have added, trim/split or taper in/out of sections as well as several other options that are available from the **Right-click** context menu (pictured below). 

![](RightClickContext1.png)

Above, **Right-clicking** on a keyframe for a Transformation track gives the ability to change the key interpolation type as well as other options that can be adjusted from the **Properties** roll-out which updates based on the type of content your Right-click on. 

Below, **Right-clicking** on an Animation assigned to an Animation Track and selecting properties gives us the ability to change the currently assigned animation as well as adjust properties related to the animation itself such as start/end offsets and play rate and more.

## Playback Controls

![](PlaybackControls.png)

The **Playback Controls** can be found in the bottom lower-left corner of the Sequencer Editor and are similar to standard media player applications. With the default Unreal Editor layout, there is also the same playback controls displayed in the main Level Viewport. Finally, when using a [Cinematic Viewport](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\ViewportOptions), the playback controls will appear inside the viewport. 

Standard Playback Controls are as follows: 

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ![](playback1.png) | Set the playback start position to the current position indicated by the Time Marker. |
| ![](playback2.png) | Jump to the playback start position. |
| ![](playback3.png) | Jump to the previous key in the selected track(s).|
| ![](playback4.png) | Jump to the previous frame. |
| ![](playback5.png) | Play or Pause the Level Sequence from the position of the Time Marker. |
| ![](playback6.png) | Jump forward a frame. |
| ![](playback7.png) | Jump to the next key in the selected track(s).|
| ![](playback8.png) | Jump to the playback end position. |
| ![](playback9.png) | Set the playback end position to the current position indicated by the Time Marker. |
|![](playback10b.png) / ![](playback10.png) | Toggles between looping the Level Sequence during playback. |

[REGION:note]
The Playback Controls inside a Cinematic Viewport function the same as above.
