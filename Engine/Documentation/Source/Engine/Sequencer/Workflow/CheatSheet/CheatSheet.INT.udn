## Workflow Shortcuts

The following shortcuts can be used to improve adding content to Sequencer. 

### Auto Add to Sequencer

You can automatically add objects to Sequencer when dragging them into the viewport from the **Modes** panel or **Content Browser** provided you have a Level Sequence open. 

![](Workflow.png)

| Command | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Ctrl + Drag** asset into viewport | This will automatically add the object to Sequencer. |
| **Shift + Drag** asset into viewport | This will automatically add the object to Sequencer as a **Spawnable**. |

[REGION:note]
You can also drag assets directly into Sequencer which will add them as a [**Spawnable**](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\Spawnables). 
[/REGION]

When dragging in the **Camera Rig Crane** or **Camera Rig Rail** assets from the **Modes** panel with either method above, a **Cine Camera Actor** will also automatically be created and attached before adding both to Sequencer. 
Additionally, a **Camera Cuts** track will also automatically be created in the open Level Sequence and the new Cine Camera Actor will also be assigned which can be a fast workflow for setting up a shot with the crane or rail. 

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]

[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:height]
360
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]

Above we created a **Level Sequence** then **Ctrl** dragged in the **Camera Rig Crane** and **Camera Rig Rail** assets. 


### Quick Add Camera Option
