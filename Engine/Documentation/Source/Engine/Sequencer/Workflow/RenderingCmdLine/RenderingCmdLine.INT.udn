[TOC(start:2 end:2)]

This page outlines the various [Command Line Arguments](Programming/Basics/CommandLineArguments) and [Console Variables](Programming/Development/Tools/ConsoleManager) you can use to determine what settings are used when rendering out your Sequences. 


[REGION:note]
If you have not launched Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Editor from a command line, see the [](GettingStarted/RunningUnrealEngine) page for more information.

## Required Commands

These commands are required to render out an image sequence correctly. Include these anytime you are rendering from a command line: 

| Argument | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| -MovieSceneCaptureType="/Script/MovieSceneCapture.AutomatedLevelSequenceCapture" | Used to define many of the command line arguments listed on this page.  |
| -LevelSequence="/Game/PathToSequence/SequenceName" | Tells the Editor which sequence to play. |
| -NoLoadingScreen | The game instance of the Editor will fail to render properly without this. |

## Control Commands

These are some of the recommended command line arguments to give you full control over image quality, rendering parameters, and file naming/type. 

The **Usage** column includes recommendations on when to use the command line argument:

| Argument | Description | Notes | Usage |
| ---- | ----------- |----------- |----------- |
| -ResX=#### | Set horizontal resolution for the game window. | Eg: -ResX=1920 | Lower res for previews, Higher for final. |
| -ResY=#### | Set vertical resolution for the game window. | Eg: -ResY=1080 | Lower res for previews, Higher for final. |
| -ForceRes | Forces the window to the specified resolution, even when larger than the screen resolution. | | |
| -VSync | Activate the VSYNC via command line. | High Perf cost, but doesn't hurt us since we aren't rendering in real-time. | Final Renders. |
| -NoVSync | Deactivate the VSYNC via command line. | See the "Notes" entry in the -VSync row (located above this cell). | Preview Renders. |
| -MovieFrameRate=30 | Sets the frame rate of the output. | Overrides the default of 30fps. | Depends on the needs of your cinematic (for example: rhythmic movement suffers when using a low FPS. This could be unwanted even in Previews). |
| -NoTextureStreaming | Disables texture streaming. | Will take longer to render, but worth it for final renders. | Final Renders. |
| -MovieFolder="PATH" | Destination folder for rendered images. | Defaults to Project/Saved/Screenshots. | Recommended when batch rendering. Otherwise all image files dump into the same folder. |
| -MovieFormat=ASD | Media format. JPG, BMP, PNG, or Video. | Defaults to PNG. | |
| -MovieQuality=## | Sets the compression quality. | Expressed in a percentage, defaults to 75. | |
| -MovieName="Example.{frame}" | Sets the naming format for the output files. | [INCLUDE:Engine\Sequencer\Workflow\RenderingCmdLine#wildcard] | Definitely recommended for batch rendering. Gives the files a unique name corresponding to the map name, render pass, etc. |
| -MovieCinematicMode=Yes/No | Enables Cinematic Mode. | Hides Player Character and disables Player Character Movement. Also disables the HUD. | Usually a good idea to enable this all the time. |
| -MovieWarmUpFrames=## | Number of frames to run the scene before playing the sequence. This will not play out in real-time. | Default of 0 frames. This will also run the frames before the beginning of your sequence's play range. | Useful when you have Particle Systems or physics that need to simulate before you begin recording. |
| -MovieDelayBeforeWarmUp=#  | Number of seconds before the Warm-up Begins. Runs in real-time. |  | If you need to do anything with your Pawn before the sequence starts. |
| -MovieStartFrame=###  | Overrides the start frame of your sequence. | Defaults to the in and out markers in Sequencer. | |
| -MovieEndFrame=###  | Overrides the end frame of your sequence. | Defaults to the in and out markers in Sequencer. | |
| -NoScreenMessages  | Hides on-screen messages like "Rebuild Lighting" or "Print String" outputs. | | |

[EXCERPT:Wildcard]
[REGION:simpletable]
| Wildcard | Description |
| ----- | ------ |
| {fps} | The captured framerate. |
| {frame}| The current frame number (only relevant for image sequences). |
| {width}| The width of the captured frames. |
| {height}| The height of the captured frames. |
| {world}| The name of the current world. |
| {quality}| The image compression quality setting. |
| {material}| The material/render pass. |

## Custom Render Passes

Using these commands requires `-MovieFormat=CustomRenderPasses` and `{material}` in the `-MovieName`.

| Argument | Description | Notes |
| ---- | ----------- |----------- |
| -CustomRenderPasses="RenderPassName" | Sets the custom render Pass. | Options are (exclude parenthesis): AmbientOcclusion, BaseColor, CustomDepth, CustomDepthWorldUnits, CustomStencil, FinalImage, MaterialAO (Ambient Occlusion), Metallic, Opacity, PostTonemapHDRColor, Roughness, SceneColor, SceneDepth, SceneDepthWorldUnits, SeparateTranslucencyA (Alpha), SeparateTranslucencyRGB, ShadingModel, Specular, SubsurfaceColor, WorldNormal. |
| -CaptureFramesInHDR | Renders with HDR in the .exr format. | |
| -HDRCompressionQuality=## | Compression Quality for HDR Frames (0 for no compression, 1 for default compression which can be slow). This is dependent on -CaptureFramesInHDR. | |
| -CaptureGamut="HCGM_Name" | The color gamut to use when storing HDR captured data. This is dependent on -CaptureFramesInHDR. | (See Capture Gamut Descriptions below) HCGM_Rec709, HCGM_P3DCI, HCGM_Rec2020, HCGM_ACES, HCGM_ACEScg, HCGM_MAX. |
| -PostProcessingMaterial="MaterialPath" | The Custom Post Processing Material to use for rendering. | Format looks like: "Material'/Engine/BufferVisualization/SceneDepth.SceneDepth'" An easy way to get that path is to right-click the Material in the Content Browser and select Copy Reference. |

* Capture Gamut Descriptions
	* HCGM_Rec709 - Rec. 709 / sRGB
	* HCGM_P3DCI - P3 D65
	* HCGM_Rec2020 - Rec. 2020
	* HCGM_ACES - ACES
	* HCGM_ACEScg - ACEScg


## Console Variables

The following console variables can be useful for determining the quality of your renders and can be added your `DefaultEngine.ini` in your **Game/Config** folder of your project. 

[REGION:note]
The values used below are the recommended values for highest quality. 
[/REGION]

| Variable | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| r.ForceLOD=0 | Forces all LODs to 0, whereas -1 turns it off. |
| r.MotionBlurQuality=4 | Defines the motion blur method (adjust for quality or performance): 0 is off, 1 is low, 2 is medium, 3 is high (default), 4 is very high. |
| r.MotionBlurSeparable=1 | Adds a second motion blur pass that smooths noise for a higher quality blur. 0 is off, 1 is on. |
| r.DepthOfFieldQuality=4 | Allows adjusting of the Depth of Field quality. Currently only fully affects BokehDOF. GaussianDOF is either 0 for off, otherwise on. [INCLUDE:Engine\Sequencer\Workflow\RenderingCmdLine#dofquality] |
| r.HLOD=0 | Single argument: 0 or 1 to Disable/Enable HLOD System. Multiple arguments: force X where X is the HLOD level that should be forced into view. |
| r.SSR.Quality=4| Whether to use screen space reflections and at what quality setting. Limits the setting in the post process settings which has a different scale. Costs performance, adds more visual realism but the technique has limits.  [INCLUDE:Engine\Sequencer\Workflow\RenderingCmdLine#ssrquality]  |
| r.ViewDistanceScale=30 | Controls the view distance scale. A primitive's MaxDrawDistance is scaled by this value. Higher values will increase view distance but at a performance cost. |
| r.MipMapLODBias=-1 | Apply additional mip map bias for all 2D textures, range of -15.0 to 15.0. |
| r.Shadow.MaxResolution=4096 | Max square dimensions (in texels) allowed for rendering shadow depths. Range 4 to hardware limit. Higher = better quality shadows but at a performance cost. |

## Examples

In this section, we provide a few sample command line arguments for different situations. 
In the examples provided, we consider the following the specifics related to our project. 

* Build Location = C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\4.##\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe
* Project Location = D:\Unreal Projects\SequencerTestBed\SequencerTestBed.uproject
* Map Name = TestRender_Map.umap
* Sequence Name = Test_Render_SQ

### Preview Render
Here is an example for a 16:9 preview render at 30fps with a resolution of 1280x720 in the .jpg file format. 

	"C:\Program Files (x86)\Epic Games\4.##\Engine\Binaries\Win64\UE4Editor.exe" "D:\Unreal Projects\SequencerTestBed\SequencerTestBed.uproject" /Game/TestRender/TestRender_Map -game -MovieSceneCaptureType="/Script/MovieSceneCapture.AutomatedLevelSequenceCapture" -LevelSequence="/Game/Test_Render/Test_Render_SQ" -MovieFrameRate=30 -noloadingscreen -resx=1280 -resy=720 -MovieFormat=JPG -MovieQuality=75
