The **Sequence Recorder** allows you to record Actor(s) from gameplay or level editing into Skeletal Animation, Transform, Event and Audio Tracks inside a Level Sequence. 
You can then edit the Level Sequence inside the **Sequencer Editor** to create a cinematic based around your recording. 

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]


## Opening the Sequence Recorder

You can open the Sequence Recorder from the main **Menu Bar** under the **Window** tab: 

![](EnableSequenceWindow.png)

After selecting Sequence Recorder, the Sequence Recorder window will open:

## Tracking Actors for Recording

Across the top of the Sequence Recorder are three buttons: Record, Add and Remove. 

![](RecorderToolbar1.png)

These are used to start recording, add Actors to track for recording or remove Actors from the recording list. 
After clicking the **Add** button, both the **Record** option as well as the **Remove** option will become accessible. 
This will also add an **Actor Recording** field to the Actor Tracking window with the Actor to track listed as **None** (shown below). 

![](RecorderToolbar2.png)

Selecting the Actor Recording will populate the Sequence Recorder with additional options (highlighted below) related to that recording.

![](SequenceRecorderWindow.png)

With these options you can define what Actor to track during the recording along with its animation settings. 
You can add multiple Actor Tracking fields to the Tracking Window, with each **Actor to Record** set to track different Actors.

Please see the [](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\SequenceRecorder) page for a step-by-step guide to recording Actors with the Sequence Recorder.

## Sequence Recorder Options

Once you have the Sequence Recorder open, there are several properties you can adjust to determine how the Sequence Recorder records its Actors. 
When first opening the Sequence Recorder, you will only be presented with the default **Sequence Recording** options. After adding Actor(s) to track for recording, the **Actor Recording** and **Animation Recording** sections become available on a per Actor basis. 

Please see each of the tables below for a list of properties along with a description of each:

### Sequence Recording

| Option | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Create Level Sequence** | Whether to create a Level Sequence when recording or not. Actors and animations will be inserted into this sequence if enabled. |
| **Immersive Mode** | Whether to maximize the viewport when recording. |
| **Sequence Length** | Defines the maximum length of the sequence to record (setting to 0 recording will continue until Stop is invoked). |
| **Recording Delay** | Delay that will be used before starting the recording. |
| **Sequence Name** | The name of the sequence to record to. This name will also be used to auto-generate any assets created by this recording. |
| **Sequence Recording Base Path** | Defines the location within the project to save the recording. Sub-assets will be created in subdirectories within the base path specified. |
| **Record Nearby Spawned Actors** | Whether or not to record nearby spawned Actors as part of this recording. |
| **Nearby Actor Recording Proximity** | Defines the proximity to currently recorded Actors to record newly spawned Actors. |
| **Record World Settings Actor** | Whether to record the World Settings Actor in the sequence (some games use this to attach world SFX). |
| **Actor Filter** | Filter to check spawned Actors against to see if they should be recorded. You can specify which Actor classes to record from the expandable option. |
| **Level Sequence Actors to Trigger** | Sequence Actors to trigger playback on when recording starts (for example, this can be used for recording synchronized sequences). |
| **Default Animation Settings** | The default settings applied to animation recording. Expand to see options for recording in World Space, Removing Root Animation whether or not to Auto Save the asset when recording is complete and the ability to Sample Rate and Length.  |
| **Classes and Properties to Record** | The properties to record for specified classes. Component classes specified here will be recorded. If an Actor does not contain one of these classes it will be ignored. Expanded to define the classes and associated properties. |
| **Animation Sub Directory** | The name of the subdirectory animations will be placed in. Leave this empty to place them into the same directory as the Sequence base path. |
| **Record Sequencer Spawned Actors** | Whether to record Actors that are spawned by Sequencer itself (this is usually disabled as results can be unexpected). |
| **Per Actor Settings** | Settings applied to Actors of a specified class. For each class you can define whether to record to a possessable (level-owned) or spawnable (sequence-owned).  |

### Actor Recording

| Option | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Record Visibility** | Whether to record the Actors visibility or not. |
| **Record Transforms** | Whether to record Actor transforms. This can be useful if you want the Actors to end up in specific locations after the sequence. By default we rely on animations to provide transforms, but this can be changed using the **Record in World Space** animation setting. |
| **Actor to Record** | This option is used to define which Actor you want to record. |

### Animation Recording

| Option | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| **Specify Target Animation** | Whether we should specify the target animation or auto-create it. |
| **Target Animation** | Enabled when **Specify Target Animation** is enabled and is used to specify the animation you want to record to. |
| **Animation Settings** | See **Default Animation Settings** under **Sequence Recording**. These are applied to the **Actor to Record**.  |
| **Record to Possessable** | Whether to record possessable (level-owned) or spawnable (sequence-owned) Actors. Defaults to the global setting. |


## Tips & Tricks

This section contains some workflow tips & tricks you can use when working with the Sequence Recorder. 

### Continuous Recording

In the **Sequence Recorder** window, you can set the **Sequence Length** to **0** to perform continuous recording. 

![](NoLength.png)

When set to 0, recording will not stop unless you manually choose to stop recording by hitting the **Esc** key. 


### Right-click Recording

If you have an active **Level Sequence** open, rather than clicking the **Add** button inside the Sequence Recorder, you can **Right-click** on an Actor in your level and initiate recording of the Actor from the context menu (or press **Alt + R**). 
This will add the Actor to the Actor Tracking window of the Sequence Recorder and automatically start recording after the set **Recording Delay** expires. 

![](RightClickRecord.png)

[REGION:note]
Please note that this will initiate Editor Recording and not [Gameplay Recording](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\SequenceRecorder) with the Sequence Recorder.

### Subscene Recording Gameplay

Using the Sequence Recorder to record gameplay will (by default) automatically create a new Level Sequence to record the content to. 
If you already have a Level Sequence that you want to add recorded content to, you can do so with the use of a [Subscene Track](Engine\Sequencer\HowTo\TracksSub) and recording the current player pawn. 

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
[PARAMLITERAL:width]
640
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:height]
360
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
Wab8bB69TIo
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]

Above we create a new Level Sequence along with a Subscene Track, then during gameplay we hit **Shift + F1** to gain Mouse Control and add a primed Recorded Sequence based on our current player pawn. 
When can then press the **Record** button in the viewport while playing our game to start recording and hit **Esc** to end recording. 

[REGION:note]
Recording in this fashion is the same as manually adding the **Actor to Record** through the Sequence Recorder window and starting to Record from within the Sequence Recorder.
One thing to keep in mind is that the settings defined inside the Sequence Recorder will be used when using this method of Subscene Recording.

### Recording Class Properties

Want to record a change in a specific property value for an Actor during your Sequence Recording? 
You can use the **Classes and Properties to Record** setting in the Sequence Recorder window to specify which class and its associated property (or properties) you want to track for recording.

![](PropertyRecording.png)

If that property changes at all during recording it will automatically be keyframed reflecting the changes during the recording. 
If the Actor you are tracking does not contain one of the defined classes it will just be ignored. 

By default, Sequence Recorder includes the following classes to track for recording: 

* SkeletalMeshComponent
* StaticMeshComponent
* ParticleSystemComponent
* LightComponent
* CameraComponent
* CineCameraComponent

You can use these classes and track properties within them during your recording or you can delete them and use your own classes. 



### Recording to Possessable

By default when you elect to perform a recording the Actors you have tagged for tracking will automatically have a **Spawnable** version of that Actor created and added to your recording. 
While the Spawnable version will only exist while the Level Sequence is open, there may be times when you want to "write" directly to an Actor in your level instead of creating a new Spawnable. 
You can do so by checking the **Record to Possessable** option under the **Animation Recording** section in the Sequence Recorder. 

![](RecordToPossessable.png)

Checking this option will no longer create a Spawnable but instead will be using a Possessable Actor to apply the recording to. 

[REGION:note]
Please see [Possessables vs. Spawnables](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Sequencer/Overview/index.html#possessablesvsstopspawnables) for more information on each.
[/REGION]
### Immersive Mode

When recording your gameplay, you may want a larger viewport to "play" your game while recording. 
The **Immersive Mode** option inside the Sequence Recorder window will automatically maximize your viewport for you while recording is active. 

![](ImmersiveMode.png)

Once you stop recording, the viewport will return back to its normal size.
