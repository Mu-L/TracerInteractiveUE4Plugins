The **Developer Tools** provide you with several information gathering tools such as debuggers, analyzers, profilers, and more. 
Using these tools can help in your optimization efforts or to diagnose aspects of your project, code or content that may not be performing as expected. 

You can access the Developer Tools from the **File** Menu under **Window** and **Developer Tools**.

The Developer Tools are broken up into three categories: 

* Debug - which houses debugging tools.

* Miscellaneous - which includes loggers, mangers, profiles and others.
