The **Pixel Inspector** tool is a Developer Tool that will allow you to diagnose the pixels that make up the colors in your scene. 
If you want to know why a pixel is producing an unexpected color (or maybe what Material input is driving a pixel's color), you can use the Pixel Inspector's **Inspect Mode** to output information that is driving the pixel's visual result. 

## Using the Pixel Inspector

To enable and use the Pixel Inspector:

1. From the Main Editor Window go to the **Window** menu option under **Developer Tools** and select **Pixel Inspector**.
