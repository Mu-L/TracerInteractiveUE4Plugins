## Preferences

### Controls

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Flight Camera Control type** | This setting determines whether the flight camera is used and how it is accessed. The flight camera uses the W, A, S, and D keys to dolly and pan the camera, similar to how standard FPS controls work. W and S dolly the camera in and out, while A and D pan, or strafe, the camera side to side. When active, this overrides any hotkeys using these controls, including toggling show flags. [INCLUDE:#CameraControls] |
| **Grab and Drag to Move Orthographic Cameras** | If enabled, clicking the Left or Right Mouse Buttons and dragging the mouse in an orthographic viewport will scroll the camera. Essentially what this means in practice is when you click and drag, the scene will move with the mouse. With this disabled, the scene moves opposite of the mouse. |
| **Orthographic Zoom to Cursor Position** | If enabled, zooming in the orthographic viewports will be centered around the mouse cursor. When disabled, zooming is centered on the center of the viewport. |
| **Link Orthographic Viewport Movement** | If enabled, all orthographic viewports will be linked to focus on the same position. So moving the camera in one orthographic viewport will cause the other orthographic viewports to follow. When disabled, all viewports can be navigated independently.  |
| **Aspect Ratio Axis Constraint** | Determines which axis of the perspective viewport is used to control the field of view (FOV) to maintain the aspect ratio when resizing. [INCLUDE:#AspectConstraint] |
| **Mouse Scroll Camera Speed** | Determines the speed at which the perspective camera moves when navigating with the mouse. |

### Viewport Look and Feel

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Highlight Objects Under Mouse Cursor** | If enabled, objects will be highlighted using a transparent overlay in viewports while hovering over them with the mouse cursor.

| **Use Selection Outline** | [INCLUDE:Shared/Types/ULevelEditorViewportSettings#buseselectionoutline] |
| **Selection Highlight Intensity** | [INCLUDE:Shared/Types/ULevelEditorViewportSettings#selectionhighlightintensity] |
| **Use Camera Location from Play-In-Viewport** | If enabled, the viewport camera will be set to the final location of the player's camera when exiting a Play In Viewport session. |
| **Use Absolute Translation** | If enabled, translation transformations are treated as absolute. When disabled, translations are considered relative to the prior location. |
| **Preview Selected Cameras** | If enabled, selecting a camera Actor will display a live _picture in picture_ preview from the camera's perspective within the current editor viewport.  This can be used to easily tweak camera positioning, post-processing and other settings without having to possess the camera itself. [REGION:warning]This feature may reduce application performance when enabled.[/REGION] |
| **Background Drop Distance** | The distance in Unreal Units from the camera to place Actors which are dropped on nothing in the viewport. |

### Editor Look and Feel

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Use Small Tool Bar Icons** | If enabled, toolbar icons across the whole editor will be smaller and without labels. [INCLUDE:#SmallToolBarIcons] |

### Level Editing

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Enable Combined translate/Rotate Widget** | [INCLUDE:Shared/Types/ULevelEditorViewportSettings#ballowtranslaterotatezwidget] |
| **Clicking BSP Enables Brush** | If enabled, clicking on a Brush surface selects the brush and **Ctrl + Shift + Click** selects the surface.  When disabled, the opposite is true; clicking selects the surface and **Ctrl + Shift + Click** selects the brush. |
| **Update BSP Automatically** | If enabled, Brush geometry rebuilds automatically when brushes are moved or modified in the viewport. When disabled, geometry must be rebuilt to see the changes. |
| **Preserve Actor Scale on Replace** | If enabled, replacing Actors will respect the scale of the original Actor.  Otherwise, the replaced Actors will have a scale of 1.0. |

### Source Control

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Prompt for Checkout on Package Modification** | If enabled, the editor will automatically prompt for SCC checkout on package modification. |
| **Allow Source Control** | If enabled, the editor source control integration for packages and maps is used. |
| **Add New Files when Modified** | If enabled, new files are automatically added to source control. |
| **Host** | The host and port for your source control server. Example: `hostname:1234` |
| **Username** | The user name to sue when connecting to source control. |
| **Workspace** | The clientspec for source control. |

### Particles

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Use Curves for Distributions** | If enabled, [Distributions](Engine/Basics/Distributions) will use the curves in place of the baked lookup tables when being rendered in the editor. |

### Content Browser

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Auto Reimport Textures** | If enabled, source files for textures are monitored and textures are automatically re-imported when the source file is modified. |
| **Assets to Load at Once before Warning** | The number of objects to load at once in the **Content Browser** before displaying a warning about loading many assets. |

### Auto Save

| Option | Description |
| ------ | ----------- |
| **Enable AutoSave** | If enabled, the editor will automatically perform a save operation at specified intervals. |
| **Save Maps** | If enabled, the auto-save procedure will attempt to save modified, loaded maps. |
| **Save Packages** | If enabled, the auto-save procedure will attempt to save modified content packages. |
| **Frequency in Minutes** | The time interval in minutes to wait between auto-saves. |
| **Warning in Seconds** | The number of seconds the warning is displayed before an auto-save is performed. ![](autosave_warning.png) |
