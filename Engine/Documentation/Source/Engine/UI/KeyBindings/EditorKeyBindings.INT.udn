[EXCERPT:Intro]
**Keyboard shortcuts** are combinations of key presses on your keyboard that execute specific commands or actions. Common commands, as well as those specific to the mainframe or other tools in Unreal Editor 4, are configurable. You can customize keyboard shortcuts in the Unreal Editor to suit your workflow and personal preferences by binding specific keys or key combinations to specific commands. 

You can set up your own set of custom keyboard shortcuts in the **Editor Preferences** window.  To modify the keyboard shortcuts, click **Editor Preferences** on the **Edit** menu, and then click **Keyboard Shortcuts**.
