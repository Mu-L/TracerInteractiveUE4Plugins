Description:Customized controls for viewing and modifying the materials applied to all components of an Actor.

The **Materials** category displays all the Materials applied to the Actor(s) that are selected, grouped by element. 
For example, a Static Mesh with 3 elements would display 3 Materials when selected.

| Control | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| ![](Details_Mat_ObjRef.png)| Standard [**Object reference**](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Details/Properties/ObjectReference) property controls for setting, finding, and resetting the assigned Material back to the base Material. Clicking the drop-down list that contains the Material's name and then clicking **Edit** on the context menu opens the Material in the Material Instance Editor for modification. |
| ![Material Thumbnail](button_Details_Mat_Image.png)| Thumbnail of the Material, which can be **double-clicked** to open the Material Instance in the Material Instance Editor for modification. |
| ![Find Texture](button_textures.png) | List of Textures used within the Material. Selecting a Texture from the list finds that Texture in the **Content Browser**. |

To save space, when many Actors are selected that contain different Materials for any element, a link is 
displayed that toggles display of all the Materials for that element.

## Material Replacement

A new Material can be dragged onto the Material thumbnail or link for any element to replace the Material(s) used on 
that element, if replacement is supported for the type of Actor or Component. Currently, Material replacement is 
supported for Actors with StaticMeshComponents, SkeletalMeshComponents, or DecalComponents.

Undo and redo of Material replacement is also fully supported.
