[EXCERPT:Transform]
The **Transform** section of the Details panel allows you to view and edit the transforms - **Location**, **Rotation**, and **Scale** - of selected Actor(s). Also, where applicable, this also contains the settings for Actor Mobility.

![Transform Properties](Transform_Properties.png)

Each **Transform** property has numeric entry fields for the X, Y, and Z axes. You may type precise values directly 
into these fields to adjust the selected Actors. When more than one Actor is selected and the values of the properties differ, 
the fields will display _Multiple Values_. In such cases, entering a number will cause that value to be entered for all selected Actors.

The **Rotation** fields have the unique ability to be used as sliders. Clicking and dragging on the field allows you to 
_roll_ the value, increasing or decreasing depending on the distance the mouse is moved.

The **Scale** fields can also be locked by clicking the ![](button_lock_scale.png) button. When locked, the ratio of 
the scale values to each other are maintained when any of the individual values are modified, allowing for uniform scaling.

The transform properties default to _relative_ transformation. This means the transform is relative to the component's parent. 
Each of the property labels are hyperlinks that can be clicked to toggle between _absolute_ and _relative_ transforms. When 
using _absolute_ transformations, the transform is relative to the world instead of the parent.
