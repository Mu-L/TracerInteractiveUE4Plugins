| Number | Name | Description |
| ------ | ---- | ------- |
| **1** | **Lock Icon** | Locks the **Details** panel so the Actor whose properties are being viewed in the panel does not change based on Actor selection. |
| **2** | **Friendly Name Box** | Displays the selected Actor's friendly name, which you can modify (grayed out when multiple Actors are selected). |
| **3** | **Search Filter Box** | Allows you to type text to filter which details are displayed. |
| **4** | **Property Matrix Icon** | Opens the Property Matrix, which allows you to view a matrix of property values belonging to multiple Actors at the same time, instead of as a combined list in the **Details** panel.  For more information about the Property Matrix, see [](Engine/UI/PropertyMatrix). |
| **5** | **Display Filter Icon** | Displays options to expand, collapse, or otherwise filter property categories. |
| **6** | **Properties Area** | Displays the Actor's properties so they can be viewed and/or modified. |
