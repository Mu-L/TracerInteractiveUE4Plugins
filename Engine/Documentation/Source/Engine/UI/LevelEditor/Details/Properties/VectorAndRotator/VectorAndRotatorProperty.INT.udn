Description:Vector or Rotator properties that contain multiple Float values.
Version: 4.9

 `Vectors` and `Rotators` are multi-value properties that display numeric inputs for each of their components 
laid out horizontally.

## Vector

 `Vectors` are properties that are used to store compound data that is ideally represented by three individual 
 `Float` values, such as a location in space or scale.

Each of the `Float` values (X, Y, and Z) in a `Vector` property is displayed as a numeric input box 
that can be modified using direct input from the keyboard or you can click the 
**Left Mouse Button** and drag horizontally to quickly modify each value.

## Rotator

 `Rotators` are properties that are specifically designed to store rotations using three `Float` values limited to 
the range `[0.0, 360.0]`, which represents the degrees of the rotation around each axis.

Each of the `Rotator` values (X, Y, and Z mapped to  Roll, Pitch, and Yaw respectively) is displayed
as a numerical spinner. Values can be manually set using direct input from the keyboard or you can click the 
**Left Mouse Button** and drag horizontally to quickly modify each value.
