[EXCERPT:overview]
Unreal Editor allows you to spawn a player anywhere and instantly preview your game from within the editor without waiting for files to save. There are two preview types available: **Play In Editor** (PIE) which is directly accessed via the **Play** button located on the Main Toolbar
and **Simulate In Editor** (SIE) which is accessed via the **Play** button's drop-down menu (or by pressing **Alt+S**). The in-editor preview system supports toggling between Play In Editor and Simulate In Editor sessions, so that you can quickly iterate on gameplay and asset tweaks
and see how your game changes as a result.
[/EXCERPT:overview]

When you launch a game preview session, the editor quickly creates a duplicate copy of your level. Changes can be saved back to the editor copy of the level using [Keep Simulation Changes](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\KeepSimulationChanges).
This duplication of the level keeps the editor's copy of the world safely immutable. 

Game previewing includes level streaming, and the **World Outliner** will update accordingly so that you can select and edit Actors that are streamed in as a result of gameplay. 
Additionally, any Actors you have selected when you begin testing your game with a _Play In Editor_ or _Simulate In Editor_ session will remain selected.  The reverse is also _true_, so any Actors selected
during in-editor testing will remain selected after you end the testing session. This means that the **Details** panel will show the properties for an Actor you have selected because you want to change its
appearance or behavior, even if you begin gameplay in a distant section of the level.

## Toolbar

You can begin a _Simulate In Editor_ or _Play In Editor_ session from either the **Level Editor** or the **Blueprint Editor**, using the appropriate Toolbar buttons or drop-down menus. 

From the **Level Editor**, if you click the **Play** button...

[INCLUDE:Shared\PlayWorld#RepeatLastPlay]

When clicking the **Play** drop-down button...

![](playin_dropdown.png)

The **Play Options** drop-down menu appears...

![](button_PlayMenu.png)

Here you can change your [Play In Editor mode](#Modes), set basic [networked Play In Editor](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\NetworkedPlayInEditor) options, or open the [full Play In Editor settings window](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\Settings). Clicking on **Simulate** begins _Simulate In Editor_ mode, which changes the testing section of the Toolbar.  While simulating, you can pause or stop gameplay, as well as swap to a _Play In Editor_ session with the **Possess** button.

## Play In Editor

Clicking on the **Play** button in the toolbar (**Alt + P** keybind by default) or, alternatively, selecting **Play From Here** in the **Viewport** context menu begins a _Play In Editor_ session.
_Play In Editor_ allows you to play the current level directly from the editor, so that you can test gameplay functionality, including player controls and level events triggered by players' actions.

### Modes
Launching a game preview with a different mode will change the default "Play" mode that is activated by the **Play** button.

#### Display Types

$ Viewport : Gameplay will be shown in the active Level Editor viewport.

	This is the only display type that allows toggling between _Play In Editor_ and _Simulate in Editor_ by using the Possess and Eject buttons. In the **Viewport** modes, you can also use the Pause and Stop buttons to interrupt gameplay.

	![](PIE_toolbar.png)

	By default, the preview window does not automatically get control of the mouse cursor.  You can click in the preview window to turn control of the mouse cursor over to the game. 

	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![](mouse_control_label.png)
	[/REGION]

	To regain control of the mouse cursor, press **Shift+F1**.  

	[REGION:fullwidth]
	![](mouse_regain_label.png)
	[/REGION]

	Small labels will appear in the preview window when you toggle mouse control.  To change the options for mouse control or how the mouse control label displays, use the [Play In Editor settings window](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\Settings#PlayInEditor).


$ New Window : Gameplay will be shown in a new window. To change the default new window size, use the [Play In Editor settings window](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\Settings#PlayInNewWindow).

	When playing a game preview in a new window, you cannot switch to a _Simulate In Editor_ session.  However, you can still pause and stop gameplay with the toolbar buttons that appear.

	![](pause_stop_only.png)

	By default, playing in a new window will give mouse control to the game automatically.  You can press **Shift+F1** to regain control of your mouse cursor.  

$ Standalone Game : Gameplay will be shown in a new window that runs in its own process. To change the default standalone window size, use the [Play In Editor settings window](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\Settings#PlayInStandaloneGame).

	Because this display type lets you play the game in its own process, you cannot pause or stop the game. You also cannot switch to _Simulate In Editor_.  As a result, the toolbar buttons do not change when playing a standalone game preview.

	By default, playing in a standalone window will give mouse control to the game automatically.  You can press **Shift+F1** to regain control of your mouse cursor.  

#### Start Locations

$ Camera Location : Gameplay begins at the current camera location.

$ Default Player Start : Gameplay begins at the Player Start location.

[REGION:note]
If your game uses a NavMesh for either player-controlled or AI-controlled movement, using Camera Location for your _Play In Editor_ starting location could cause you to spawn
in a location that breaks pathing.  In this case, starting a _Play In Editor_ session from the Default Player Start is recommended.
[/REGION]

### Play From Here

There is an additional _Play In Editor_ mode accessible by **right-clicking** in the **Viewport** and selecting **Play From Here**.  

![](play_from_here.png)

**Play From Here** begins gameplay at the location that you have clicked, and acts as if your **Display Type** is set to **Level Viewport**.  


### Switching to Simulate In Editor

While in a _Play In Editor_ session in a viewport, press **Shift+F1** to regain your mouse control. Then, click on **Eject** in the **Toolbar** to switch to a _Simulate In Editor_ session.
You will detach from the player controller, and begin a _Simulate In Editor_ session at your current location. 

[REGION:tip]
You can also press the **Eject** keyboard shortcut to switch to _Simulate In Editor_ from _Play In Editor_. (default: **F10**)
[/REGION:tip]

If you have set up more than one client for your _Play In Editor_ testing with [Networked Play In Editor](Engine/UI/LevelEditor\InEditorTesting\NetworkedPlayInEditor), only the first session (the one in the **Viewport**) will support 
switching to _Simulate In Editor_ mode. Even for single-player gameplay testing, _Play In Editor_ sessions where the game is in a new window or in a standalone game process do not support switching to _Simulate In Editor_. 


## Simulate In Editor

[INCLUDE:Shared/Glossary/S/#Glossary_Simulate_In_Editor]

### Switching to Play In Editor

While in a _Simulate In Editor_ session, you can click on **Possess** in the **Toolbar** to switch to a _Play In Editor_ session.
You will attach to the player controller, and begin a _Play In Editor_ session in the active level viewport. 

[REGION:tip]
You can also press the **Possess** keyboard shortcut to switch to _Play In Editor_ from _Simulate In Editor_. (default: **F10**)
[/REGION:tip]

If you began in-editor testing with a _Simulate In Editor_ session, and then used Possess to attach to the player controller, you will begin 
your _Play In Editor_ session at the default player start. This is equivalent to selecting **Play In > Viewport at > Default Player Start** from the **Play In** dropdown menu.
However, if you had previously swapped from a _Play In Editor_ session to a _Simulate In Editor_ session, without leaving in-editor testing mode, when you click **Possess**,
you will re-attach to the player controller and resume gameplay at the location in the level where you previously clicked on **Eject**.



## Testing Gameplay

### Blueprints

When you enter _Play In Editor_ or _Simulate In Editor_ mode, all your _Blueprints_ are compiled, although they are not saved. While playing or simulating, all _Blueprint_ graphs are read-only, so you cannot add additional nodes or connect wires differently.

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](simulating_readonly.png)
[/REGION]

However, you can change _Blueprint_ defaults while a preview session is active, and the changes will be applied to all instances of that _Blueprint_ in the level you are testing.  

### C++

For projects that contain C++ code, there is a **Compile** button on the **Level Editor Toolbar**.  This button recompiles and reloads game code on the fly.  If you change a property or a function in
a C++ file in your project, clicking the **Compile** button will recompile and reload your game module, so that your code changes are reflected in the editor.  In some cases, you can even compile
while using _Play In Editor_ or _Simulate In Editor_, and your code changes will update without you needing to stop gameplay or simulation.
