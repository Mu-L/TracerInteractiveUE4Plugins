Description:Tool for organizing Actors in the level into layers for quick selection and controlling visibility.
Version: 4.9
SkillLevel: Beginner


[TOC(start:2)]

[EXCERPT:Overview]
The **Layers** panel allows you to organize Actors in your Level. 

![](LayerInfra.jpg)

Layers provide the ability to quickly select as well as control visibility of groups of related Actors. 
You can use your layers to quickly un-clutter a scene leaving only the geometry and Actors that you are 
working with. For example, you might be working on a building that has multiple levels but is comprised 
of many modular parts. By assigning each floor to a layer, you can hide each of the floors you are not 
working on making the top view much more manageable.
[/EXCERPT:Overview]

An Actor can be in as many layers as you want. This might be useful if you have different sets of Actors 
that fall under overlapping layers. For instance, you could organize your layers by assigning everything 
within a particular _zone_ to one layer and have another layer comprised of all the doors in your level.

When creating large levels, the more extensively you use layers, the easier your job will be. And remember, 
it is always easier to start using layers from the beginning rather than trying to incorporate them after 
you are already deep into the creation of your level.

## Layer Creation

Layers are created in the **Layers** panel either as empty or using the current selection.

**To create an empty layer:**

1. **Right-click** in the **Layers** panel and choose _Create Empty Layer_.

	![Create Empty Layer menu option](layer_empty_menu.png)(quality:100)

1. The new layer is displayed in the list.

## Layer Naming

By default, new layers are given a name using a _Layer[number]_ naming scheme. The number is incremented 
for each new layer. It is best to make sure you name your layers with descriptive names, and never leave 
the default naming. For instance, a layer that contains small items scattered on the floor might be named 
_Ground Clutter_.  This not only makes it easy to quickly see what each layer contains, but also makes it
possible to filter the layers using the [search](#SearchingLayers) feature.

[REGION:tip]
Layer names can contain any alphanumeric characters and can also include spaces, hyphens, and underscores.
[/REGION]

**To rename a layer:**

1. **Right-click** on the layer and choose **Rename** from the context menu.

	![](RenameLayer.png)

1. Enter a name in the text box containing the current name.

1. The layer is displayed with the new name.

## Searching Layers

Layers can be filtered using the search box at the top of the **Layers** panel. Filtering occurs based on 
matches between the text entered in the search box and the names of the layers. As you type in the box, the 
list of layers is filtered in real-time; only displaying those layers whose names match the text.

[REGION:imagetable]
| ![](LayerNewName2.jpg)(w:452) | ![](LayersFilter.jpg)(w:460) |
| ------ | ------ |
| Unfiltered Layer List | Filtered Layer List |
[/REGION]

Press the 'X' button to clear the current search terms.

## Layer Contents

The contents of a layer can be viewed directly in the **Layers** panel. The layer contents view displays the 
name of the layer, a list of all Actors contained in the layer, and information about the layer's contents. 
To enter the layer contents view, press the **See Contents** button at the bottom of the 
**Layers** panel with the layer you want to view selected.

![Layer Contents view](layer_contents.png)

The name of the layer is displayed at the top along with a collection of buttons showing the various types 
and numbers of Actors contained within the layer. 

![Layer Contents View Title Bar](layer_title_bar.png)

The various buttons to the right of the layer's name show how many of each individual type of Actor are contained 
within the layer. For instance, the button in the bottom right of the Layers panel informs the user that 
there are 139 StaticMeshActors contained within the layer.

[REGION:tip]
These buttons can also be used to perform [type-specific selections](#Type-SpecificSelection).
[/REGION]

To return to the layer list, press the ![Back](button_back.png) button.
