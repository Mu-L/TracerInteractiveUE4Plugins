[EXCERPT:Intro]
The Mesh Paint tool is a brush-based system. Using the included settings, you can establish a brush designed for wide areas or fine details. It is important to keep in mind, however, that as the nature of the tool is to paint color onto actual vertices, you will often need to make settings adjustments based on the vertex density of your mesh.

This section describes the brush settings common between all of the tool's modes.  Note that for the options controlled by sliders, you can click and drag to change the value quickly, or you can click and type in a number if needed.

| **Setting** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
|**Radius**|The radius of the brush in Unreal units.  In addition, the brush has a depth-based falloff that is equal to half of this radius.|
|**Strength**|Sets the amount of paint to apply each time you click or move the mouse cursor while painting is enabled.  Also if _brush flow_ is enabled, a percentage (flow amount) of the brush's strength will be applied to the surface.|
|**Falloff**|Sets how the brush's strength falls off with distance.  A falloff value of 1.0 means that the center of the brush is 100% strong and fades linearly towards the radius of the brush.  A falloff value of 0.5 means that the brush is 100% strong half way towards the radius, then falls off linearly.  A falloff value of 0.0 means the brush is 100% strong over the entire radius.  Note that _depth-based falloff_ is always active, regardless of this setting.|
|**Enable brush flow**|This option configures the brush to apply paint every single render frame, even when you are not moving the cursor.  It yields results similar to an airbrush.|
|**Flow**|When _Enable brush flow_ is turned on, this sets the strength of the brush when paint is applied every render frame, as a percentage of the brush's strength.|
|**Ignore back-facing**|When enabled, triangles facing away from the camera are ignored and will not be affected by the paint brush.|
