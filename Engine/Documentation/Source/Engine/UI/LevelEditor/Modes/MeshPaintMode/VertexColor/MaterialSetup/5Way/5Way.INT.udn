Description:Guide to setting up materials for 5-way (1-ARGB) texture blending.
Version: 4.9
SkillLevel: Intermediate


To handle 5 textures in the blend weights setup, you need to create a material similar to this:

This works very similarly to the 3-way and 4-way setups. However, we now take one minus the alpha value to get a fifth color. Here is what is happening:

* Each of the color channels (ARGB) gets its own Linear Interpolation expression. 
* An additional Lerp is added, driven by 1 minus the alpha of the Vertex Color node. This will be the fifth color.
* Each texture plugs into the B input of its corresponding Lerp node.
* The Lerp corresponding to Texture 1 plugs into the material, and its alpha will be driven by the Alpha channel from the vertex color.
* The Lerp corresponding to Texture 2 plugs into the A input of the Lerp corresponding to Texture 1, and its alpha will be driven by the Red channel from the vertex color.
* The Lerp corresponding to Texture 3 plugs into the A input of the Lerp corresponding to Texture 2, and its alpha will be driven by the Green channel from the vertex color.
* The Lerp corresponding to Texture 4 plugs into the A input of the Lerp corresponding to Texture 3, and its alpha will be driven by the Blue channel from the vertex color.
* The Lerp corresponding to Texture 5 plugs into the A input of the Lerp corresponding to Texture 4, and its alpha will be driven by the 1-alpha from the vertex color.
* Texture one also wraps around and becomes the A plug for the 5th and final Lerp. This makes Texture 1 the default texture.


Once this is set up, the Blend Weights _Texture Count_ setting should be set to **5 (1-ARGB)**.

Here is an example of this material, first with the mesh viewed in RGB Mode, showing the vertex colors in place. Note that with this setup, _alpha_ (shown black) corresponds to Texture 1, _red_ corresponds to Texture 2, _green_ corresponds to Texture 3, and _blue_ corresponds to Texture 4. Incidentally, alpha is also used for Texture 5 and is also shown in black at the bottom.

And here is the final result:

Notice that where the vertex color in the first image is black (Texture 1) there is no change. This is because Texture 1 is also plugged into the A input of the 4th Lerp expression (see above), making it the default texture. Essentially, you start with Texture 1 and can paint Textures 2, 3, and 4 down as you see fit, or paint Texture 1 back down over them at any time.

[REGION:note]
	If you were going to be setting up such material over and over, this would be a great place to deploy a custom [Material Function](Engine/Rendering/Materials/Functions)!
