[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **Mesh Paint** tool allows you to paint vertex colors on Static Meshes interactively in the level viewport. You can paint multiple instances of a single mesh with unique color/alpha values, and use that data however you would like in your materials.  

Color data can be visualized directly, and you can easily edit multiple meshes at the same time.  Also, the tool has special features for painting "blend weights" that allow you to interpolate between multiple textures per-pixel.

Most of the vertex paint features are pretty easy to learn, so if you want to jump right in, here are the basic steps:

* [Set up a material which utilizes vertex color in some way, and apply it to a mesh.](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Modes/MeshPaintMode/VertexColor/MaterialSetup)
* [Activate the Mesh Paint Mode and select your mesh Actor.](#ActivatingMeshPaintMode)
* [Set your paint color and adjust other brush properties appropriately.](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Modes/MeshPaintMode/VertexColor/BrushSettings)
* [While holding down the Ctrl key, click and drag on your mesh to apply paint!](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Modes/MeshPaintMode/VertexColor/PaintingOnMeshes)


The following sections will describe the process in more detail, including the various brush settings and how materials are configured.

## Activating Mesh Paint Mode

In order to summon and use the Mesh Paint tool, you will need to enter **Mesh Paint Mode**.  Just click the paint brush button on the **Modes** panel.

This will show the **Mesh Paint** panel, which remains docked within the **Modes** panel of the editor frame.

While in this mode, you can still perform most common editor actions like camera movement and selection, but certain features are disabled.  Also, you will notice that your perspective viewport will be forced to _real-time mode_ which is a requirement of this system.

To exit Mesh Paint mode, you may simply choose another editor mode within the **Modes** panel.
