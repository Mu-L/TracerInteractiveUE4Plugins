## Searching the World

The World Outliner contains a text box that is used to search and quickly filter the list of Actors in the scene. All Actors with even a partial match to the search term will be displayed. You can use multiple words in the search box now and only Actors that match all the terms will be displayed.

![Scene Outliner Search](outliner_search.png)

Actors matching specific terms can be excluded by using "-" before a term. 

![Scene Outliner Search - Exclude Term](outliner_search_exclude.png)

A term can be forced to match exactly, as opposed to a partial match, by adding a "+" before a term. 

![Scene Outliner Search - Force Term](outliner_search_force.png)

Double quotes can be placed around the search term to force an exact match of the full term in the Actor's long name.

![Scene Outliner Search - Verbatim Match](outliner_search_verbatim.png)

When the **Info** columns are shown, the data within them can be searched as well. This is really useful if you want to display Actors in a certain level; just turn on the Level display and type "+[LevelName]" in the search box.
