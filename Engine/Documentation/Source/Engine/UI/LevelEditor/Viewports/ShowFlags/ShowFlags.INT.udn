[TOC(start:2 end:2)]




The Show Flags are found under the Viewport **Show** menu. They are a means by which you can show and hide many of the items that are viewed within the viewport. For example, you can hide all particles, all landscape objects, or something a bit more advanced like turning off all of the sprite icons.

## Visualize

|Visualize||
|---|---|
|[REGION:tablesection]Name[/REGION]|[REGION:tablesection]Description[/REGION]|
|**Adaptive Depth of Field**|Applies a color coding filter to the view such that objects that are blurred by Depth of Field are tinted green and only the area in focus receives its normal color.|
|**Bloom**| Shows a visualization window that expresses the scene histogram, as well as how settings are affecting bloom. |
|**Depth of Field Layers**|Applies a color coding filter to the view such that objects blurred by near DOF are green, objects blurred by far DOF are blue. Objects in focus appear black. |
|**Distance Field Ambient Occlusion**| Shows a visualization of ambient occlusion generated based on mesh distance fields. |
|**Distance Field Global Illumination**| Shows a visualization of global illumination generated based on mesh distance fields. |
|**HDR**|Shows a visualization window that expresses the scene histogram, as well as how exposure settings are affecting brightness. |

| [Out of Bounds Pixels](Engine/Performance/Visualizers/OutOfBoundsPixels) | If a pixel of an object exists outside that object's bounding volume, it can lead to flickering or the object disapearing when the bounding volume (but not the mesh) is off camera. This visualizer colorizes those pixels in blue, yellow, and white. |
|**Precomputed Visibility Cells**|Shows a visualization of precomputed visibility cells when used with Precomputed Visibility Volumes. |

[REGION:note]
Billboard sprites are generally in-editor icons used for placement of various object types. In this case, they do not refer to sprite particles.
