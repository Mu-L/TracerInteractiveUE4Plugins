The **Transform Tools** serve as your primary means of manipulating objects within the viewport. There are 3 tools available:

* Move Tool
* Rotate Tool
* Scale Tool

Each one of these tools also has settings to handle snapping. For more information on using the Transform Tools and the various snapping methods available, please see the [Actor Placement](Engine/Actors/Placement) page.
