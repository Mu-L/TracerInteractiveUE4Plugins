Description: How to setup and use Mesh Preview Scene Profiles in Unreal Engine 4.
Version: 4.13

Across the various editor windows for your Static and Skeletal Meshes, you can now setup your own preview scenes to be used when inspecting your assets. This enables you to quickly assess what your assets would look like in multiple environments and lighting scenarios without having to set up these scenes within your level.

The **Preview Scene Settings** panel enables you to adjust the following in your preview scene:

* Directional Lights: Color, Intensity, and Rotation
* Sky Lights: HDRI Environment Map, Intensity, and Rotation
* Post Process Volumes: All Settings

## Using Scene Profiles

The **Preview Scene Settings** enable you to set up any number of environments and lighting scenarios to emulate your game levels. These scenes can be saved as any number of separate 
profiles that can be shared between the various editor windows. 


### Adding Profiles

1. When you open your Static or Skeletal Mesh from the Content Browser, locate the panel on the right for **Preview Scene Settings** in the editor window.

	| --- | --- |
	|Static Mesh Editor| Skeletal Mesh Editor |
	| _Click for Full Image_ | _Click for Full Image_ |
	[/REGION]

2. Adjust the various settings until you have something that emulates the environment lighting and Post Processing settings you would like to use.

### Rotating the Environment

In this section, you will adjust the environment rotation which will rotate the skybox and the Directional Light around the mesh. This setting can be used to simply rotate the environment
around the mesh manually or to set a speed for the environment to rotate continually.


1. Enable environment rotation by placing a checkbox next to **Rotate Sky and Directional Lighting**.

	[![](RotatingEnvironment.png)(w:350)](RotatingEnvironment.png) 
	[/REGION]

2. Next, set a value for **Rotation Speed** for the environment to start rotating.
