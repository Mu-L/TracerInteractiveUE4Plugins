[EXCERPT:Intro]
The **Project Settings** editor provides access to configuration options that specify information about 
your project, as well as define how the engine behaves when running the project. Some of these options 
are specific to the game itself, while others are more general with regards to the engine or platforms 
you are running on.

[REGION:note]
All of the settings here are stored in the default engine configuration file (`Engine.ini`) for your 
project, and can be manually edited there if desired. The **Project Settings** editor simply provides an 
intuitive user interface for editing these.
