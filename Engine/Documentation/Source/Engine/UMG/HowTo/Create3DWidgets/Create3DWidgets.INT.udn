This is an experimental feature that is currently undergoing development. Some aspects may not work as expected or may change in future revisions.

Most UI elements can be rendered in 2D screen space, however there may be instances where you want something to appear inside your game world instead overlaid on screen. 
This could be a computer terminal or key pad that a player must interact with, it could be the display of an enemy or player health bar, or even a menu that you want to display in the game world in 3D space. 

This How-to will walk you through the process of creating a 3D Widget.
