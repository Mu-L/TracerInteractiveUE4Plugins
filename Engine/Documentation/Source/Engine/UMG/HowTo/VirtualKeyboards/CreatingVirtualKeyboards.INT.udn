If you are looking to create a 3D keypad or virtual keyboard that allows a player to enter specified characters, you can do so with a combination of the [Widget Interaction](Engine\UMG\UserGuide\WidgetInteraction) component and [Widget](Engine/Components/Widget) components. 
The Widget Interaction component will help facilitate which "buttons" are clicked on and processes sending the characters through to a Widget component in an Actor that will handle the display.

In this how-to, we create a keypad that can be interacted with in and provides entries to a text box.

_At the end of this guide, you will have a keypad and display that appears inside the 3D game world and can be interacted with._

One important aspect in setting this up will be to determine the Widgets that are (or are not) focusable. If the Text Box that displays the characters the player enters is set to focusable and the buttons that the player clicks on to send characters through is also focusable, the Text Box would lose player focus when a button (or any other widget) is clicked on and not receive the commands issued. 

The first step, however, is to set up our character with the Widget Interaction component and create the assets to display our UI.
