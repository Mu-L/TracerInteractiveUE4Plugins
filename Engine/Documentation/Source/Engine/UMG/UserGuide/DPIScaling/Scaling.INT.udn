**UMG** supports automatic scaling for resolution-independent UI. There are default DPI scaling rules applied to every project which configured as you see fit from inside the **Project Settings** menu under the **User Interface** section.

For the **DPI Scale Rule**, you can set this to one of four options: 

* **Shortest Side** - Which evaluates the scale curve based on the shortest side of the viewport (Most Common Setting). 
* **Longest Side** - Evaluates the scale curve based on the longest side of the viewport. 
* **Horizontal** - This evaluates the scale curve based on the X axis of the viewport. 
* **Vertical** - This option evaluates the scale curve based on the Y axis of the viewport. 

You can add points to the curve by **Right-clicking** and selecting the **Add Key** option. When clicking on a Key on the curve, you can set the resolution and its corresponding scale value via the input boxes. Also for the curve, you can supply an external **Float Curve** or create a Float Curve based on the currently applied settings by expanding the **DPI Curve** option.
