## Steps

Follow the steps below to see how to assign your own Fonts to be used with the UMG UI Designer.

[REGION:note]
For this how-to guide, we are using the **Blank Template** project, using no **Starter Content**, with default **Target Hardware** and **Project Settings**. 
[/REGION]

1. To create a new [Widget Blueprint](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/WidgetBlueprints), from the Content Browser click on the **Add New** button, then hover over **User Interface**, and then click on **Widget Blueprint** selection. This will create
a new Widget Blueprint. Make sure to give it a name that you can easily locate later.

1. Go back to the Content Browser where you saved your Widget Blueprint and double-click on it to open it up. In the Widget Blueprint's Palette, select a **Text** widget and drag it onto the 
graph. Then grab the corner and scale it to a larger size.

		[PARAMLITERAL:height]
		360

		[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]

		[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[/OBJECT]

1. Now that you've created your Text Widget, you can click on it and access the **Details** panel, under **Appearance**, you'll see a **Font** option where you can change the font type, it's styling (regular, bold, itallic, etc.), and its size.

1. By default, the Engine uses the **Roboto** font, however, if you click the dropdown menu, any Composite Font assets created can be selected and used instead.

	[REGION:note]
	You can also choose to create a Composite Font from this menu and specify where the new asset should be saved (it will be blank by default, requiring you to fill it out).
	[/REGION]
		
1. Once you select your Composite Font, the second dropdown menu will allow you to select a font to use from the **Default Font Family**.

	You can also specify the size of the font in the input box.

[REGION:note]
Currently, UMG only supports **Runtime** cached font assets. Also, if you have assigned fonts using the old method, none of your existing file-based font settings will be lost, however going forward, you will need to create
a Composite Font asset in order to use custom fonts with UMG.

## End Result
 
 Now that you've successfully used your fonts in UMG, you can head over to learn how to style your **Fonts** by [setting colors, Materials, and outline properties](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/Fonts/Materials) (as well as by using shadows).
