When you start to import your Fonts, you can choose between several methods and choose the method that best fits your workflow. The available methods you can use to import are:

* Using the Content Browser's Import button
* Drag-and-drop method into the Content Browser
* Using the Font Editor

You also have the choice between **TrueType Font** (TTF) and **OpenType Font** (OTF) files when importing your fonts. Choose the import method and font type that best fits your needs.


[REGION:note]
For this how-to guide, we are using the **Blank Template** project, using no **Starter Content**, with default **Target Hardware** and **Project Settings**.

## Using the Content Browser

You can use the Content Browser's **Import** button to select your TTF or OTF font file.

1.	In the Content Browser, click the **Import** button.

## Using the Font Editor

You can import and create Font Face assets directly from the [Default Font Family](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/Fonts/Overview#defaultfontfamily) list in the **Font Editor** removing the need to 
import a font asset first then assign it. 

1.	Open an existing **Font** asset or create a new one using the **Add New** button in the Content Browser.
