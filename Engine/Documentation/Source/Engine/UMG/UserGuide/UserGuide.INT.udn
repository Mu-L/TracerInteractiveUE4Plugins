**Unreal Motion Graphics UI Designer (UMG)**  is a visual UI authoring tool which can be used to create UI elements such as in-game HUDs, menus or other interface related graphics you wish to present to your users. At the core of UMG are Widgets, which are a series of pre-made functions that can be used to construct your interface (things like buttons, checkboxes, sliders, progress bars, etc.). These Widgets are edited in a specialized Widget Blueprint, which uses two tabs for construction: the Designer tab allows for the visual layout of the interface and basic functions while the Graph tab provides the functionality behind the Widgets used.
