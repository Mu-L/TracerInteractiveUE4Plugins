##Description

[EXCERPT:desc]
Widgets that are wrapped with an Invalidation Box allows the child widget geometry to be cached to speed up Slate rendering. Any widgets that are cached by an Invalidation Box are not Prepassed, Ticked or Painted. 
[/EXCERPT:desc]

In general, if you are looking to optimize your project, wrapping certain widgets with Invalidation Boxes may boost your performance (particularly for mobile projects or complicated UI displays). For widgets that do not change constantly, they can be placed inside an Invalidation Box and cached instead of considered during paint, tick or prepass. 

If the widget changes however, it will become invalid and you will need to manually invalidate the cache which will throw it away essentially and force it to redraw on the next paint pass. Anything that changes the visual appearance of the widget requires it to be invalidated. The only exception to this is changes to appearance that are not stored in the vertex buffer for those widget (for example Materials, as changing a Material Parameter does not require invalidating the widget). 


##Details

In the **Details** panel for a placed **Invalidation Box**, there are a couple of specific options that can be set that pertain to the Widget: 

![](InvalidationBox.png)

| Option | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| **Cache Relative Transforms** | Caches the locations for child draw elements relative to the invalidation box which adds extra overhead to drawing them every frame. However, in cases where the position of the invalidation boxes changes every frame, this can be a big savings. |
| **Is Volatile** | If true, prevents the widget or its child's geometry or layout information from being cached. If this widget changes every frame, but you want it to still be in an invalidation panel, you should make it as volatile instead of invalidating it every frame, which would prevent the invalidation panel from actually ever caching anything.  |

Regarding the **IsVolatile** check box, any widget can be set to be Volatile. Volatile widgets act like normal Slate widgets pre-invalidation. They're redrawn every frame, including all their children. When combined with the invalidation panel, it allows you to only need to care about redrawing only the most dynamic bits of the UI, as invalidating a whole panel could be far more costly.

##Functions

When using an **Invalidation Box**, it's up to the user to call [`Invalidate`](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/API/Runtime/SlateCore/Widgets/SWidget/Invalidate/index.html) through C++ or the **Invalidate Layout And Volatility** node (pictured below) on a child widget to force invalidation.

[REGION:note]
Currently some core widgets do this automatically when certain properties are changed, however more will do it over time.

## Debugging

You can debug your Invalidation Boxes using the Widget Reflector (**CTRL+Shift+W**) and clicking the **Invalidation Debugging** toggle.

With the Widget Reflector up and Invalidation Debugging on, you will see the following: 

* White/Red Flash - This is the widget response for invalidation. 
* Green Boarder - This is for Invalidation Panels (Cached This Frame). 
* Red Boarder - This is for Invalidation Panels (Cache Invalidated This Frame). 
* Dashed Yellow Border - These identify volatile widgets.

Above we have an image that is marked as Volatile inside of a Border which is wrapped with an Invalidation Box. Since the image is marked as Volatile, it can be updated dynamically during gameplay while the Border (or any other art assets that we wanted to appear around the image that do not change) is cached.
