Once you've installed the Datasmith Exporter plugin for 3ds Max, you'll have a new *.UDATASMITH* file type available to you when you export a scene from 3ds Max.

Follow the steps below in 3ds Max to export your scene using this new file type.

1.  From the 3ds Max **File** menu, or the **MAX** menu at the far left of the main menu bar, choose **Export**.

	1.  **Save in:** Choose a location for the new Datasmith file.
	1.  **File Name:** Give your file a name.
	1.  **Save as type:** Select **Unreal Datasmith (*.UDATASMITH)**

1.  Click **Save**.
1.  In the **Datasmith Export Options** window, choose **Visible objects** to include everything in your scene in the Datasmith file, or **Selection** to include only the objects you currently have selected.

1.  Click **OK**.

After the export is completed, the exporter shows a report of any issues it found with your content â€” typically, these are notifications of things that the exporter couldn't translate perfectly, or that may not show up in the Unreal Engine in exactly the way they do in 3ds Max.

### End Result

You should now be ready to try importing your new *.udatasmith* file into the Unreal Editor. See [Importing Datasmith Content into Unreal Engine 4](Enterprise/Datasmith/HowTo/ImportingContent).

[REGION:note]
Along with your new *.udatasmith* file, you'll see a folder that has the same name but with the suffix *_Assets*. If you move your *.udatasmith* file to a new location, make sure that you also move this folder to the same location.
