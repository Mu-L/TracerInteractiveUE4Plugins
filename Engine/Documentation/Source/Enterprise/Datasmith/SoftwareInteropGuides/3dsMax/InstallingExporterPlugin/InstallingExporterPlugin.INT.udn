## Installing the Datasmith Exporter for 3ds Max

Follow the steps below to install the Datasmith Exporter plugin for any supported version of 3ds Max that you have installed on your computer.

1.  Close any instances of Autodesk 3ds Max that are running on your machine. If any instances are still running, the installation will fail.
1.  If you have already installed an older version of the Datasmith Exporter plugin, we recommend uninstalling it first. For details, see [Removing the Datasmith Exporter for 3ds Max](#removingthedatasmithexporterfor3dsmax) below.
1.  Download the Exporter plugin from the [Datasmith Export Plugins download](https://www.unrealengine.com/studio/downloads) page.
1.  When the download has completed, run the installer, accept the license agreement, and follow the prompts.
