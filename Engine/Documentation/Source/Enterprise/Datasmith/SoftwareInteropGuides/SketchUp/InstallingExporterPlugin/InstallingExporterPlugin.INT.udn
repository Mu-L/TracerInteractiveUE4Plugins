Before you can get started working with your SketchUp content in the Unreal Engine, you need to install the Unreal Datasmith Exporter plugin for SketchUp.

To see what versions of SketchUp Pro the exporter plugin currently supports, see [Datasmith Supported Software and File Types](Enterprise/Datasmith/SupportedSoftwareAndFileTypes).

## Installing the Datasmith Exporter for SketchUp

Follow the steps below to install the Datasmith Exporter plugin for any supported version of SketchUp that you have installed on your computer.

1.  Close any instances of SketchUp that are running on your machine. If any instances are still running, the installation will fail.
1.  If you have already installed an older version of the Datasmith Exporter plugin, we recommend uninstalling it first. For details, see [Removing the Datasmith Exporter for SketchUp](#removingthedatasmithexporterforsketchup) below.
1.  Download the Exporter plugin from the [Datasmith Export Plugins download](https://www.unrealengine.com/studio/downloads) page, or from the Epic Games Launcher.
1.  When the download has completed, run the installer, accept the license agreement, and follow the prompts.
