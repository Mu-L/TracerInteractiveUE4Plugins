[Apsalar](http://www.apsalar.com) started as a free analytics service that can perform Facebook advertisement attribution. It recently switched to a fee based model. It's a popular service, 
since you can measure the return on investment for Facebook Mobile Ads, which only a small number of analytics providers can do. To use their service, you must register at their site, get an
 application key and password that uniquely identifies your app, and download the libraries which get compiled into the Apsalar plugin. See the plugin's corresponding `<PlatformAndName>.Build.cs`
 file to see where the libraries and headers are expected to be placed. 
 
## Configuration

Once you have done the prerequisites and have successfully built the plugin for the target platform, you can configure the plugin for your game. As of 4.5, there are five configuration 
options. The `ApiKey` and `ApiSecret` are used to uniquely identify your application. The `SendInterval` setting controls how often data is sent to the Apsalar servers. `MaxBufferSize` is the
 size of the buffer it keeps before flushing to the service. `ManuallyReportRevenue` controls whether Apsalar listens to in-app purchase receipts or not. If set to false, Apsalar will 
 automatically report revenue for your application. The only required properties are the `ApiKey` and `ApiSecret`. You can leave the others out of your configuration and Apsalar's defaults 
 will be used. The snippet below shows a theoretical configuration for Apsalar. As with all analytics providers, the configuration data goes in your `DefaultEngine.ini` file.

	[Analytics]
	ApiKey=MyAppsAnalytics
	ApiSecret=Ga35tYi
	SendInterval=60
	MaxBufferSize=32767
	ManuallyReportRevenue=true
