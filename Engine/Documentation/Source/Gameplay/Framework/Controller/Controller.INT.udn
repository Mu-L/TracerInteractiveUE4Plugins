[INCLUDE:Shared/Glossary/C/#Glossary_Controller_Class]

Controllers receive notifications for many of the events occurring for the Pawn they are controlling.  This gives the Controller the opportunity to implement the behavior
in response to this event, intercepting the event and superseding the Pawn's default behavior. 	It is possible to make the Controller tick before a given Pawn, which  minimizes latency 
between input processing and Pawn movement.

By default, there is a one-to-one relationship between Controllers and Pawns; meaning, each Controller controls only one Pawn at any given time. This is acceptable for
most types of games, but may need to be adjusted as certain types of games - real-time strategy comes to mind - may require the ability to control multiple entities at once.
