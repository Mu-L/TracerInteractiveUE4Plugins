## Basic Gameplay Concepts

These pages will introduce you to key Unreal terms. To add new types of gameplay objects, you will generally create a new class. 
A class is a template, or collection of rules, for your new object, so that you can create as many copies as you need, each containing 
properties and behavior that you set in the template.

class page for more information.
