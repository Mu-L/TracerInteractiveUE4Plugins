When developing your game, there may be instances when you want to allow the player to perform some form of **Input** on an Actor in your level. For example, perhaps you have a treasure chest that you want the player to be able to open when they approach it, or a light you want them to be able to turn on/off, or some other form of interactable object you want to affect in some way when the player presses a button. 

Setting up Input for an Actor gives you a level of control over how and when the Actor responds to player input. For more information, see the link provided in the **Setup** section below.
