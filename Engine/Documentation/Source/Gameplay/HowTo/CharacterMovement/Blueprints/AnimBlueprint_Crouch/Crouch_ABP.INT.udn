In this section, we continue working on the **Animation Blueprint** and the **State Machine** focusing on the **Crouch** states. 

 
1.	In the **MyAnimationBlueprint** on your State Machine graph, drag in the **Crouch_BS** Blend Space from the **Asset Browser**. 

1.	Create a **Transition** from **Crouch_BS** to **Walk_BS** and from **Walk_BS** back to **Crouch_BS**.

1.	**Double-click** on the **Crouch_BS** and drag in the **Direction** and **Speed** variables and connect them to the Blend Space.

1.	Return to the State Machine graph and open the **Transition Rule** for **Walk_BS** to **Crouch_BS** and recreate the graph below. 

	![](AnimBP_Crouch4.png)

	Here we are allowing the player to enter crouched walking when crouched is pressed and their speed is greater than 0. 

1.	Return to the State Machine graph and open the **Transition Rule** for **Crouch_BS** to **Walk_BS** and recreate the graph below. 

	![](AnimBP_Crouch5.png)

	Above we are returning the player to a walking state when they are no longer crouched and their speed is greater than 0. 

1.	Return to the State Machine graph, then in the **Asset Browser** drag into the graph the **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip** animation. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle1.png)

1.	Create a **Transition** from **Crouch_BS** to **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip** and from **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip** back to **Crouch_BS**. 

1.	Also create a **Transition** from **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip** to **Idle_Rifle_Hip**, and from **Idle_Rifle_Hip** back to **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip**.

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle2.png)

	Here we are providing transitions for our crouch walk to enter crouch idle (and from crouch idle to crouch walk). We are also setting a transition from our crouch idle to a standing idle (and from standing idle to a crouch idle). 

	If needed, you can move the nodes around on your graph to get a better picture of the transitions. 

1.	Open the **Transition Rule** for **Idle_Rifle_Hip** to **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip**. 

1.	For this **Transition**, we are only requesting that **IsCrouch** be _True_. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle3.png)

1.	Return to the State Machine graph, then open the **Transition Rule** for **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip** to **Idle_Rifle_Hip**. 

1.	For this **Transition**, we are only requesting that **IsCrouch** be _False_. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle4.png)

1.	Return to the State Machine graph, then open the **Transition Rule** for the **Crouch_BS** to **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip**. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle5.png)

1.	In the **Transition Rule**, recreate the graph below. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle6.png)

	If the player is crouched and their speed is 0, then they will enter the crouch idle animation. 

1.	Return to the State Machine graph, then open the **Transition Rule** for the **Crouch_Idle_Rifle_Hip** to **Crouch_BS**. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle7.png)

1.	In the **Transition Rule**, recreate the graph below. 

	![](AnimBP_CrouchIdle8.png)

	If the player pressed crouch and their speed is greater than 0, they will enter the crouch walk Blend Space. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save** the Animation Blueprint.
