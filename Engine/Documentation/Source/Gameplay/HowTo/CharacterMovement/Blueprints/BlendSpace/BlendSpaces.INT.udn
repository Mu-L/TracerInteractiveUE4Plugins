The next thing we will do to create movement for our character is to create **Blend Spaces** for each of our movement states (Walking, Jogging, and Crouch Walking). Blend Spaces are special assets that allow for blending of animations based on the values of two inputs. In our case, we will blend between forwards/backwards and left/right movement based on the character's movement Speed or Direction.

For more information on Blend Spaces, refer to the [](Engine/Animation/Blendspaces) documentation.

The steps below will show you how to set up the movement Blend Spaces: 

1.	**Right-click** inside the **Content Browser**, select **Animation**, then select **Blend Space** to create a new asset.

1.	In the **Pick Skeleton** window, select your Skeleton (**UE4_Mannequin_Skeleton**), then name the asset **Walk_BS**. 

1.	Open the **Walk_BS** Blend Space, then under **Parameters**, set the **X Axis Label** to **Direction** and **Y Axis Label** to **Speed**. 

1.	Set the **X Axis Range** to **-180** to **180** and the **X Axis Divisions** to **4**. 

1.	Set the **Y Axis Label** to **Speed**, the **Y Axis Range** to **0** to **200** and **Y Axis Divisions** to **4**. 

1.	Once you have set the values for both the X and Y Axis, click the **Apply Parameter Changes** button.

	Your set up should look like above. After clicking apply, the grid space to the left of the **Parameter** window will update to use our input values that will be used to determine the blending between our movement animations. 

1.	In the **Asset Browser** window, search for **rifle ironsights** animations (we will be using these motions for our character). 

	![](Blendspace_3.png)

1.	Locate the **Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation, then drag-and-drop it to the bottom-center position on the grid space. 

	![](Blendspace_4.png)(w:800)

	This will create a point of reference on the grid space. 

1.	Drag the **Walk_Lt_Rifle_Ironsights** and **Walk_Rt_Rifle_Ironsights** animations into the grid to the left/right of the walk forward point. 

	![](Blendspace_5.png)

	Above **Walk_Lt_Rifle_Ironsights** (L), **Walk_Fwd_Rifle_Ironsights** (F) and **Walk_Rt_Rifle_Ironsights** (R) are shown on the grid. 

1.	Drag in the **Walk_Bwd_Rifle_Ironsights** animation and place it on the bottom left end and bottom right end points. 

1.	Along the top of the grid, repeat the same layout as the bottom from left-to-right (Bwd, Lt, Fwd, Rt, Bwd). 

	![](Blendspace_6.png)

	Moving your mouse inside the grid now, you should start to see the character walking and blending between directions. 

1.	In the **Anim Asset Details**, under **Sample Interpolation**, set the **Target Weight Interpolation Speed Per Sec** to **2.0**. 

	![](Blendspace_7.png)

	This will smooth out the blending when shifting between directions. 

1.	**Save** then close the **Walk_BS** Blend Space window. 

1.	In the **Content Browser**, **Right-click** on the **Walk_BS** asset and select **Duplicate**. 

1.	Rename the copy to **Jog_BS** and open it up. 

1.	Under **Parameters**, change the **Y Axis Range** max value from 200 to **375** then click apply. 

	![](Blendspace_8.png)

	The 375 value refers to the speed of our Jog that we set inside the MyCharacter Blueprint. 

1.	The grid will update to use the max speed value, however the points on the grid remain in their previous position. 

	![](Blendspace_9.png)

1.	**Left-click** on and drag each of the points up to the top of the grid at their respective locations. 

1.	In the **Asset Window** search for **Jog** animations.

1.	Replace the walk animations on the grid with jog animations by dragging a Jog animation onto a Walk point on the grid. 

	![](Blendspace_10.png)(w:640)

	Along the bottom and top of the grid we are using the Jog (Bwd, Lt, Fwd, Rt, Bwd) Rifle animations. 

1.	**Save** then close the **Jog_BS** Blend Space window. 

1.	Duplicate the **Jog_BS** and rename it to **Crouch_BS** then open it up. 

1.	Under **Parameters**, change the **Y Axis Range** max value from 375 to **160** then click apply. 

1.	In the **Asset Browser**, search for **rifle ironsights**. 

1.	Replace each of the points on the grid with their respective **Crouch_Walk** animations. 

	![](Blendspace_11.png)(w:640)

1.	**Save** then close the **Crouch_BS** Blend Space window.
