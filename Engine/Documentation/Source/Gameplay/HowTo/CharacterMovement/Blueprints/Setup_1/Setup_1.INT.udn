To get started, we will create some assets that will be used by our character. First we will create an **Animation Blueprint** (we will populate it later in this series) which will be used to drive the animations of the character, then we will create our **Character Blueprint** which will hold the logic behind our character's actions and how it responds to input. 

[REGION:note]
For this project, we are using the **Animation Starter Pack** which is available for free in the **Marketplace**. Once you have downloaded the Animation Starter Pack, you can add the pack to an existing project via the **Add to project** button in the Launcher then specifying the project you want to add the assets to. 

For this project, we are using the **Blank** Project Template in order to start with a fresh project.

	The **Spring Arm** component will be used with a **Camera** to create a Third Person Perspective.

1.	Click the **Add Component** button, then add a **Camera** Component. 

1.	In the **Components Window**, click on and drag the **Camera** onto the **Spring Arm** to make it a child of the Spring Arm Component.

1.	In the **Component Window**, click on the **Character Movement** Component.

1.	In the **Details** panel, search for **Rotation** and under **Character Movement**, check the boxes shown below.

1.	Next search for **Walk Speed**, then set the **Max Walk Speed** to **200** and **Max Walk Speed Crouched** to **160**. 

	![](Characters_7.png)

	You can change these values to whatever you would like, but this should serve as a good starting point. 

1.	In the **My Blueprint** window, click the **Create Variable** button and create a **Bool** called **JogPressed**. 

1.	Create four more **Bool** variables: **CrouchPressed**, **PronePressed**, **JumpPressed**, and **DisableMovement**.
