This page will show you how to set up and use different forms of **Replicated Functions**. 

There are 3 primary types of replicated functions: **Multicast**, **Run on Server**, and **Run on owning Client**. Multicast functions should be called on the server, where they are executed, and then forwarded automatically to clients. Server functions are called by a client and then only executed on the server. Client functions are called by the server and then only execute on the owning client.

## Multicast

 _For this example, we are using the **Blueprint Third Person Template with Starter Content**._

 The steps below illustrate how to set a **Multicast** Replicated Function. 
 
1.	Increase the number of players by clicking the down arrow next to **Play** and changing **Number of Players** to **4**.

	[REGION:tip]
	You can change the size of the windows that are generated for multiplayer inside the **Advanced Settings** option. 
	[/REGION]

1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints**, open the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add a **Space Bar** Key Event and a **Spawn Actor from Class** node. 

1.	**Right-click** and add a **Get Actor Transform** node and connect as shown below with **Class** set to **Blueprint_Effect_Fire**. 

	![](HowTo3.png)

	When pressed, this will spawn a fire effect at the player character's position. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save**, then close the Blueprint and then click the **Play** button to play in the editor. 

1.	In game, locate the window that is the Server and press **Space Bar** to jump. 
		
	![](HowTo4.png)
	
	You will see that only the server window spawns the fire effect and the other players do not see the effect spawned. 
	When attempting to jump with the other players, they too only spawn the fire effect locally and each of the other players are not aware that an effect has been spawned. 
	Additionally, we have not attached the fire effect to the character so it only spawns at the characters location at the time **Space Bar** is pressed. 

	[REGION:tip]
	You can press **Shift + F1** to gain Mouse Control and jump between game windows during Multiplayer testing. 
	[/REGION]

1.	In the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint, **Right-click** on **Pressed** for the **Space Bar** node and break the connection. 

1.	**Right-click** and search for then add a **Custom Event** and call the event **MulticastSpawn**. 

1.	Click on the custom event, then in the **Details** panel set the **Replicates** drop-down menu to **Multicast** and connect as shown. 

	![](HowTo5.png)

	The last few steps should result in the above where we have set our custom event to use **Multicast** Replication. 

1.	Off the **Space Bar** Key Event, search for and add the call function **MulticastSpawn**. 

	![](HowTo6.png)

	[REGION:note]
	If you do not see the custom event you created, click the **Compile** button and search for it again. 
	[/REGION]

1.	**Compile** and **Save**, then close the Blueprint and then click the **Play** button to play in the editor. 

1.	In game, locate the window that is the Server and press **Space Bar** to jump. 

	![](HowTo7.png)

	You should now see that when you press jump with the player that is the server, that the fire effect is spawned not only on the server but on all clients as well. Attempting to jump with other players still only spawns the effect locally, as we have not told the server that the client has spawned the effect. The next section, Run on Server will show you how to set that up. 


## Run On Server

 _For this example, we are continuing from the **Multicast Replication** example above._

 The steps below show how to set up a **Run on Server** replicated function. 
 
1.	In the **Content Browser** under **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints**, open the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint. 

1.	Select the **MulticastSpawn** Custom Event and change the **Replicates** drop down option to **Run on Server**. 

	![](HowTo8.png)
	
	We also updated the name of the **Graph Node** to **Run On Server** for consistency. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save**, then close the Blueprint and then click the **Play** button to play in the editor. 

1.	In game, locate any game window other than Server and press **Space Bar** to jump. 

	![](HowTo9.png)

	Notice that the fire effect is only spawned only on the server, regardless of which player jumped, and no other players can see it but the server. While we have told this script that it should execute on the server, which it did, we need to make sure that the effect itself is set to replicate so that it gets passed to all clients as well as the server. 

1.	Inside the **Content/StarterContent/Blueprints** folder, open the **Blueprint_Effect_Fire** Blueprint. 

1.	With **Class Defaults** selected from the Main Toolbar, in the **Details** panel, check the **Replicates** checkbox. 

	![](HowTo10.png)

1.	**Compile** and **Save**, then close the Blueprint and then click the **Play** button to play in the editor. 

1.	In game, locate any game window other than Server and press **Space Bar** to jump. 

	![](HowTo11.png)

	We have effectively sent a message to the server to run a portion of script on the server to spawn an Actor, since that Actor is set to replicate, we can see it on all clients as well.
	

## Run On Owning Client

_For this example, we are continuing from the **Multicast Replication** example above._

What we will do in this example is create a variable that only gets updated on a specific client when a server event occurs. 

 The steps below show how to set up a **Run on owning Client** replicated function. 
 
1.	Inside the **Content/ThirdPersonBP/Blueprints** folder, open the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint. 

1.	In the **MyBlueprint** window, create a new variable and name it **Inventory** then click **Compile**. 

	![](Inventory.png)

1.	In the **Details** panel for the variable, set it to a **String**, **Editable**, **Replicated**, and enter **Empty** for the **Default Value**. 

	![](HowTo12.png)

	Setting this variable to **Replicated** ensures that it will be replicated over the network to connected machines. We are going to use this to simulate a character picking up an item in a multiplayer game when they enter a trigger volume and removing the item when they leave the trigger volume. 
	
1.	Add a **P** Key Event connected to a **Print String**, then hold **Control** and drag in the **Inventory** variable and connect as shown. 

	![](HowTo13.png)

1.	**Compile** and **Save** then close the **ThirdPersonCharacter** Blueprint. 

1.	From the **Modes** window under **Basic**, drag a **Box Trigger** into your level. 

	![](HowTo14.png)

	When a player character enters the trigger, we will update the variable we created, but only in the client that enters the trigger box. 

1.	In the **Details** panel for the **Box Trigger** under **Rendering**, un-check  **Actor Hidden In Game**. 

	![](UnHideBox.png)

	This will allow us to see the box in the level when we play in the editor making it easier to test. 

1.	Click the **Box Trigger** so that it is selected, then open the **Level Blueprint** from the Main Toolbar. 

	![](HowTo15.png)

1.	**Right-click** in the graph, then search for **Begin Overlap** and select the **Add On Actor Begin Overlap** event. 

	![](HowTo16.png)

1.	Repeat the previous step, but search for and add the **Add On Actor End Overlap** event. 

1.	Connect each node to the **Switch Has Authority** node. 

	![](HowTo17.png)

	The Switch Has Authority node checks where the script that is currently running is executing from, then can branch into two different directions based on whether the script is running on the network Authority (usually the Server) or a Remote machine (a client). 
	
	More often than not, you will want to use Authority for things you only want to occur on the server (these are usually gameplay critical, such as adjusting health values for players or giving out awards or loot items as you do not want to allow clients to determine when those types of changes are to occur to prevent cheating). 

	In this example, we are going to update a text variable, that could just as easily be a variable that contains the player's health or a variable for an item collected. 

1.	**Right-click** in the graph and add a **Custom Event** called **Add Item**. 

1.	Set the Replicates option to **Run on owning Client** and add an input called **Character** set to **Actor**. 

	![](HowTo18.png)

	[REGION:note]
	If you see an error warning on the node after creating it, click the **Compile** button to remove the error. 
	[/REGION]

1.	Create another **Custom Event** called **Remove Item** with the same settings as the **Add Item** event. 

1.	Connect the **Add Item** and Remove Item nodes as shown below off the two overlap events. 

	![](HowTo19.png)

	Here we are stating that when overlapping the trigger, if the overlap occurs on the server, run the **Add Item** event on the server and replicate it to the owning client (which is the character that overlaps the trigger). The "it" is the script that is called when **Add Item** is fired off and is only executed on the server but replicated to the client. When the character leaves the trigger box, again determined by the server, run the **Remove Item** event on the server and replicate it to the owning client. 

1.	Off the **Add Item** event, add a **Print String** (text set to **Item Added**) then drag off **Character** and **Cast To ThirdPersonCharacter**. 

	![](HowTo20.png)

1.	Off the **As Third Person Character** pin, search for and add the **Set Inventory** node with the text set to **Has the Item**. 

	![](HowTo21.png)

	Here we are taking the event that is executed on the server and is replicated to the client which prints to the screen "item added" then sets the **Inventory** text variable for the owning client to "Has the item". 

1.	Copy the three nodes following the **Add Item** event and connect them to the **Remove Item** event. 

1.	Change the **Print String** to **Item Removed** and the **Inventory** text variable to **Empty**. 

	![](HowTo22.png)

	Now when the character leaves the trigger, the text variable is updated on the server and replicated to the owning client. 

1.	**Compile** and **Save**, close the **Level Blueprint** then play in the editor. 

	[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
	[PARAMLITERAL:width]
	640
	[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[PARAMLITERAL:height]
	360
	[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
	KiBrcLbXbYQ
	[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[/OBJECT]

	In the video above when the game is launched, pressing P to print the text variable to the screen displays it as "empty" for each of the characters. However when one of the characters enters the trigger box, the text "item added" is displayed. When that character presses P, the text changes to say "has the item" while each of the other characters still displays "empty". When the character leaves the box, the text "item removed" is displayed and when they press P again, the text now changes back to "empty". 

	This example illustrates how you can run events on the server and replicate those events to individual clients.
