After you have imported or created your Character, Vehicle, or Flying Spaceship Asset, you will need to define how it reacts to Player Input. Defining Input is primarily done through user defined Bindings of **Action Mappings** (which are for key presses and releases) and **Axis Mappings** (which are for inputs that have a continuous range). 

Once you have defined your Mappings, you can then bind them to behaviors in Blueprints or C++ (see the Setup section below).
