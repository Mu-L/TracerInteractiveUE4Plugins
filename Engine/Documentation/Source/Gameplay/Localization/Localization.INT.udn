## Localizing Audio

Spoken text is now gathered from [Dialogue Wave](Engine/Audio/Overview#dialoguevoiceanddialoguewave) assets and included in your PO files for translation along with your other asset based text.

Several new [commandlets](Gameplay/Localization/Commandlets) have been added to facilitate the recording and importing of audio for your **Dialogue Wave** assets.
* ExportDialogueScript - Exports a per-culture CSV file containing each line of dialogue and its associated filename.
* ImportDialogueScript - Imports a copy-edited per-culture CSV file and updates any translations with the recorded dialogue.
* ImportLocalizedDialogue - Imports per-culture recorded WAV files and generates localized dialogue and sound wave assets.
