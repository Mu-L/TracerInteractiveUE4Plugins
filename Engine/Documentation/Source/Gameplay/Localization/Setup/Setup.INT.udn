Setting a project up for localization involves:
* writing localization configuration scripts for the commandlet pipeline.
* configuring where to load localization data from.
* specifying which localization data should be packaged for distribution. 

Conventionally, localization configuration scripts reside under `Config/Localization` while localization data resides under `Content/Localization`.

[REGION:note]
Setting up and iterating on localization is a manual process currently, but a dashboard UI for managing localization is in progress that will greatly simplify the workflow.

## Localization Configuration Scripts
The localization pipeline consists of [various commandlets](Gameplay/Localization/Commandlets) that handle gathering text, storing it, managing translations, and compiling them into binary forms 
for use by the engine. A master commandlet runs these other commandlets via a configuration file that specifies the steps to execute.

Typically, projects only require a single target that covers all of the text to be translated. A single configuration script then specifies all the steps and settings to run an iteration of 
localization automation - gathering text, generating manifests and archives, importing any new translations, exporting any new source, and generating a compiled binary format localization 
resource for use by the application.

Below is an example localization configuration script that implements the conventional localization process.

### Example Directory Structure
An example directory structure using a project called "MyProject", with two targets ("Game" and "DLC").
* MyProject
	* Config
		* Localization
			* Game.ini
			* DLC.ini

## Localization Data
Projects must be configured to use their localization data. Paths to search for localization data are specified in `Config/DefaultGame.ini` under the `Internationalization` section using array 
notation for the key `LocalizationPaths`. By default, localization data will be searched for in `Content/Localization/Game`, but this entry can be explicitly removed or replaced.

	+LocalizationPaths=%GAMEDIR%Content/Localization/DLC


### Example Directory Structure

## Packaging Settings
In order to package the project properly, the supported cultures' localization data need to be specified for packaging. Within the editor, under the **File** menu, open the **Package Project** submenu, and 
select **Packaging Settings...**. From the **Project Settings** window, under the **Packaging** category, expand the advanced section in order to access the **Localizations to Package** setting. You may check or uncheck 
which cultures should have their localization data packaged. English is checked by default.

Alternatively, these settings can be modified directly in the `Config/DefaultGame.ini` file without using the editor UI, underneath the section `/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings`, using the array 
notation for the key `CulturesToStage`.

[REGION:codetitlebar]
Config/DefaultGame.ini Excerpt

	[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]
	+CulturesToStage=en
	+CulturesToStage=fr
	+CulturesToStage=it
	+CulturesToStage=de
	+CulturesToStage=es


## Iteration
Iterating on localization data involves running the GatherText commandlet and providing a localization configuration script. The commandline should be of the form: 

	<ProjectFilePath> -Run=GatherText -Config=<PathToConfigFileRelativeToProjectRoot>
