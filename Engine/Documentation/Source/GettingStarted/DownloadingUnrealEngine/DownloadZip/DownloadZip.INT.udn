		[REGION:warning]
		The built-in Windows zip utility marks downloaded zip file contents as unsafe to execute.  
		Before decompressing the zip file:

		1.	**Right-click** the zip file.
		1.	**Click 'Properties...'**.
		1.	**Select 'Unblock'**.

		Third party zip utilities may not require the above mentioned steps prior to decompression.

	1.	Decompress 'UnrealEngine-(branch_name).zip' onto your hard disk.
	1.	If you already haven't done so, install Visual Studio 2013. Although MFC libraries are included in Visual Studio's default installation settings, make sure that MFC libraries are included for ATL support.
		[REGION:note]
		Developers build UE4 with all desktop editions of Visual Studio, including the latest version of [Microsoft's Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com/).
		[/REGION]
	1.	Open your source folder in Explorer and run **Setup.bat**.
		[REGION:note]
		Our Setup batch file downloads binary content for the engine, installs prerequesites, and sets up Unreal file associations. Downloading engine binaries may take some time because they currently take up three to four gigabytes of disk space. Subsequent checkouts take less time to download.
		[/REGION]
		[REGION:warning]
		A warning from SmartScreen may appear in Windows 8. **Click 'More Info'**, then **click 'Run Anyway'** to continue running our Setup batch file.
