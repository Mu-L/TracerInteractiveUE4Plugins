## Licensing and Contribution

Your access to and use of Unreal Engine on GitHub is governed by the [Unreal Engine End User License Agreement](https://www.unrealengine.com/eula). If you don't agree to those terms, as amended from time to time, you are not permitted to access or use Unreal Engine.

We welcome any contributions to Unreal Engine development through [pull requests](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/pulls/) on GitHub. Most of our active development is in the **master** branch, so we prefer to take pull requests there (particularly for new features). We try to make sure that all new code adheres to the [Epic coding standards](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Programming/Development/CodingStandard/).  All contributions are governed by the terms of the EULA.

## Next Steps

Now that you've downloaded and set-up Unreal Engine, you're ready to [build the engine from source](Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine).

#### Footnotes
The first time you start the editor from a fresh source build, you may experience long load times. 
The engine is optimizing content for your platform to the _derived data cache_, and it should only happen once.

Your private forks of the Unreal Engine code are associated with your GitHub account permissions.
If you unsubscribe or switch GitHub user names, you'll need to re-fork and upload your changes from a local copy.
