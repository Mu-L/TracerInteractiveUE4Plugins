	1.	If you already haven't done so, install Visual Studio 2013. Although MFC libraries are included in Visual Studio's default installation settings, make sure that MFC libraries are included for ATL support.

		Developers build UE4 with all desktop editions of Visual Studio, including Microsoft's free version ([Visual Studio Community 2013](https://www.visualstudio.com/products/visual-studio-community-vs)).

	1.	Open your source folder in Explorer and run **Setup.bat**. 
		[REGION:note]
		Our Setup batch file downloads binary content for the engine, installs prerequesites, and sets up Unreal file associations. Downloading engine binaries may take some time because they currently take up three to four gigabytes of disk space. Subsequent checkouts generally take less time to download.

## Next Steps

Now that you've downloaded and set-up Unreal Engine, you're ready to [build the engine from source](Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine).

[COMMENT:none]


There are two ways to get the source code for Unreal Engine from GitHub:

* Create a fork and clone the repository. 
* Download the source and unzip it to a folder.

## Fork and Clone

Forking the Unreal Engine repository gives you your own Unreal Engine repository on GitHub that you can clone, 
make changes to, etc. This is the preferred method of working with Unreal Engine source code. In addition, 
it enables you to take advantage of features such as being notified of changes to the Unreal Engine repository 
when we commit updates, easily pull in those updates, submit code back to Epic, and lots more.

**To fork the repository:**

1. Go to the [EpicGames/UnrealEngine repository](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine) on GitHub.

1. Click the ![Fork](button_fork_main.png) button.

1. Select your account in the popup.


Forking the repository is the first step, but the fork only exists on GitHub at this point. To actually work with the 
source code, you need to clone the repository to your computer. This basically makes a local working copy which you 
can then make changes to and commit those changes back to your repository on GitHub.

**To clone your repository:**

1. Go to your Unreal Engine repository on GitHub. This should be [YourGitHubUsername]/UnrealEngine.

1. Click the ![Clone in Dekstop](button_clone.png) button.

	If you do not have the GitHub client already installed, this will take you to the GitHub client installation page. Install the 
	client to proceed.

1. In the GitHub client, choose to clone the repository:

	[REGION:note]
	You can choose the location to clone your repositories to:
	
	1. Choose **Options** from the Tools menu:

		![](tools_options.png)

	1. Set the default directory to clone repositories to:

		![](repo_directory.png)
	[/REGION]

1. This will create an UnrealEngine folder on your local machine with all of the source code from the repository in it.

[REGION:warning]
If you clone, do not forget to switch to the correct branch for this release! (The 'master' branch has unstable code, 
so you will want to make sure to choose a release branch.)
[/REGION]

See [Fork A Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) for complete instructions on forking repositories 
on GitHub.

## Download Source Archive

You can download an archive of the source code for the current release directly from the repository page or 
from the [releases](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases) page. This is an easy way to get access 
to the source code, but it means you are just using GitHub as a means of downloading the source and you will 
lose out on all of the cool features associated with having the source on GitHub, such as being notified of 
changes to the source repository, submitting code back to Epic, and all of the community aspects involved.

Download one of the following:

* Download ZIP
* Source Code (zip)
* Source Code (tar.gz)


Unpack the downloaded archive to a location of your choosing on your computer.

## Next Steps

Now, you're ready to [build the engine](Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine).

 This section is deprecated per UE 4.8
## Installing Dependencies

In addition to the source code, there are dependencies that need to be installed in order to compile and run the 
engine. These are mostly binary files, content assets, and external libraries. 

After unziping the source code, you should have a file named `Setup.bat`. Running this file will install the dependencies needed.

[REGION:tip]
In version 4.5.1 and prior, the `Setup.bat` does not exist and the depencies must be downloaded separately. They can be found on the [releases](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/releases) page listed as "Required_1of2" and "Required_2of2". These must be extracted into the Unreal Engine folder.

## Next Steps

After installing the dependencies, you're ready to [build the engine](Programming/Development/BuildingUnrealEngine).
