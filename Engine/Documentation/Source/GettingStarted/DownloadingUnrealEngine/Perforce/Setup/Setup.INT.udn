Description:Guide to connecting to Epic's Perforce server to obtain Unreal Engine 4 builds.
version: 4.20
Order: 3

Epic Games makes QA-approved builds of Unreal Engine 4, as well as other specialized code drops, available to 
licensees through a Perforce depot that can be accessed externally. This is the method licensees use to first 
obtain the engine as well as update to new versions as they are released and it is deemed appropriate by the 
licensee. This document covers the steps to set up Perforce locally in order to connect to the Epic's Unreal 
Engine 4 depot and sync to a build of the engine.

To connect to Perforce, you need to first set up a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) connection to Epic Games. 
To learn about setting up and establishing a VPN connection, see the [Setting Up A VPN Connection](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/VPNSetup) page.

[REGION:red]
Epic Games has executed a custom licensing agreement with Perforce. To be in compliance with this license, only 
one machine per license should sync full builds, but multiple users may connect with the same login name to 
view source metadata and past revisions. Individual UDN login information will not work.
[/REGION]

In some cases, larger organizations may have an account for each team; even still, only one machine per team 
should sync full builds. Multiple machines syncing full builds is a violation of Perforce license agreement, 
as well as with Epic.

The complete process for downloading builds or revisions of Unreal Engine 4 from Epic's Perforce depot is detailed 
on the [Downloading Unreal Engine with Perforce](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/Perforce/Basics) page.

[REGION:warning]
	In order to keep our Perforce server running smoothly and efficiently, we have a tiered policy in place with regard 
	to disabling and removing accounts after periods of inactivity. 

	* Any Perforce account that is not used for over six (6) months will be disabled.  
	* Any Perforce account that is not accessed in over one (1) year will be removed.


	Both of these actions can easily be reversed, so please contact [P4AccountTrouble](mailto:P4AccountTrouble@epicgames.com) 
	if you find your account has been disabled or removed and we will restore it. If you have any questions please do not hesitate 
	to post on the [UDN](https://udn.unrealengine.com).

## Connectivity Policy

VPN connectivity to Epic comes in one of two ways. The first allows the studio to have up to five open VPN 
connections directly to Epic's proxy server from internal workstations (though only one machine is allowed 
to sync full builds). The second method allows for the studio to connect their own proxy directly to Epic's 
depot, from which the studio's developers will connect to their local proxy. Two concurrent VPN connections 
are allowed from this local proxy to the depot, a primary and a backup. 

Please understand that these methods are independent of each other and a studio cannot have both connection 
types in place. In either case, the number of concurrent P4 connections on a machine are not limited, just the 
number of VPN connections from a studio. 



## Installation and Configuration

In order to connect to Epic's Perforce depot, you will need a perforce client installed on the machine that 
will be used to download and store the engine builds.


### Setting Up P4V

The P4V client is the current client provided by Perforce. It provides access to versioned files through a 
graphical interface and also includes tools for merging and visualizing code evolution.

The full P4V installer can be downloaded from the [Perforce Downloads: The Essentials](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/downloads/index.html) page.

NOTE: Be sure to download the version that applies to your operating system, including 32- or 64-bit.

For a guide to setting up the P4V client to connect to Epic's Perforce depot, please see the [Setting up P4V](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/Perforce/P4V) page.


### Additional Downloads

For a complete list of available downloads including plugins and other tools, see the [Perforce Downloads](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/downloads/platform.html) page.


### Local Perforce Proxy

If you wish to run your own local proxy this is an option. The following information is only for those who wish 
to have more than 5 machines connected to Perforce.

Advantages of using a local proxy are:


* If a sync fails, a proxy keeps copies of what was synced. If you have to restart your sync, it will pull the 
data from your local proxy instead of Epic.
* Faster access to data for multiple users.


In order to use a proxy configuration, you must request it by making a request on the [Unreal Developer Network](http://udn.unrealengine.com). 
When this access is granted, you are only granted two VPN connections and you only have access to the primary depot, 
you will lose your access to the licensee proxy. 

You can obtain the proxy application (P4P) from Perforce at http://perforce.com/perforce/downloads/. During 
installation, you will need to configure your proxy server to chain to p4-server.epicgames.net.

Instructions for setting up a proxy can be found here : [http://www.perforce.com/perforce/r10.1/manuals/p4sag/09_p4p.html#1056059](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/r10.1/manuals/p4sag/09_p4p.html#1056059)


### Remote Depot

Please see the following thread for more information:

https://udn.epicgames.com/lists/showpost.php?list=unedit3&id=5885

Remote depot allows you to set up a Perforce server at your location; that server stays automatically synchronized 
with our server.  The benefit is that this offers an easy way to distribute the engine code within your organization. 
The downside is that only files are synchronized to the remote depot; users of the remote depot will be unable to see 
our change numbers, changelist information, and labels.

 

To set up a remote depot, please file a request on the [Unreal Developer Network](http://udn.unrealengine.com).


### Character Encoding

If you store Unicode files as text in Perforce, it will add in a 0xd to match the local line end; so the Unicode 
line end 0x0a 0x00 0x0d 0x00 will be converted to 0x0a 0x0d 0x00 0x0d 0x00 and break horribly. However, when it 
does this, it will leave your local version unchanged (and working). Sync to a previous version and then back to 
head to see the problem.

Perforce defines UTF-8 as Unicode. UTF-16 is ideal, provided no one accidentally converts to ASCII. Binary also 
works OK provided you do not miss merging or multiple checkouts.

Unreal Engine 4 will load ASCII or UTF-16 with BOM, provided they are valid files.



## East Asian Perforce Mirror

After [setting up a VPN connection](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/VPNSetup) and connecting to the [East Asian VPN mirror](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/VPNSetup#EastAsianVPNMirror), 
you should be able to connect to the proxy. Simply connect to p4-licensee-proxy-asia.epicgames.net on port 1667. 
The US proxy (p4-licensee-proxy.epicgames.net:1667) is available through this connection, but should only be used 
if the Asian proxy is not available.

If you are using a proxy to connect to our primary depot server (p4-server.epicgames.net:1666), compression should 
be disabled on the proxy server.  We are able to provide better performance for licensees using proxies by putting 
a WAN optimizer between our download locations.  Compression reduces the effectiveness of data reduction and this 
results in slower performance for you.  

For more information on disabling compression, review the section on P4P flags [here](http://www.perforce.com/perforce/doc.current/manuals/p4sag/09_p4p.html). 
If running Perforce as a service on a Windows server the command to turn compression off would look like this:

	p4 set -S "Perforce Proxy" P4POPTIONS="-c -p 1667 -t p4-server.epicgames.net:1666"

Note the "-c".  This turns off compression.



## Maintenance and Support


### Proxy Maintenance

Here is a script that will help to keep Proxy depots clean - preventing it from flooding over with revisions. We use 
this on our proxy. 


* [StartCleaning](StartCleaning.txt)


It is a VBScript that removes files that have not been accessed within a certain time period, keeping things nice and 
tidy. It is best to set up as a Windows "at job" or a scheduled task. Be sure to run it as a user with the appropriate 
permissions to the location on the file system.

The script can be called as:


    
    cscript StartCleaning.vbs [arguments]
    


[REGION:note]
This only works on Windows.  Also, if running on Windows Server 2008 R2, Vista or Windows 7, last access date is 
disabled by default.  You need to "fsutil behavior set disablelastaccess 0" to reenable last accessed date.
[/REGION]

### Scheduled Downtime

Epic's Perforce server is taken down every **Sunday at 2am EST for about 4 hours** for checkpoint verification, and 
database backup. In addition, Epic has set aside the **2nd and 4th Sunday of the month from 8am-Noon EST** for performing 
scheduled maintenance. Please keep this in mind when planning as it is possible that any or all of the support outlets, 
especially network/server resources, could be affected during these times.


### Connection Issues

If you are unable to connect to the Perforce depot for any reason, please post on the [Unreal Developer Network](http://udn.unrealengine.com).
