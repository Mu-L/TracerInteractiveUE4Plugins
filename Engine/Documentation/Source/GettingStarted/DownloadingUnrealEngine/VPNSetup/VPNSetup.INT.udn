[TOC(start:2)]

This document will guide you through the steps in setting up a secure Virtual Private Network (VPN) Connection to Epic Games so that you will be able to connect to the Perforce depot. Once you have a VPN Connection set up, you can [set up Perforce](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/Perforce/Setup).

Epic has set aside the **2nd and 4th Sunday of the month from 8am-Noon EST** for performing scheduled maintenance. Please keep this in mind when planning as it is possible that any or all of the support outlets, especially network/server resources, could be affected during these times.

[REGION:warning]
Your VPN credentials are not the same as your UDN credentials. There is one set of VPN/P4 credentials and they are issued on a per-project basis. Your technical contact will have this information.

## Connectivity Policy

VPN connectivity to Epic comes in one of two ways. The first allows the studio to have up to five open VPN connections directly to Epic's proxy server from internal workstations. The second method allows for the studio to connect their own proxy directly to Epic's depot, from which the studio's developers will connect to their local proxy. Two concurrent VPN connections are allowed from this local proxy to the depot, a primary and a backup. 

Please understand that these methods are independent of each other and a studio cannot have both connection types in place. In either case, the number of concurrent Perforce connections on a machine are not limited, just the number of VPN connections from a studio.

VPN setup is the same for your local proxy as it would be for a user.



## Supported Clients

The only currently supported client for creating a VPN connection is the AnyConnect VPN Client by [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com). This client has been tested and verified to run on all versions of Windows.


### Requirements

**General**

Some antivirus programs as well as firewalls can cause issues for the VPN connection. Make sure to configure them to allow the VPN connection to be established.

**Web Installation**

Please note that the following browsers are supported:


* Internet Explorer
* Firefox


Other browsers such as Chrome and Safari are not supported; they may work, but have not been tested. This should not be limiting as the browser is only needed for the initial connection.

In order to install the VPN client via the web, you will also need Java installed.



## Client Installation and Configuration

**NOTE:** The IPSEC/TCP VPN client has been phased out. Please use the SSL client.  System requirements for the Linux client can be found [here](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/security/vpn_client/anyconnect/anyconnect25/release/notes/anyconnect25rn.html#wp949967).


### Windows and Linux Installation via Browser

[EXCERPT:Browser]

NOTE: This is a web-based VPN client. It has been reported to be more stable when run in Internet Explorer.

[REGION:warning]
Be sure to disconnect from any existing VPN sessions you have open!

[/EXCERPT:Browser]

This process installs the AnyConnect client on your PC. This means you can simply run the application to connect in the future. It does not add an entry to the Start Menu in Windows, however. For details on connecting to the VPN manually using AnyConnect, see the [Connecting to the VPN via AnyConnect](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/VPNSetup#AnyConnect) section.

Once you set up the VPN connection, you can continue on to [set up Perforce](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/Perforce/Setup).


#### Additional Notes

If you are running Windows Vista, the feature that allows you to use the Internet and other local resources that are not on the VPN (while you are connected) will not work. As soon as you disconnect, everything should return to normal. 

Even still, if you are still experiencing problems, you can run the following commands at the MS-DOS command prompt:


    
    ipconfig /flushdns
    



(You may have to run the command prompt as an Administrator.)

Make sure to add the correct localgroups ("Users" and "Interactive") to get everything to work as normal.


### Windows Manual Installation

The AnyConnect VPN client can be downloaded from Cisco's website at the following URL:

[AnyConnect VPN Client Download](ftp://ftp.epicgames.com/anyconnect/anyconnect-win-3.0.4235.exe)

Once downloaded, simply install the application and then proceed to [Connecting to the VPN via AnyConnect](#AnyConnect) for details on how to use it to connect to the VPN.


### Linux Installation via Console

Please used the installers attached at the bottom of this article.

(#AnyConnect)



## Connecting to the VPN via AnyConnect

Connecting to the VPN with AnyConnect is a straightforward process.

[EXCERPT:AnyConnect]
1. Run the AnyConnect VPN Client.

	![vpn_anyconnect.jpg](vpn_anyconnect.jpg)(w:333)

1. Enter the _vpn.epicgames.com_ url into the **Connect to:** field:

	![vpn_anyconnect_url.png](vpn_anyconnect_url.png)

1. Press the **Enter** key to display the authentication fields:

	![vpn_anyconnect_login.jpg](vpn_anyconnect_login.jpg)(w:333)

1. Enter your VPN connection information (username and password) into the fields:

	![username and password](usernamepassword.png)

1. Press the **Connect** button to connect to the VPN. When the connection is made, the ![vpn_anyconnect_connected.jpg](vpn_anyconnect_connected.jpg) icon will show in the taskbar.
[/EXCERPT:AnyConnect]

Once you set up the VPN connection, you can continue on to [set up Perforce](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/Perforce/Setup).



## Connecting to the VPN via OpenConnect (Unsupported)

OpenConnect is an open source alternative to AnyConnect.  Since this package is maintained with a number of Linux distributions, it is more likely to work with distributions not supported by Cisco.  If the following packages are installed, you should be able to connect via OpenConnect:


* vpnc-script
* openconnect


These packages can usually be installed via yum (e.g. yum vpnc-script).

This is a sample connection command that allows batch connection:

    
    echo password > openconnect -u vpn_username --passwd-on-stdin --script /etc/vpnc/vpnc-script vpn.epicgames.com
    





## East Asian VPN Mirror

If you do not have it already, go to [https://asiavpn.epicgames.com](https://asiavpn.epicgames.com) and download the SSL VPN client.

Once installed, you can just add asiavpn.epicgames.com as the address in the client.



## Troubleshooting

**Installation**

Troubleshooting Installing the VPN AnyConnect Client:

In some cases, Windows users have received error messages related to an UTN_USERFirst_Hardware certificate upon trying to install the VPN client. This relates to a trust issue with the existing certificate and the new Cisco certificate. In order to resolve this issue, please use the following steps:


1. Open a run prompt and type in certmgr.msc.
1. Expand the tree labeled Third-Party Root Certification Authorities.
1. Find the certificate on the right labeled UTN_UserFirst_Hardware.
1. Cut this certificate from this location and paste it into Trusted Publishers.
1. Re-run the installer.

**Connecting**

Whenever you get the following error message, typically reinstalling the client & rebooting the machine should take care of it:


    
    Reason 442: Failed to enable Virtual Adapter.
    



The following message indicates an authentication problem on the server-side:


    
    Secure VPN Connection terminated by Peer.
    Reason 427: Unknown Error Occurred at Peer.
