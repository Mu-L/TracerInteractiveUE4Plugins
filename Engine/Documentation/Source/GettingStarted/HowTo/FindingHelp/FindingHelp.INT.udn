When working with **Unreal Engine 4**, if you come across something that you do not understand or would like more clarification on, do not become discouraged as there are several avenues you can use to learn more about the Editor or an aspect of the Editor you are working in. This page will highlight where you can go to learn more about the Editor or where to go to get answers to any questions you may have. 

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]

## In-Editor Help

In this section, we will take a look at the various methods in which you can access help inside the Editor (some of which will take you externally for additional help, documentation, or answers). 

### Rich Tooltips

The first method you can take to learn more about an aspect of the Editor is through the Editor's Rich Tooltips. 

Whenever you highlight something inside the Editor's interface, a tooltip will appear along with the option to expand upon that tooltip. 

![](RTT1.png)

Above we have highlighted the **Play** button from the Main Toolbar and a description of what the button does is displayed in the tooltip. In the lower right corner of the tooltip window, you will see the **Hold (Ctrl + Alt) for more** text, indicating that this tooltip has a Rich Tooltip as well. 

Press **Ctrl+Alt** to expand the tooltip to learn more about the action you highlighted. 

![](RTT2.png)

You can see now that the tooltip has been expanded for a more detailed explanation of what the **Play** action does and there is a see full documentation link at the bottom of the Rich Tooltip. Clicking on the see full documentation text will take you directly to the external [Unreal Engine 4 Documentation](#externalhelp:documentation) page related to and covering what the **Play** (or whatever you highlighted) action does and how to use it. 

### Help Icon

Some aspects of the Editor may have a **?** icon next to them.  

![](HelpIcon.png)

This **Help Icon** when clicked will take you to relevant external documentation related to object it is linked to.

Above we have clicked on a **Brush** Actor in our level, then in the **Details** panel, clicked the **?** Help Icon which automatically opened a documentation page on **Geometry Brush Actors**. This is useful when you are not sure what an object does or want to learn more about the object, but not sure where to look on the official documentation pages. 

### Documentation Actor

Sometimes you may see a rotating **?** icon inside the Level Editor Viewport, this is called a **Documentation Actor** (Doc Actor). 

![](DocActor.png)

When you click on this Actor in a level, the **Details** panel for the Actor will provide a link to external documentation related to the Actor. 

These are more commonly seen inside any of the Template Projects created from the [Project Browser](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) or in the [Content Examples](Resources/ContentExamples). 

![](DocActor_2.png)

Above, several Doc Actors are placed next to each of the **Content Examples** in the Animation level. Each one of these Doc Actors links to different documentation regarding the Content Example being shown and provides more detailed information about what is being demonstrated. Below, we have clicked on one of the Doc Actors and a documentation page on **Blend Spaces** was automatically opened.

### F1 Help

Inside the **Help Menu** noted above, next to **Documentation...** you may have noticed the **F1** text. 

![](F1_0.png)

Pressing **F1** is a keyboard shortcut to bringing up an Official Documentation page. The **F1 Help** button is context sensitive, meaning that depending on where you are in the Editor, a different help page may be presented to you. For example, below we are in the Main Editor View and pressing **F1** for help displays the home documentation page.

![](HelpSearch_2.png)

Above we have searched for Blueprints, the results show [In-Editor Tutorials](#in-editortutorials) related to Blueprints as well as links to external [Official Documentation](#externalhelp:documentation) related to Blueprints. There is also a link to [Answer Hub](#externalhelp:answerhub) where you can ask a question online and get help from Epic Staff as well as the Unreal Engine community. 

Not quite sure what it is you are looking for but have an idea of what you want to achieve? You can enter that into the search bar as well. 

![](HelpSearch_3.png)

Above we are searching for "How to display health". Depending upon your entry, there may be Official Documentation related to that very topic. There may also be [Wiki](#externalhelp:wiki) help or tutorials or even questions on Answer Hub that have been posed and answered. 

## In-Editor Tutorials

**In-Editor** Tutorials provide you with step-by-step instructions on how to navigate and use particular aspects of Unreal Engine 4. 

![](Tutorial_1.png)

While proceeding through each In-Editor Tutorial, you will be guided across the interface as well as given instructions on how to use the feature the tutorial covers. You will also be given links to external Official Documentation on the feature which will help you expand upon the topics that are covered in the tutorial itself. 

To proceed through an In-Editor Tutorial, click the green **Next** button in the lower right corner of the tutorial window. 

![](Tutorial_2.png)

More options for the In-Editor Tutorial can be found by clicking the dropdown arrow in the upper right corner of the tutorial window. 

![](Tutorial_3.png)

These options will allow you to **Exit** the tutorial, proceed to the ***Next** step in the tutorial, go **Back** to the previous step in the tutorial, **Restart** the tutorial or see **More Tutorials** that are available. 

You can access the In-Editor Tutorial hub by clicking the **More Tutorials** option noted above, or by clicking **Help** from the Menu Bar and selecting **Tutorials**.

## Content Examples

Another learning resource you can use to help answer any questions you may have is through the **Content Examples** project. 

[INCLUDE:Resources/ContentExamples#contentexamples]

You can download the Content Examples project from the **Learn** tab of the Unreal Engine Launcher. 

[REGION:note]
For more information, see the [Content Examples](Resources/ContentExamples) documentation.

## External Help: Documentation

When you want to learn about a particular feature or aspect of the Editor, the [Official Documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/index.html) is the place to start.

You can use the search field to search for the information you want to retrieve, or you can use the **Quick Search Terms** to browse commonly searched topics. Additionally, you can browse the documentation by topic. If you are new to Unreal Engine 4, **Getting Started** is a fine place to start. 

For those that want a more hands-on learning experience, you can take a look at **Quick Start** or **How-To** guides which will guide you step-by-step through the creation of a sample project (for Quick Start) or quick one-off learning experiences regarding a particular topic (for How-to's) as well as the **Samples & Tutorials** section. 

## External Help: Answer Hub

If you cannot find what you are looking for in the Official Documentation or have a specific question, you can search [Answer Hub](https://answers.unrealengine.com/index.html) to see if your question has been asked/answered by Epic Staff or the Unreal Engine community.

If you are new to Answer Hub, there is a Quick Start guide to using it which you can find [here](https://answers.unrealengine.com/static/how-to-use-answerhub.html). 


## External Help: Forums

Another resource for help is the [Official Unreal Engine 4 Forums](https://forums.unrealengine.com/forum.php).

The forums are broken up into several categories from Animation, Blueprints, and C++ Gameplay Programming to Android or iOS development or even Community Content, Tools, and Tutorials. The forums are largely community driven but Epic Staff does contribute to and respond to posts in the forums quite a bit. While Answer Hub is geared toward one-off questions and answers, the forums is a good place to start a discussion on a particular topic or how to 
approach creating something in Unreal Engine 4. 


## External Help: WIKI

The [Official Unreal Engine 4 Wiki](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Main_Page) is a place you can go for more Tutorials, Sample Projects, or Code samples.

The wiki is a community driven learning resource where users can post their own tutorials for others to use and learn from. Often times in Game Development, trial-and-error is the best method in which to learn something and with the wiki, you can learn from others who may have went through similar stumbling blocks as you. 

Say you want to create a Double Jump for a character or do not know where to begin for creating a multiplayer game, you can check the wiki to see if the community has posted a page on either topic already and may be exactly what you are looking for.
