Order:

1. [Set up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [fork our repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/).
   If you'd prefer not to use Git, use the 'Download ZIP' button on the right to get the source as a zip file.

1. Open your source folder and run **Setup.sh** to download binary content for the engine.

1. Both cross-compiling and native builds are supported. 

   **Cross-compiling** is handy when you are a Windows (Mac support planned too) developer who wants to package your game for Linux with minimal hassle, and it requires a [cross-compiler toolchain](http://cdn.unrealengine.com/qfe/v8_clang-3.9.0-centos7.zip) to be installed (see the [Linux cross-compiling page on the wiki](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/Linux/GettingStarted/)).

   **Native compilation** is discussed in [a separate README](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine/blob/release/Engine/Build/BatchFiles/Linux/README.md) and [community wiki page](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Building_On_Linux).
