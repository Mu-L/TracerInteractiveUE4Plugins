Order:

1.	Install [GitHub for Mac](https://mac.github.com/) then [fork and clone our repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/). 

	To use Git from the Terminal, see the [Setting up Git](https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git/) and [Fork a Repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) articles.
	If you'd rather not use Git, use the 'Download ZIP' button on the right to get the source directly.

1.	Install the latest version of [Xcode](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835).

1.	Open your source folder in Finder and double-click on **Setup.command** to download binary content for the engine. You can close the Terminal window afterwards.

	If you downloaded the source as a .zip file, you may see a warning about it being from an unidentified developer (because .zip files on GitHub aren't digitally signed).
	To work around it, right-click on Setup.command, select Open, then click the Open button.

1.	In the same folder, double-click **GenerateProjectFiles.command**.  It should take less than a minute to complete.  

1.	Load the project into Xcode by double-clicking on the **UE4.xcworkspace** file. Select the **ShaderCompileWorker** for **My Mac** target in the title bar, then select the 'Product > Build' menu item. When Xcode finishes building, do the same for the **UE4** for **My Mac** target. Compiling may take anywhere between 15 and 40 minutes, depending on your system specs.
   
1.	After compiling finishes, select the 'Product > Run' menu item to load the editor.
