## Running the Editor

[INCLUDE:#RunEditor]

## Running an Uncooked Game

Once a project is loaded in Unreal Editor, you can [test your gameplay](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/InEditorTesting#modes) in Uncooked Game mode from the **Play In** menu. 
To play the uncooked game in its own window, select the [New Window At > Default Player Start mode](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/InEditorTesting#modes) using 
the [Play In dropdown menu](Engine/UI/LevelEditor/InEditorTesting#toolbar) in the Level Editor toolbar.

Running the uncooked game version of the engine executable using either of the below methods will result in the same behavior.

### Running an Uncooked Game from the Command Line

[PUBLISH:Licensee]
When running the game from the command line, you must specify the game you want to run as an argument to the `UE4Editor.exe` executable via the 
**Target** property of a shortcut, as well as specify the `-game` parameter to tell the editor to run in game mode instead of bringing up the editor UI.

1.	From a command prompt, navigate to the `\Engine\Binaries\Win64` directory of your `UE4` directory.

1.	Run the `UE4Editor.exe -game` passing it the name of the game to run:

|Project Location|Command Prompt|
|----------------|--------------|
|UE4 Root | `UE4Editor.exe MyGame -game`|
|Alternate Location| `UE4Editor.exe "[ProjectPath]\[ProjectName].uproject" -game`|

[/PUBLISH:Licensee]

[PUBLISH:Rocket]
When running from the command line, you must pass the name of the project you want to run along with the `-game` switch as arguments.

## Running a Cooked Game

See [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Packaging) for information on how to package and run cooked game builds.

## Useful In-Game Commands

When you are running the game, there are a multitude of **console commands** you can use in the console inside the game. 
The console can be summoned by pressing the **~ (tilde)** or **Tab** keys. Some of the most useful commands are listed 
below.

$ EXIT/QUIT : 
Exits the game; closing down the engine.
$ DISCONNECT : 
Exits the game; returning to the main menu (if one is present).
$ OPEN [MapURL] : 
Loads a new map using the specified URL using all previous settings. A URL is a map name (without the file extension) followed by an optional list of parameters  which can be used to specify certain options, such as the gametype, player class, player name, team number, etc.
$ TRAVEL [MapURL] : 
Loads a new map using the specified URL and resets all settings. See above for a description of map URLs.
$ VIEWMODE [Mode] : 
Sets the rendering mode of the game viewport to the specified mode. The available modes are:
	| Mode | Description |
	| ---- | ----------- |
	| WIREFRAME | Shows the wireframe of all meshes. |
	| UNLIT | Renders meshes using only the diffuse channel of materials. |
	| LIT | Default. Renders meshes using their materials being affected by lighting. |
	| DETAILLIGHTING | Renders meshes using a neutral-colored material with normals being affected by lighting. |
	| LIGHTINGONLY | Renders meshes using a neutral-colored material without normals being affected by lighting. |
	| LIGHTCOMPLEXITY | Renders meshes using a solid color based on the number of dynamic lights affecting the mesh. Black means no dynamic lights affect the mesh. As more lights affect the mesh, the color goes from green to red. |
	| SHADERCOMPLEXITY | Renders meshes using solid colors based on the number of shader instructions executed by the material applied to the surface. The colors range from green (0) to red (300) to pink (600) to white (900). |

## Loading Maps

It is possible to specify a particular map to load when running the engine or editor or load a new map while running 
the engine. This can be useful for testing by quickly jumping into the map you want to test without needing to make 
your way through a series of menus.

### Loading Maps at Startup

The engine will always attempt to load a default map when it is run. This map is specified in the `DefaultEngine.ini` 
config file located in the `Config` folder of your game project. The map to run by default is set using the **Map** 
property in the `[URL]` section of the .ini file. As an example, VehicleGame has the following in its `DefaultEngine.ini` 
file:

	[URL]
	...
	Map=/Game/Maps/VehicleMenu
	...

This will cause the `VehicleMenu.umap` (located in `[UE4Directory]\VehicleGame\Content\Maps`) to load at startup unless it is overridden. Generally, you will want to 
specify the map that loads or is used as the background for your main menu as the default map.

[PUBLISH:Licensee]
To override the default map, you can pass in a map name (without the file extension) as a command line argument. It 
was mentioned previously that you must specify the game name on the command line. Following these, you can also specify 
a map name to force the engine to load a map other than the default. For instance, the following command line could be 
used to load the engine in uncooked game mode running the `ExampleMap` map:

	UE4Editor.exe [Gamename] ExampleMap -game
[/PUBLISH:Licensee]

[PUBLISH:Rocket]
To override the default map, you can pass in a map name (without the file extension) as a command line argument. It 
was mentioned previously that you must specify the project name on the command line. Following these, you can also specify 
a map name to force the engine to load a map other than the default. For instance, the following command line could be 
used to load the engine running the `ExampleMap` map:

The same concept works when running the editor. Specifying the name of the map to load following the `editor` argument 
will load that map when the editor opens instead of the default or blank map. To load the editor with the `ExampleMap` 
map loaded, the following command line can be used:

	UE4Editor.exe [GameName] ExampleMap
[/PUBLISH:Licensee]

[/OBJECT]

[REGION:tip]
	The map name can also be a full map URL specifying additional settings such as the GameMode. Settings are appended 
	to the map name as key-value pairs separated by a `?`. For example:
	
		DM-Deck?Game=CaptureTheFlag

[/REGION]

### Loading New Maps

If you want to load a new map during play, in order to test during development or even to switch maps during gameplay, 
this can be done using the `OPEN` or `TRAVEL` console commands followed by the name of the map (without the file extension) 
to load. 

[REGION:note]
The difference between the `OPEN` and `TRAVEL` commands is described above in the [Useful In-Game Commands](#UsefulIn-GameCommands) section.
[/REGION]

The commands below load the DM-Deck map during play with the same settings or settings reset, respectively:

	open DM-Deck

Or

	travel DM-Deck

This process will launch a copy of Unreal Editor.

[/PUBLISH:Licensee]

[PUBLISH:Rocket]

The process of running the editor simply requires passing the name of the project to run as an argument to the executable.

[REGION:note]
You can add the `-debug` switch to force the executable to load the debug version of the modules for your project, which 
contain all of the debugging symbols. This is necessary even when debugging through Visual Studio with the configuration 
set to **Debug** because the main executable is always compiled using the **Development** configuration. Of course, you 
must first compile your modules using the Debug configuration so they exist for the executable to load.

### Running the Editor with No Arguments (Stand-alone)

If the editor is not set to open the most recent project at startup, running the editor executable without any arguments will launch the Project Browser. From here, you can 
[create a new project](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser#creatingnewprojects), [open your existing projects](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser#openingprojects),
