## Creating Your First Project

When you open Unreal Editor, the Project Browser will appear. The Project Browser provides a jumping off point from which you can create projects, open your existing projects, or open 
sample content like sample games and Showcases.

## Compiling Code Projects

If you create a project with the Blank template, or any of the Blueprints Only templates, you can immediately begin working with your project in Unreal Editor.  When working with any game
or engine C++ code, however, you will need to compile your code in order to see any changes reflected in the game.
