[COMMENT:none]
 Note the primary paths to creating mods, why the primary mod paths exist, how stacking works, and finally, it's UE4, you can also just do whatever

## Weapons

Tools of the trade for any Robo Ready Recall Specialist. Have an idea for a new lightning gun that chains from bot to bot? How about a classic Katana sword? Flamethrower?

## Maps

The places where all the action takes place! Want to save a small ocean side villa from rampaging bots? Or take the fight to a frozen medieval castle? That's where your custom maps will come into play.

## Robots

## Bosses

The boss in Robo Recall has a number of special features that separate it from the other bots, as such he's gets his own sections discussing how he works.

## Player

Want to change the hands of your Robo Ready Recall Specialist? Adjust some base stats? Give him/her a full body? Grant them super powers? Creating a custom VR Pawn enables you to do all this and more!

## Advanced

The thing to remember when modding Robo Recall is that you have access to the entire Unreal Engine 4 editor, Robo Recall's source code, and most of the art assets used in the game (outside of a few licensed assets). To this end, you should check out the rest of the Unreal Engine Documentation,the Unreal Engine forums, and the Unreal Engine Answer Hub, where you'll find tons of information on making games! And if you get stuck, post a question on the Unreal Engine Forums or in the Answer Hub.
