Support for Android devices is not new to the Unreal Engine; however, there are some additional requirements when working with augmented reality and Unreal. In addition to the standard Unreal Engine configuration for Android, there is an additional step of installing the ARCore app on the Android device. If you are already working with Unreal Engine and Android devices, this may be the only step that is required to start working with augmented reality and Unreal Engine.

## General Prerequisites

The basic configuration of Unreal Engine and Android devices is covered in detail in the [Android Game Development](Platforms/Mobile/Android) section of the Unreal Engine documentation.
