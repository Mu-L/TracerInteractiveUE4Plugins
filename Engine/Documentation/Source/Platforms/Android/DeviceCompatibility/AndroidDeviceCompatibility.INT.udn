Android support is still in its early stages and we have not yet tested on a broad range of devices. We plan to 
expand and refine this section as new devices are released and we broaden the devices we are testing in house.

For a community-driven list of known device compatibility, see the [Android Device Compatibility](https://wiki.unrealengine.com/Android_Device_Compatibility) wiki page.

These tables reference feature tiers as described on the [](Platforms/Mobile/Performance) page.

[REGION:raw]
* %Supported% Supported - We have tested the family of devices here and expect them to perform well.
* %Expected% Expected - We have not tested the family of devices extensively but expect them to perform well.
* %Unsupported% Unsupported - We do not expect the device to perform well for the feature tier.

The following table lists common GPU families.

[REGION:section]
(#Nexus5)
**1:** The Nexus 5 with the latest publicly available driver performs poorly when using features from the Full HDR tier. We have been working closely with Qualcomm in this area and they have developed faster drivers that remove the bottlenecks we were running in to. Our HDR features are fully supported on their latest internal drivers which we hope will be available to the public soon!
(#KindleFireHDX)
**2:** Similar to the Nexus 5, the Kindle Fire HDX runs in to some bottlenecks in the Adreno 330 driver and we expect it to perform well in the future with an updated driver.

**3:** Unreal Engine version 4.8 and later will now support the use of **ES31** and **AEP** rendering on Tegra K1 devices. 
Please note that due to the limited number of devices that currently support ES31 and AEP rendering very little performance and compatibility testing has been completed at this time.
If you are developing a project that is aimed at using one of theses devices it is highly recommended that you perform extensive performance and compatibility testing to ensure that the device delivers your project in the manner you intended.
