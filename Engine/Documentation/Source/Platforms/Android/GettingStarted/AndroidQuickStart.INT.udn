Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) uses a special version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), called **CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1**. 
This version of CodeWorks for Android is the easiest way to set up the SDK and Native Development Kit (NDK) needed to develop 
Android projects with UE4. Although we're currently using version 1R6u1, we intend to use subsequent releases of CodeWorks. 
If you have other versions of the Android SDK installed (or, older versions of CodeWorks for Android), we recommend that you 
uninstall them and install CodeWorks for Android, using the CodeWorks for Android installer that's being distributed with UE4. 

[region:note]
We've bundled the CodeWorks for Android installer with UE4 to make sure that your Android SDK will be compatible with Unreal Engine. 
In UE4.18 the Gradle build system is enabled by default. But, this requires accepting the SDK License agreement in **Project Settings** > **Android** (button is disabled if the agreement has been previously accepted). Press the button, read the agreement, then Accept it. After that, the button should be grayed out. You can still use the Ant build system in 4.18 by clearing the **Enable Gradle instead of Ant** Check box.
