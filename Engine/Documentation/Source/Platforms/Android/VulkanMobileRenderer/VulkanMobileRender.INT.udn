Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) has built in support for the **Vulkan** graphics API. Vulkan is a low-overhead, cross-platform 3D graphics library that gives developers more control over the GPU and lower level CPU usage for their Android base mobile projects. In the following document, we will go over how you can enable and use Vulkan in your UE4 Android projects.

[region:warning]
Vulkan is currently under heavy development and should be considered a **experimental feature** at this point in time. If you wish to build and deploy a mobile project using Vulkan, you will need to download and compile UE4 version 4.12 or later from the UE4 Github branch. 
[/region]

## Vulkan Video Drivers for PC Development
To make sure that you can visualize the rendering options Vulkan has available on your development PC, you will need to make sure you download and install the latest version of video card drivers for your graphics card. Below you will find the minimal driver version you need to use to be able to preview what Vulkan will look like on your development PC.

* **NVIDIA**: Driver 367.27 or later
* **AMD**: Driver 16.3 or later  

## Supported Vulkan Devices
Currently, only the following mobile device chipsets have support for the Vulkan API. 

* **Nexus 6P** (Android N Devices)
* **Galaxy S7** (Mali & Adreno variants)

[region:note]
Please note that the ability to use the Vulkan API depends on if your mobile carrier has released the Vulkain update for your specific device variant. To find if this support has been pushed to your mobile device, you will need to contact your mobile carrier.

## Building for Vulkan 
To build a UE4 project that has support for the Vulkan API you will need to do the following:

1. Before you begin, make sure that you have your Android smartphone plugged into your development PC via USB and that your Android smartphone has developer mode enabled. 

1. Next, download and compile the latest version of UE4 from the UE4 Github branch as the binary version you get from the launcher will not allow you to build for Vulkan.

	[region:note]
	 If you are unsure how to do this check out the [Download Unreal Engine Source Code](GettingStarted/DownloadingUnrealEngine/) page for detailed instruction on what to do.
	[/region]

1. Then go to [https://vulkan.lunarg.com/signin](https://vulkan.lunarg.com/signin) and in the download section, click on the **Windows** option.

1. Once the download completes, run the **VulkanSDK-1.0.17.0** installer and follow the prompts to install the Vulkan SDK. When the Vulkan SDK has finished installing, reboot your PC to make sure that the environment variables are set properly. 

1. When your PC finished rebooting open up your system's **Environment Variables** and check for the **Vulkan_SDK** in the **Variable** section.

1. Once UE4 has finshed building, Launch the UE4 Editor and create a new project using the following settings:

	* Blueprint Project
	* Blank Template
	* Mobile / Tablet
	* Maximum Quality
	* No Starter Content

## Enabling Vulkan Preview Rendering in Editor
You can enable the ability to use the Vulkan render while inside of the UE4 Editor, you will need to do the following in your project:

1. From the **Main Toolbar** go to the **Edit** option and then select the **Editor Preferences** option from the menu.

	![](VMP_00.png)

1. In the **General** section under the **Experimental** category, expand the **Rendering** section and click on the checkmark box next to the **Enable Metal/Vulkan/High-end mobile Preview Rendering Level in editor**.

	[/REGION]

	[region:note]
	After doing this, the Editor will need to recompile the entire shader cache to include the required Vulkan options. Depending on the size of your project and power of your development computer, this process could take anywhere from a few minutes to an hour or more to complete.
	[/region]

1. On the **Main Toolbar**, click on the **Settings** button and go to the **Preview Rendering Level** option and select the **High-End Mobile / Metal** option to enable OpenGL ES 3.1 previewing in the UE4 viewport.

	[/REGION]

1. In the lower right-hand conner of the UE4 Editor viewport you should see the text, **Feature Level: ES3_1**. If you see this text then everything is setup correctly and you are now seeing what your project will look like when viewed on a device that supports the Vulkan API.
