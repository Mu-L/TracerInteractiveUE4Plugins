If you're a fledgling developer, you'll want to start off with this learning path, where you'll setup a typical workflow for Linux game development. 
By the end of this learning path, you'll setup an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), you'll have a thorough understanding of the Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) 
user interface, and you'll gain some experience by developing a game on Linux.
