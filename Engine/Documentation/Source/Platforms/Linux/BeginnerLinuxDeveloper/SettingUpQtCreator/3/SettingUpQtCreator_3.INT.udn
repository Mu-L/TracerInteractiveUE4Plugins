Now that you've configured Qt Creator to build and run UE4, you're ready to run UE4 from the IDE. Before you run UE4 from the IDE, you'll want to open some output windows so that you can see 
Unreal Build System at work.

1.	Click the **Edit** button to enter into Edit mode, opening Qt Creator's editor.

	While in Edit mode, you can view, debug, and edit the CPP source code powering UE4.

1.	By default, Qt Creator hides the main toolbar. Hover your mouse cursor over the top of the screen, touching the top edge to reveal the toolbar.

At this point, you should see the compiler flushing messages to the **Compile Output** window inside of the IDE. 
Depending on your system's specifications, it may take anywhere from ten minutes to over an hour to compile the engine. 
If you want to shorten the time it takes to compile the engine from source, we recommend compiling the source code on a 
machine that has at least eight (8) gigabytes of RAM with a multi-core processor having at least eight (8) cores (including 
hyperthreading).
