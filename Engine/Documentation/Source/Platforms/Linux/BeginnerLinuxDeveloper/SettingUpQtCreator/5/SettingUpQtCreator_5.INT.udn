You can create either Blueprint or CPP projects from the [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) in UE4. In this section, we'll show you how to create a new Blueprint project from UE4. 
For the purposes of this guide, let's suppose that you want to 
create a new Blueprint game with a flying mechanic. Fortunately, UE4 is shipped with the perfect template for you!

Congratulations! You've just created a new Blueprint project from UE4 with the help of a Blueprint project template. 
Creating any type of Blueprint project, with or without a project template, is now within your reach. There are times; 
however, when you'll want to create and modify the source code driving 
your game. In the next section, we'll show you how to create a new CPP project from UE4.
