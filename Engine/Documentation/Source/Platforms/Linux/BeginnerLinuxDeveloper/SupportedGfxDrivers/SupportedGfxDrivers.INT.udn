Unreal Engine requires compatible hardware and software support in order to run smoothly on your 
machine. In an effort to help you determine your ideal development environment, we're providing 
the following table of supported graphics drivers for developing games on Linux.

Graphics drivers are typically provided by manufacturers for testing and integration with Unreal
Engine 4 (UE4). If you want to get the most out of UE4 while maintaining hardware performance, please 
make sure to update your graphics driver appropriately.

## NVIDIA Graphics Drivers

If you're running an NVIDIA graphics driver version older than version 347.09, consider updating your graphics driver 
to prevent your system from crashing while running the engine. Also, it's important to note that the 
latest graphics drivers aren't guaranteed to work with UE4. Please refer back to our list of supported graphics
drivers in order to verify that your graphics driver will work properly with the engine.

## AMD Graphics Drivers

If you're running an AMD graphics driver version older than 14.301.1001.0, you should update your graphics driver to prevent 
your system from crashing while running the engine.

## Intel Graphics Drivers

If your system has Mesa drivers, we recommend that you update your driver to be newer than Mesa 10.5.x.
