[EXCERPT:AndroidLinux_1]
Unreal Engine 4 uses a special version of the Android Software Development Kit (SDK), called CodeWorks for Android. CodeWorks for Android is the easiest way to set up the SDK and Native Development Kit (NDK) needed to develop Android projects with Unreal Engine 4. If you have older versions (prior to version 1R5) of the Android SDK installed (or, older versions of CodeWorks for Android), we recommend that you uninstall them and install [CodeWorks for Android](https://developer.nvidia.com/codeworks-android), using the CodeWorks for Android installer that is distributed with Unreal Engine 4.

[REGION:note]
We've bundled the CodeWorks for Android installer with Unreal Engine 4 to make sure that your Android SDK will be compatible with the Engine. It's important to note that, as of Unreal Engine version 4.16, the Engine includes CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1.
[/REGION]

## Installing CodeWorks for Android

For the purpose of showing you how to get started with Android on Linux, we will use CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1 while working with Unreal Engine version 4.14. The Engine should be closed before installing CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1. Also, please make sure that you have Java Development Kit 8 (JDK 8) installed, with your `JAVA_HOME` environment variable set to the correct version of the Java Development Kit (JDK). To verify that `JAVA_HOME` is set properly, enter `echo $JAVA_HOME` into the terminal. If you don't see the correct JDK version, [download JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html), and install it on your Linux computer, making sure to set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable to the newly installed JDK.

[REGION:warning]
Before continuing, please note that Android Vulkan on Linux is not supported at this time.

1.	Getting started, open the Terminal and navigate to the `[UE4Root]` folder that contains the compiled engine (using the `cd` command, changing the shell working directory).

1.	From inside of the `[UE4Root]` folder, navigate to the CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1 binary file (**CodeWorksforAndroid-1R6u1-linux-x64.run**) by entering the following string into the terminal: `cd Engine/Extras/AndroidWorks/Linux`.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step1.png)(w:900)

1.	Now, enter `ls -l` into the terminal, displaying a long listing of the directory's contents.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step2.png)(w:900)

	The file's permission settings tell you that **CodeWorksforAndroid-1R6u1-linux-x64.run** is not ready for execution. Before you can run the CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1 binary, you need to change the file's access rights to allow for "execute" permissions.

1.	To change the file permission settings of `CodeWorksforAndroid-1R6u1-linux-x64.run`, enabling it to run like a normal executable, enter `chmod +x CodeWorksforAndroid-1R6u1-linux-x64.run` into the terimal.

	[REGION:tip]
	If you want to learn more about the `chmod` command, enter `man chmod` into the terminal to read the manual page covering how `chmod` works.
	[/REGION]

1.	Now, enter `ls -l` into the terminal.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step4.png)(w:900)

	The file's permission settings highlighted in the image indicate that the CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1 binary file is ready for execution.

1.	To run the CodeWorks for Android binary, enter `./CodeWorksforAndroid-1R6u1-linux-x64.run` into the terminal.

1.	Now, from the **Android Developer's Welcome Window**, click the **Next** button to continue the installation process.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step8.png)(w:900)

1.	Specify the directory where CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1 should be installed and downloaded.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step9.png)(w:900)

1.	Click the **Next >** button to download CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1 from NVIDIA, ultimately installing CodeWorks on your computer.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step10.png)(w:900)

1.	Now, verify that you're installing **CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1** before clicking the **Next** button from the **Android Component Manager** window.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step11.png)(w:900)

1.	After the **Terms and Conditions** window appears, take some time to read through all of the **Terms and Conditions** before selecting the **Accept All** check box.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step12.png)(w:900)

1.	Now, click the **Accept** button to begin the installation process.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step13.png)(w:900)

1.	Once the installer completes the installation process, go ahead and click the **Next >** button to proceed.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step14.png)(w:900)

1.	After the **Installation Complete** window opens, click the **Finish** button to complete the installation.
