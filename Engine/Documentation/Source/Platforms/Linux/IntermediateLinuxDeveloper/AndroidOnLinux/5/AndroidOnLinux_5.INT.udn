Up to this point in the tutorial, you've created and deployed your mobile game project to an Android device; however, if you want to make your game distributable, you'll need to package the project. 
The following steps show you how to package your project for distribution on the Android platform. Before we begin, it's important to note that you're going to package the project in **Development** mode. It's always a good practice to initially package your game in **Development** 
mode for testing purposes. Once you're satisfied with your game, you can package the project in **Shipping** mode, which tells the engine to strip out console commands, statistics, and profiling tools.

1.	Open the **Android_ETC1** folder, where you'll find the files that were created during the packaging process.

	![](LinuxAndroid_Step37.png)

	You should see the **Installation** and **Uninstallation** shell scripts (\*.sh) along with the Android Application Package (\*.apk) that contains all of the files you need to 
	install the project onto any Android device that supports the ETC1 compression scheme.

1.	Now, open up the terminal from this folder's location by right-clicking inside of the folder and selecting **Open in Terminal**.

1.	Enter `./Install_LinuxAndroidProject_Development-arm64.es2.sh` into the terminal to install the project onto your Android device.

	If you're having trouble running the shell script, try entering `adb devices` into the terminal to verify that your device is indeed, connected to your computer.

1.	During the installation process, the shell script should flush the following output to your terminal.
