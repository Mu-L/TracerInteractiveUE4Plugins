[EXCERPT:Usage]
## Caching your Achievements

**Cache Achievements** will request from the platform's game service the list of achievements and the values the current player has for said achievements. You'll be able to use the **Get Cached Achievement Value** if this node returns successfully.

Note that it is a **latent** node, and thusly has a number of execution output pins. The top most is a "pass through," that works like any other execution output pin. The other two pins (**On Success**, and **On Failure**) will execute when the online service returns (or fails to return) a value. When the execution returns a success

**In Blueprints:**

The example below is from the **Global Game Instance** Blueprint in the Unreal Match 3 sample game. After the user logs into the device's game platform (Game Center, Google Play), we run the **Cache Achievements** node and actually halt execution (by not having anything execute off the top output execution pin) at this point to give the service time to return all the achievements:

## Reading Values from your Achievements

The **Get Cached Achievement Progress** will return the progress of a given **Achievement ID** for the provided **Player Controller**, and only work if a **Cache Achievements** node was run earlier and returned successfully.

For iOS Game Center, this value is actually a floored float, as they store it as an integer. A float is received for Google Play Services.

**In Blueprints:**

The example below is from the **Global Game Instance** Blueprint in the Unreal Match 3 sample game. Once the achievements are cached, we run through a loop pulling achievement names, as well as their target scores, from arrays, and do a quick comparison to any offline values found. We then accept the higher value of the service or the local values:

## Writing Values to your Achievements

The **Write Achievement Progress** will send a message up to the platform's achievement system to write a percentage (0.0% - 100.0%) based **Progress** to the provided achievement for the given user (**Player Controller** and **User Tag**). For "one off" achievements you will always pass in `100.0` for **Progress**, while for incremental achievements, you'll be passing in some lesser percentage until the user reaches `100.0` for that achievement.

For iOS Game Center, this value is actually sent as an integer, as they only have 1-100 incremental achievements. A float is sent for Google Play Services.

Note that it is a **latent** node, and thusly has a number of execution output pins. The top most is a "pass through," that works like any other execution output pin. The other two pins (**On Success**, and **On Failure**) will execute when the online service returns (or fails to return) a value. When the execution returns a success the **Written Achievement Name**, **Written Progress**, and **Written User Tag** will return non-null values equal to what you passed into the node.

**In Blueprints:**

The example below is from the **Global Game Instance** Blueprint in the Unreal Match 3 sample game. There's a loop that compares the current achievement value to the metrics required to increase that achievement, and if progress has been made, the **Write Achievement** event is called:

[REGION:note]
This was done because latent nodes can't be used in Functions.

## Showing the Platform Specific Achievement Screen

The **Show Platform Specific Achievement Screen** will show the achievements of the provided **Player Controller** for the current platform.

**In Blueprints:**

The example below is from the **GameOverButtons** Blueprint Widget in the Unreal Match 3 sample game. When the **ShowAchievements** button is pressed, the game will attempt to show the achievement screen for the current platform.
