[TOC]

All Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Android-based projects offer support for using either the standard pop up dialog input box or the operating system's virtual keyboard. In the following document, we will take a look at how to set up and call either virtual keyboard in your UE4 projects.

    [REGION:note]
    Keep in mind that your application is responsible for ensuring input elements are visible and not obscured behind the virtual keyboard. You can use the supplied **OnVirtualKeyboardShown** and **OnVirtualKeyboardHidden** event handlers to make sure that UI elements do not obscure the virtual keyboard.

6.  Open up the **Level Blueprint** and add the following nodes to the Event Graph.

    *   **Event Begin Play**    
    *   **Create Widget**    
    *   **Add to Viewport**        

7.  Connect the **Event Begin Play** node to the **Create Widget** node and then connect the **Create Widget** node to the **Add Viewport** node. When completed your **Level Blueprint** should look like the following image.

9.  Save the level, giving it a name of **AndroidVirtualKeyboard** then open up your Project Settings and go to **Maps & Modes** and in the **Default Maps** input the **AndroidVirtualKeyboard** map into the **Editor Startup Map** and the **Game Default Map**.

## End Result

Once your project launches on your Android device, press on the text input box and when you do, you should now be able to input the text you want using the Android system keyboard like in the following video.

You can also disable the virtual keyboard using the **Android.NewKeyboard** console variable followed by one of the following numbers. Doing this is particularly useful when the user is using a language requiring a different IME (Input Method Editor).

[REGION:simpletable] 
| Command Name | Input | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Android.NewKeyboard** | 0 | Uses the check mark box setting that was set in the UE4 editor. |
| **Android.NewKeyboard** | 1 | Forces the new keyboard to be used. |
| **Android.NewKeyboard** | 2 | Forces the dialog to be used. |
