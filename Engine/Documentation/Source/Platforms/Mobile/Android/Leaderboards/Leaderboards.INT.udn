## Configuration

Please see [Leaderboards | Play Games Services | Google Developers](https://developers.google.com/games/services/common/concepts/leaderboards) for information on setting up the Google Play Game Services for your application.

For your Unreal Project:

1. In the **Edit** menu in **Unreal Editor**, select **Project Settings** to view the configuration options for your project.

1. On the left, Select the **Platforms: Android** tab. 

1. In the **Google Play Services** section, check the **Enable Google Play Support** option.

1. Enter the App ID for your game in the **Games App ID** field.

1. Enter your Google Play License Key in the **Google Play License Key** field.

1. Add an element to the **Leaderboard Map**.

1. In the **Leaderboard Map** you'll need to enter a **Name** that is only used within your Unreal Project and the **Leaderboard ID** you set up in your Google Play Services.

	All of these values are available in the Google Play Developer Console for your App and Game Services.

[REGION:tip]
Since the **Name** value in the achievement map is only a mapping for the Google Play Services **Leaderboard ID**, and iOS is directly referred to by their **Leaderboard Reference**, and if you are releasing on both Android and iOS platforms, enter the Leaderboard Reference from your iOS Game Center settings as your **Name** so you only have to call one node regardless of platform.

[REGION:note]
If you are planning to release your application on both Android and iOS devices, please see [](Platforms/Mobile/iOS/Leaderboards) for addition information on setting up your leaderboards.
