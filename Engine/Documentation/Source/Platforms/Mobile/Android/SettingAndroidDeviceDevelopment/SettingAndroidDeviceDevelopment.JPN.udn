In the following section we will go over all you need to know to set up your Android device so that it can be used to run your UE4 project.

## Steps

1.  First, connect your Android device to your development PC using a USB cable.

2.  Once plugged into your PC, your device driver software should automatically install, but if not, visit [Android's OEM USB Drivers](http://developer.android.com/tools/extras/oem-usb.html) page to find more driver installation links and additional information.

3.  Open the **Settings** Application on your Android device.

4.  Tap **Developer Options** to open the Developer Options menu.

5.  Scroll down and select **About Phone**. Depending on your Android device, you may have an About Device, About Tablet, or About Shield option instead.

    This may be in a **More** section on newer Android versions.

6.  Tap the **Build Number** 7 times to activate developer mode.

    [/REGION]

7.  After the first few taps, you will see a message stating "You are now # steps away from becoming a developer".

8.  Once developer mode has been activated, you will get a success message displayed on the screen similar to the one below.

12.  Disconnect your Android device from USB and then immediately plug it back in. After the device is recognized by the PC, the following message will appear on your Android device asking you if you want to allow this PC to talk to your device. A message box will ask what you want to use the USB connection to do. Tap the **checkmark box** that says **Always allow from this computer**, and then tap the **OK** button.

## End Result

To verify that everything has been set up correctly, and that your Android device is ready for UE4 development, you can do the following:

1.  First, open a **Windows Command Prompt** by pressing the **Windows + R** keys to open up the **Run** dialog box.

2.  In the **Open** field, type **cmd **and then click the **OK** button to open the Windows Command Prompt.

3.  At the Command Prompt, input **adb devices** and then press the **ENTER** key to display all connected Android devices.

    ![](ADB_Devices.png)

If you do not see your device after you use the `adb devices` command you can try the following:

*   If the device is listed but shows **Unauthorized** next to the name, that indicates that you did not accept your development PC's computer's RSA key fingerprint. 
*   If your device does not show up despite it being plugged in and set up, input the following commands in the following order into the Windows Command Prompt to restart the **Android Debug Bridge** or (ADB) service:
[REGION:MyTableInList] 
| **Property Name** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **ADB kill - server** | This will stop the ADB service. |
| **ADB start - server** | This will start the ADB service. |
[/REGION]  
*   In some cases, a correctly configured Android device might not show up if it is connected as a **Media Device (MTP)**. If this happens, try connecting as **Camera (PTP)** by selecting the Camera (PTP) option in your Use USB to options.

When completed you will now have an Android-based smartphone that is ready for your UE4 project to be deployed to and run on.
