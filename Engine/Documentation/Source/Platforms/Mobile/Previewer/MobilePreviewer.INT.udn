In Unreal Engine 4 (UE4), you can use the **Mobile Previewer** to preview what your scene will look like on different mobile devices directly in the UE4 Editor viewport. When enabling
the different preview rendering levels, the Materials in your scene will be recompiled to best emulate the look and feature set of the renderer preview that you selected. The Mobile
Previewer enables you to switch back and forth between rendering levels seamlessly without having to restart the editor.


## Using the Mobile Previewer

The **Mobile Previewer** enables you to quickly change between different renderers for your current UE4 session so that you can get an idea of what your game will look like on the device(s) that 
you're targeting while allowing you to work in the editor. To learn how to change to a different renderer preview, follow these steps:

[REGION:note]
While you do not need to restart the Editor for the new preview rendering level to take effect, the first time you change to a preview rendering level the editor will need to time to recompile the 
shaders. Subsequent changes to previously used rendering levels should be nearly instantaneous.

1. From the Main Toolbar, select the **Settings** button to expand the listed menu items. Under the **Scalability** section, hover over the **Preview Rendering Level** to expose the different 
rendering levels options you can select from.

1. Hover the mouse over the section rendering level you'd like to preview and then left-mouse click to select it. In this example, **Android Vulkan Preview** was selected.

	You will see the **Changing Preview Rendering Level** progress bar pop-up. Wait for this to finish and recompile shaders.

1. Once a rendering level has been selected, the Materials in the viewport will automatically update to reflect the new rendering method using the Material Qualities enabled or disabled for for 
that target platform. (See the [Platform Material Quality Settings](#platformmaterialqualitysettings) section of this page for more details on how to adjust these further.)

[REGION:note]
The Mobile Previewer is intended to match mobile devices as closely as possible but it may not always be indicative of what your project is going to look like on the target device. 
You should always make sure to fully test your project on your target device and only use the mobile previewer to see if your work is headed in the right direction.

### Using Mobile Previewer in 4.8 or Earlier

In version 4.8 of Unreal Engine, you do not have the ability to change the editor viewport rendering method to simulate mobile rendering. To see what your project could like on 
mobile, you have to launch a Standalone game using the **Enable Mobile Preview** option.

To enable Mobile Preview mode you will need to do the following:

1. From the Main Toolbar, select the arrow that is next to the **Play** button to expose the different play modes. 
1. Select **Mobile Preview** and your project will then be launched in a new window that simulates what your project should look like on a mobile device.

## Enabling High-End Mobile Preview Platforms

For some platforms, like the high-end ones for Android OPENGLES 3.1, Android Vulkan, and iOS Metal, you can choose to enable or disable these individually as a Preview Rendering Level that will populate
the preview list for **High-End Mobile / Metal**. When these target platforms are enabled or disabled, they will be added or removed from the list accordingly. 

Use the steps below to learn how to enable or disable these target platforms from being used with the Mobile Previewer. 

1. Start by opening the **Project Settings** window by going to the file menu > **Edit** > **Window** > **Project Settings**.

1. In the **Project Settings** under the **Platforms** section, select either the **Android** or **iOS** section.

	For **Android OPENGLES 3.1** and **VULKAN** previews, in the **Android** section under **Build**, set the options for **Support OpenGLES 3.1** or **Support Vulkan**.

	For **iOS Metal**, in the **iOS** section under **Rendering**, set the option for **Support Forward Rendering with Metal (A7 and up devices)**.

1. Once any of these have been enabled or disabled you will see the list of supported platforms update in the Preview Rendering Levels list.

## Platform Material Quality Settings

In the **Project Settings** under the **Platforms** category, you can select different platform **Material Quality** sections to enable or disable specific features for the target platform.

## Preview Rendering Level Selections

When you select your Preview Rendering Level, you will have a few options select from. Use the table below to select the option that best fits your target device. 

[REGION:raw]
| Device Target | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [REGION:tablesection] High-End Mobile / Metal [/REGION] ||
| **Default High-End Mobile** | This will emulate the default high-end mobile material quality settings without using any material quality overrides specified in the Project Settings. |
| **Android GLES 3.1** | Provides a preview emulation of supported Android OpenGL ES3.1 quality settings. The Material Quality settings can be set in the **Project Settings** > **Android Material Quality - ES31** section.  |
| **Android Vulkan** | Provides a preview emulation of supported Android Vulkan quality settings. The Material Quality settings can be set in the **Project Settings** > **Android Material Quality - Vulkan** section. |
| **iOS Metal** | Provides a preview emulation of supported iOS Metal quality settings. The Material Quality settings can be set in the **Project Settings** > **iOS Material Quality - Metal** section. |
| [REGION:tablesection] Mobile / HTML5 [/REGION] ||
| **Default Mobile / HTML5** | This will emulate the default mobile material quality settings without using any material quality overrides specified in the **Project Settings**. |
| **Android** | Provides a preview emulation of supported Android OpenGL ES2 quality settings. The Material Quality settings can be set in the **Project Settings** > **Android Material Quality - ES2** section. |
| **iOS ES2** | Provides a preview emulation of supported iOS OpenGL ES2 quality settings. The Material Quality settings can be set in the **Project Settings** > **iOS Material Quality - ES2** section. |
[/REGION]

[REGION:note]
Some of the available Preview Rendering Levels are not visible until you've enabled them as a target platform via the Project Settings, namely, Android OpenGLES 3.1 and Android Vulkan. iOS Metal defaults
to on, however, it will also be removed as an available preview option if its target platform is disabled.
