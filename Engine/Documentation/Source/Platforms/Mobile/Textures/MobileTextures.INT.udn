Since mobile platforms use OpenGL ES2, there are restrictions imposed on textures. Some of the restrictions come into play 
when creating textures:

* A maximum size of 2048 in either dimension. This is the largest size allowed by the PVR compressor.
* Dimensions must both be a power of 2 (i.e. 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024, or 2048).
* You should use square textures whenever possible as they make more efficient use of memory. 

In addition, texture settings need to be set up properly to work on mobile platforms:

* It is recommended that you only use  **TC_Default** or **TC_NormalMap** in the **Compression Settings** as any other setting could cause your Texture to take up more memory than expected on your target device.
* The **sRGB** property should be enabled.
 
## Texture Usage in Materials

Most opaque Materials should only need BaseColor, Roughness, and Normal to come from textures. Specular should not be specified 
and Metallic can be a constant. Given that base set of Material properties, most Materials that only have one layer should use 
the following setup which only requires two textures:

* **Texture 1**
	* BaseColor in RGB
	* Roughness in alpha
	* TC_Default compression
* **Texture 2**
	* Normal map in RGB
	* TC_NormalMap compression

Additional layers will need to use more textures, with the option of only layering in BaseColor + Roughness to avoid multiple normal map texture fetches.

## Per-Device Texture LOD

With the release of Unreal Engine 4.8 you can now specify Texture LOD settings on a per-device basis as opposed to per-platform. 
To set the Texture LOD settings per-device you will need to do the following.

1. From the main Tool Bar open the **Devices Profiles** manager by going to **Windows** > **Developer Tools** and then clicking on **Device Profiles**.

1. From this menu select the device you want to edit and then click on the three dots that are to the left of the device name to open that devices profile.

1. To make a change just click on the property you want to adjust and then input what you want the setting to be.
