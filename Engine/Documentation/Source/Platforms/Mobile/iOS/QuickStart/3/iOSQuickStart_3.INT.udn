If you have previously developed iOS applications on a Mac but want to use Unreal Engine on a Windows PC to develop your iOS game, 
[you can skip this step](Platforms/Mobile/iOS/QuickStart/4) and export your certificate to a `.p12` file from **Keychain** to use with the Unreal iOS Configuration Wizard.

## Steps
To deploy and use your UE4 project on your iOS device you will need special certificates from Apple. Generating a signing certificate for iOS development on Windows is done using a combination of Apple's Developer site and the Unreal iOS Configuration Wizard (iPhonePackager) application that provided with Unreal Engine, and in the following section, we will go over how you do this.

1. First, navigate to your `Engine\Binaries\DotNET\IOS\` directory and run `iPhonePackager.exe`.

1. Since provisioning is project-specific when the iPhonePackager.exe is opened, it will first ask you to locate your project's .uproject file. Once you have located your projects .uproject file, press the **Open** button to open it up.

    [REGION:note]
    This must be done each time you run the iPhonePackager application. However, it will remember the location of the last project you selected.

1. Select the **New User** tab and click the **Create certificate request and a key pair** button.
