## Steps
You must add all of the devices you want to be able to install your UE4 project on during development through the [Apple iOS Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action). Unreal Engine 4 can only launch and install your project to devices associated with your mobile provision profile (created later in this guide).

1. Go to the [iOS Devices](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/device/) page on the Apple iOS Developer site.

1. Click the **Add** (plus sign) button to add a new device.

1. Select **Register Device**, enter a name and the UDID for the device and click **Continue**.

1. Review the information you have entered and click **Register**.

Repeat these steps for all devices you want to be able to launch your game on for testing.

## End Result

When completed you will now be able to launch your UE4 project on any device that has been registered to your Apple developer account.
