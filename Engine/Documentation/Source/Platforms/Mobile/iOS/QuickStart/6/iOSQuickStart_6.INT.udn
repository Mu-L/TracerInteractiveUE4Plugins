## Steps

You must have a provisioning profile in order to install apps onto your iOS devices. These are created and downloaded through the 
[Apple iOS Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/devcenter/ios/index.action). Your provisioning profile includes your signing certificate, 
devices, and an App ID. There are both development provisioning profiles which are used to build and install your game during the development cycle, 
and distribution provisioning profiles which are used when submitting your game to the App Store.


1. Go to the [iOS Provisioning Profiles](https://developer.apple.com/account/ios/profile/profileList.action) page on the Apple iOS Developer site.

1. Click the **Add** (plus sign) button to add a new profile.

1. Under Development, select iOS App Development and click **Continue**.
