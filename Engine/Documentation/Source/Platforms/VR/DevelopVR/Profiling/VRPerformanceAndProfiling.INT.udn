Because of the hardware requirements of virtual reality, as well as the stronger impact poor performance can have on your users' comfort, maintaining good VR project performance is key. Unreal Engine 4 contains
a suite of tools that allow you to view the performance of your project on both the CPU and the GPU. By interpreting those results, and then applying best content and gameplay code practices, you can provide
the best possible experience with your project.
