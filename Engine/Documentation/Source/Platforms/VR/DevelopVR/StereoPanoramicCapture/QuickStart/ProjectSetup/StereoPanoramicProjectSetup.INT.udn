In this section, we will create and then set up a new UE4 project to work out of.

[region:note]
While we will be creating a new blank project for this how-to, the information presented here can be applied to any UE4 project.

## Steps

1. From the **New Project** section of the Unreal Project Browser create a new Blank Blueprint base project with the following options and when completed, press the **Create Project** button to set up and load the new project.

    * Blank Project Template
    * Mobile / Tablet
    * Scalable 3D or 2D
    * No Starter Content

1. Once the project has been loaded go to the top menu bar and then go to **Edit** > **Plugins** to open up the plugins options.

1. Once the editor re-starts open up the console by pressing the backtick (`) on the keyboard and then input **SP.**. If the Stereo Panoramic Movie Plugin has been successfully enabled, you should see a list of commands you can choose from. If you do not see the command list make sure that you enabled and restarted the editor and that you are using Unreal Engine 4.13 or later.

With the Stereo Panoramic Move Plugin now enabled and verified to be working, we will next take a look at how to use the plugin to capture stereo images.
