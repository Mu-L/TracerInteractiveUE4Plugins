[TOC]

On the following page, you will find a detailed description of what options and controls are available for the Stereo Panoramic Capture plugin and what those options do to the image that is output. The options have been broken up into groups based on what those options do. To input a command press the backtick or tilde key (`) to open up the UE4 console and then type **SP.** followed by the command you want to enter.

If you want to know more about any of the settings below, check out the **StereoPanoramaManager.cpp** file for more information.

## Slice Controls

The Slice Control options are for controlling how many horizontal or vertical slices are taken for each image.

[REGION:SimpleTable] 
| Property | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SP.HorizontalAngularIncrement** | 1.0f | The number of degrees per horizontal step. Must be a factor of 360. |
| **SP.VerticalAngularIncrement** | 90.0f | The number of degrees per vertical step. Must be a factor of 180. |
| **SP.CaptureHorizontalFOV** | 90.0f | Horizontal FOV for scene capture component. Must be larger than SP.HorizontalAngularIncrement. |
| **SP.EyeSeparation** | 6.4f | The separation of the stereo cameras. |
[/REGION]


## Atlas Controls

The atlas controls actually control the atlas of shots collected from the slices, which are used to reconstruct the 360 degree image.

[REGION:SimpleTable]   
| Property | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SP.StepCaptureWidth** | 4096 | The final spherical atlas width. |
| **SP.ForceAlpha** | false | Force the alpha value to completely opaque. |
[/REGION]

## Sampling Controls

The Sampling Control options affect how the image is filtered.

[REGION:SimpleTable] 
| Property | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SP.CaptureSlicePixelWidth** | 2048 | Capture Slice Pixel Dimension. |
| **SP.EnableBilerp** | true | 0 - No Filtering 1- Bilinear Filter slice samples. |
| **SP.SuperSamplingMethod** | 1 | 0 - No Supersampling, 1 - Rotated Grid SS. |
[/REGION]

## Debug Controls

The Debug Control options allow you to see and adjust how the images are captured allowing you to easily track down any issues you might run into with the final output image.

[REGION:SimpleTable] 
| Property | Default Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **SP.ConcurrentCaptures** | 30 | The number of scene captures to capture at the same time. |
| **SP.GenerateDebugImages** | 0 | 0 - No Debug Images. 1 - Save out each strip as it is generated. 2 - Save each entire slice. |
| **SP.OutputDir** | This will default to your projects saved folder | The location where your images will be saved to. |
| **SP.ShouldOverrideInitialYaw** | true | Override Initial Camera Yaw. Set to true if you don't want to use PlayerController View-Dir. |
| **SP.ForcedInitialYaw** | 90.0f | Yaw value for initial Camera view direction. Set ShouldOverrideInitialYaw to true to use this value. |
| **SP.FadeStereoToZeroAtSides** | true | Fade stereo effect between left/right eye to zero at 90 degrees. |
[/REGION]

[REGION:note]
Please note that raising or lowering the value of **SP.ConcurrentCaptures** can greatly affect capture times. Setting this too low and you will not be using the optimal number for parallel processing. Setting this too high and you will overwhelm the GPU.

## Pre-set Quality Levels

The Pre-set Quality levels allow you to select from three different pre-defined image quality levels. To use a Pre-Set Quality level press the backtick or tilde key (`) to open up the UE4 console and then type **SP.(Quality Level you want to use)**.

### Preview Quality Level

[REGION:SimpleTable]  
| Property | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| **SP.HorizontalAngularIncrement** | 5 |
| **SP.VerticalAngularIncrement** | 60 |
| **SP.CaptureHorizontalFOV** | 60 |
| **SP.StepCaptureWidth** | 720 |
[/REGION]

### Average Quality Level

[REGION:SimpleTable]   
| Property | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| **SP.HorizontalAngularIncrement** | 2 |
| **SP.VerticalAngularIncrement** | 30 |
| **SP.CaptureHorizontalFOV** | 30 |
| **SP.StepCaptureWidth** | 1440 |
[/REGION]

### Improved Quality Level
  
[REGION:SimpleTable]
| Property | Default Value |
| --- | --- |
| **SP.HorizontalAngularIncrement** | 0.5 |
| **SP.VerticalAngularIncrement** | 22.5 |
|** SP.CaptureHorizontalFOV** | 22.5 |
| **SP.StepCaptureWidth** | 1440 |
