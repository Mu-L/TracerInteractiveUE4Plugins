The Gear VR has Motion Controller will allow you to interact with your UE4 project like never before by enabling users to pick up and interact with objects like they would in the real world.  In the following How - To we will take a look at how you can setup your UE4 projects to work with the Gear VR Motion Controller.

## Steps

1. First, open up the player pawn you want to add Motion Controller support to, in this example, our pawn is called **GearVR_Pawn_MotionController**, and in the **Components** tab, click on the **Add Component** button and then search for **Motion Controller**.

1. Drag the newly added **Motion Controller** on top of the existing **VRCameraRoot** so that it is a child component like the **VRCamera**.

    [region:note]
    By default, the Gear VR Motion Controller Component **Location** should be set to 0,0,0 when added to your Pawn. If for some reason this is not the case, make sure and set the location to 0,0,0.

1. Click on the Add Component button and from the displayed list, select the **Static Mesh** option to add a new Static Mesh component.

1. Select the newly added Player Pawn and in the **Details** panel, make sure to set the **Auto Possess Player** to **Player 0** so that we will use this Pawn when the level is running.

## End Result

When your project launches, put your phone in your Gear VR headset and pick up your Gear VR Motion Controller. Now when you move the motion controller around in the real world, you should see that movement replicated in your UE4 project like in the following video.
