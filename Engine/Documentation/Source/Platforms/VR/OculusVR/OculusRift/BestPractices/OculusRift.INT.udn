[TOC(start:1 end:2)]

The Oculus Rift is a Head Mounted Display (HMD) which allows the user to deeply immerse themselves into the worlds and games they are viewing or playing. The following guide will help to highlight some information that you need to know about when developing content for the Oculus Rift and Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).

## Oculus HMD Target Frame Rate

Below you will find the frame rate that your UE4 project must meet when using an Oculus Rift HMD device. 

| HMD Device  | Target Frame Rate |
| --- | --- |
| **Rift Retail** | 90 FPS|
| **DK2** | 75 FPS|
| **DK1** | 60 FPS|

## Oculus Rift Sanity Check

If for some reason the Oculus HMD is not working first check that the Oculus plug-In is enabled. You can find the Oculus plugin under the **Virtual Reality** section in the [Plug-in](Programming/Plugins) menu.

If the Rift is not working in a Packaged game, make sure that **Start in VR** is checked. **Start In VR** can be found by going to **Project Settings** > **Description** > **Settings**.

## Checking work with the Oculus Rift

The Oculus Rift HMD will not work with any of the UE4 Editor viewports or the default Play In Editor (PIE) session. To view your project on the Rift you will need to use the **VR Preview** option. To access the VR Preview option you will need to do the following inside the UE4 Editor. 

1. On the main Toolbar in the **Play** section, click on the small white triangle that is next to the Play button.

1. From the drop-down menu, select the **VR Preview** option and then put your Rift on to view your project in VR.

	Once you have changed the play mode to the VR Preview option your project will always launch in VR, even when using shortcuts like **ALT + P**.
