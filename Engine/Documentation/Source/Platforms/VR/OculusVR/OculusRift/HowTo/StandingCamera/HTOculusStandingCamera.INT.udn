One of the first things you will need to think about when starting to develop any Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) powered VR experience to be used with the Oculus Rift is deciding whether the experience will be a seated one or a standing one. In the following How - To we will take a look at how to setup your UE4 projects VR camera for a standing Oculus Rift VR experience.

## Steps

Below you will find instructions on setting up a Pawn to work with a standing Oculus Rift experience.

1. First, open up or create a new Pawn Blueprint and then go to the **Component** section of the **Viewport** tab. From there add the following two components with the following names, making sure that the VRCamera is a child of VRCameraRoot:
    
    [REGION:simpletable]
	|Component Name| Value |
    |--------|------------|
    |**Scene**|VRCameraRoot|
    |**Camera**|VRCamera|

    [region:note]
    No matter what VR HMD you are using, this is the Epic recommend way to set up a VR camera as it allows you to offset the position of the camera without having to move the actual camera.

1. Next, open up the Pawn Blueprint if not already open and in the **Event Graph** drag off the **Event Begin Play** node to show the Executable Actions list. In the list search for the **Set Tracking Origin** node and click on it to add it to the Event Graph.

1. The Set Tracking Origin node has two options, **Floor Level** and **Eye Level**. For a standing experience, you will need to keep the **Origin** of the Set Tracking Origin node to the default of **Floor Level**.
