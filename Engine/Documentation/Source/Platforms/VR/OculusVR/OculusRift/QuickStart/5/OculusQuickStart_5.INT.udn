In this section we will cover how you can test to see if your Rift is working with Unreal Engine 4.

1. Open up the Unreal Project Browser and in the **New Project** tab create a new project that has the following settings:

1. Once UE4 has launched, go to the **Main Menu** and change the **Play** option from the default of **Selected Viewport** to **VR Preview**, pressing VR Preview to launch the level.

	[region:note]
	When using the VR preview option and the Rift, the VR preview window will display black and look like it is not updating anytime you launch or re-launch the VR preview window. This is because when the Rift is not placed on your head it disables the display output to help extend the life of the display.
