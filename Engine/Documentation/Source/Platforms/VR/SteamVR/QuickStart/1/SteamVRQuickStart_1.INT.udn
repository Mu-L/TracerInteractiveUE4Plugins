In the following section, we will take a look at how to get SteamVR setup so that it will work with Unreal Engine 4 (UE4).

## Steps

[region:note]
With each SteamVR development kit, Valve has provided [detailed instructions](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamvr/vr_setup.pdf ) that will show you how to correctly set everything up. 
If you have not read this document, please do so before going any further as the following information is not a substitute for the information contained in the document created by Valve.

1. Ensure that the Vive Head Mounted Display (HMD), Steam Controllers, Breakout Box, and Lighthouse Base stations are all unpacked, powered on, connected and setup according to the [instructions](http://media.steampowered.com/apps/steamvr/vr_setup.pdf) provide by Valve.

1. If you have not done so already, make sure to download and install the [Steam Client](http://store.steampowered.com/about/) on your development PC.

1. To install the **SteamVR** tools, use your mouse to hover over the Steam **Library** option and from the menu that is displayed, select the **Tools** option.

    [region:note]
    When SteamVR shows all devices in green (like in the image above) that means everything is working correctly. 
    If a device that shows up in gray then there is a problem with that device.
    SteamVR will tell you what is wrong with a device that is grayed out and also provides possible fixes. To see the fixes,  hover your mouse over a grayed out device.

1. Before you can use SteamVR with UE4, you must setup the SteamVR interaction area. 
To do this, right-click on the SteamVR window and select the **Run Room Setup** and follow the on-screen directions to set up the SteamVR interaction area.
