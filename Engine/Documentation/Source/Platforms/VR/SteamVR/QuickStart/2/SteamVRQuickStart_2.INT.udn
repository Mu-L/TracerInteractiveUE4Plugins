In the following section, we will go over how to set up a new Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) project to work with SteamVR.

## Steps

[region:note]
If you have not done so already, make sure to run the SteamVR **Room Setup** to establish and calibrate the VR tracking area. 
Failing to do this could result in SteamVR and UE4 not working correctly together.

1. Create a new blank Blueprint-base project with hardware set to **Mobile / Tablet**, graphics set to **Scalable 3D or 2D** and **No Starter Content**.

1. When the VR Preview launches, put on your HMD and you should now see the basic level being displayed and have the ability to rotate your head around in any direction when you put the HMD on like in the video below.
