Now that you can view a UE4 project using SteamVR and the HTC Vive, try adding the following items to your project.

* Use the [Migrate Tool](Engine/Content/Browser/UserGuide/Migrate/) to move content from one of the mobile content examples into your project for use.

* Add support for [Motion Controllers](Platforms\VR\DevelopVR\MotionController) so that the user can move objects around in VR just like they would in real life.

* Use the [GPU Profiler](Engine/Performance/GPU/) to help track your projects performance while you are building it.

Here are some additional resources that provide useful information for developing VR projects inside of Unreal Engine 4.
