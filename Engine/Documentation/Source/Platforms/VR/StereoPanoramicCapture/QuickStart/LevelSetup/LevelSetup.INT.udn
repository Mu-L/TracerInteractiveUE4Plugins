In this step, we will go over how to set up a level that will display the stereo screenshots when the level is run.

1. From the **Main Toolbar** go to the **File** option and then from the list that is displayed, select the **New Level** option.

1. When the **New Level** dialogue box shows up, choose the **Empty Level** option to load a new empty level.

1. Click on the link below to download the required Static Mesh that is needed to display the Material. 

    [](SM_PhotoSphere.zip)

	[region:note]
	The Static Mesh you are downloading has had its UV’s setup to work correctly with Material that was created. While you can use any Static Mesh you want, downloading this file will ensure that you will get the correct results.

1. Once the file has downloaded, unzip the file and then import the Static mesh into the Content Browser.

    [region:note]
    If you receive a warning about smoothing groups not being found in the file, you can safely ignore that warning as we do not need smoothing information for this object as it uses an unlit shader.

1. After the **SM_PhotoSphere**  Static Mesh has been imported, drag the **SM_PhotoSphere** from the Content Browser into the level, positioning it so that it's location is a **0,0,0** in the world.

1. Once the SM_PhotoSphere has been positioned in the center of the level, select the MAT_StereoViewer Material in the Content Browser and then drag it to the **Materials** input in the Details panel.

1. Once the Material has been applied, press the **Play in VR** preview button and then put your HMD on to see what the images look like when viewed in stereo. If everything has been set up correctly, you should not be able to tell that the level is being rendered using just two images instead of 3D objects.

        [/PARAMLITERAL]
    [/OBJECT]

	[region:note]
	The black sphere you are seeing is the shadow that is cast from the Static Mesh that is attached to the Default Pawn.  To get rid of this shadow you can either create a new Game Mode and Pawn or when you run the game you can press the player eject button, find the Default Pawn in the World Outliner and under the Static Mesh section, set the Static Mesh to none and the shadow will be gone.

With this simple set up, you can now view any images that you take using the Stereo Panoramic plugin by replacing the left and right eye images with the new images that you created.
