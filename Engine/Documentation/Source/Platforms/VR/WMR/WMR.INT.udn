Unreal Engine 4 now natively supports the Windows Mixed Reality (WMR) platform and headsets, including the HP Mixed Reality and the Samsung Odyssey headsets. 

For complete information on installing and configuring the Windows Mixed Reality platform and headsets, see Microsoft's [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/mixed-reality/enthusiast-guide/before-you-start).

[REGION:warning]
To use Unreal Engine's WMR support, you must be on the **April 2018 Windows 10 update or later**, and have a supported headset.
