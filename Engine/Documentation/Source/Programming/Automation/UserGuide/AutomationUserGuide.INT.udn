The **Automation** tab is part of the **Session (Unreal) Frontend**. It's located here because it enables you to run automation tests on any other devices that are connected to your machine or are on your local network.

There are two ways you can access the frontend suite: 

* **Session Frontend** - Opens the local Editor as an automation worker to run automation on external devices. 
	* Navigate to **Window** > **Developer Tools** > **Session Frontend**
* **Unreal Frontend** - Opens a standalone version of the Frontend that includes the Session Frontend, Device Manager, and Project Launcher. 
	* Navigate to your **[UE4 Root Directory]** > **Engine** > **Binaries** > **Win64** > **UnrealFrontend.exe**


## Enabling Plugins

In the latest versions of Unreal Engine 4, all the Automation Tests have been moved from the Engine Content folder to their plugins that must be enabled before they will be visible in the 
Automation tab.

[REGION:note]
If you're using the standalone Unreal Frontend, all the automation tests will be available without any additional steps to enable it. 
[/REGION]


## User Interface

When you open the Session Frontend, you'll have access to a few tabs, such as the Console, Automation, Screenshot Comparison, and Profiler. For all your automation testing needs, the 
**Automation** tab will house all of the functionality you need with some additional functionality falling under the [Screenshot Comparison](Programming/Automation/ScreenShotComparison) tab 
for rendering functionality comparison.

[REGION:note]
If you do not see anything listed in the Automation tab window, select an active session from the Session Browse on the left. For example, under **This Application** the machine named **RDU-WD** is selected.
[/REGION]

### Session Browser

The **Sessions Browser** enables you to connect to specific instances of the Editor. You will only see the Automation window populate with the available automation tests once a session has been selected.
