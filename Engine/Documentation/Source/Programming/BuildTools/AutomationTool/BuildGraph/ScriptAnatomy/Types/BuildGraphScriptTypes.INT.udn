The following table contains valid data types that can be contained by BuildGraph attributes:

  
| **Type** | **Description** |
| --- | --- |
| **String** | An arbitrary string. |
| **String List** | A list of arbitrary strings separated by semi-colons. |
| **Boolean** | The constant `true` or `false`. |
| **Integer** | An integer constant. |
| **Regex** | A regular expression, using [C#](http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm) syntax. |
| **Name** | A named entity. Any printable character, except `^ < > : " / \ | ? * ;`. Single spaces are allowed (except at the start and end of a name). |
| **Name List** | A list of identifiers separated by semi-colons. |
| **Tag** | A label given to a list of files, beginning with the # character (i.e., `#My Files`). |
| **Tag List** | A list of tags separated by semi-colons. (i.e., `#My Files;#Other Files`). |
| **Target** | A node name, aggregate name, agent name, or tag name. Indicates a sequence of nodes that need to be executed. Note that this overlaps with the meaning of `Target` as it applies to [UnrealBuildTool](Programming/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool) (which refers to a single program being built). |
| **Target list** | A list of target names separated by semi-colons. |
| **File Spec** | A set of file and tag names, separated by semi-colons. Wildcards such as `"..."`, `"_"`, and `"?"` are permitted when referencing files (i.e., `Engine/.../_.bat`). Unless otherwise specified, relative paths are resolved relative to the working root directory. |
| **File Name** | A path to a file. Unless otherwise specified, relative paths are resolved to the working root directory. |
| **Directory Name** | A path to a directory. Unless otherwise specified, relative paths are resolved relative to the working root directory. |
| **Condition** | A [conditional expression](Programming/BuildTools/AutomationTool/BuildGraph/ScriptAnatomy/Conditions). |
