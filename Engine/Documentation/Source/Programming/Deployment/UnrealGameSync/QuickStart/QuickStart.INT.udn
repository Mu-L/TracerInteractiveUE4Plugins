The goal of this guide is to show you the primary workflow of syncing your **Unreal Project** (.uproject) using **UnrealGameSync (UGS)**. After working through this tutorial, you'll know how to open an Unreal Project with UGS, and how to sync from the **Project Overview** and **Changelist Areas** of the application's main menu.

[REGION:note]
**Required Setup:** The following steps assume that your team has distributed and set up UGS on your machine(s).
[/REGION]

## 1 - Opening a Local File

The following steps show you how to open a local Unreal Project file with UGS.

1.  To open a ***.uproject** on your local drive, click the **Open project...** link.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step1_1.png)

1.  When the **Open Project** window opens, UGS enables the **Local File** radio button by default. To select a local file, click the **Browse...** button.

1.  Navigate to and select the ***.uproject** file before clicking **Open**.

1.  To open the Unreal Project with UGS, click the **Ok** button.

## 2 - Opening a Workspace File

The following steps show you how to open a workspace Unreal Project file with UGS.

1.  To open a ***.uproject** file on your local drive, click the **Open project...** link.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step1_1.png)

1.  When the **Open Project** window opens, UGS selects the **Local File** radio button by default. Select the **Workspace **radio button to get started.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step2b_1.png)

1.  The first field that needs to be populated is the Workspace's name. If you already have a Workspace to point UGS to, click the** Browse...** button next to the **Name:** field.

	If you need to create new Workspace, click the **New...** button to set up a New Workspace.

	[/REGION]

1.  When the **Select Workspace** menu opens, it will show you a list of Workspaces that you can choose from. Go ahead and select a **Workspace** (1) and click the **Ok** button (2).  
    ![](UGSQS_Step2b_3.png "UGSQS_Step2b_3.png")

1.  Now, click the **Browse...** button next to the **Path:** field.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step2b_4.png "UGSQS_Step2b_4.png")

1.  With the **Select Project** menu open, expand the Workspace tree, select the ***.uproject** file (1), and click the **Ok** button (2).

1.  Now that you've specified the **Workspace ****Name** and **Path**, you're ready to open the Unreal Project with UGS by clicking the **Ok** button.

## 3 - Syncing from the Changelist Area

Now that you’ve opened a project with UGS, you’ll want to perform a common task with UGS, syncing from the **Changelist Area**.
[REGION:note]
Make sure that you’ve logged into **Perforce** before proceeding with the following steps.
[/REGION]

1.  Now that you’ve opened your project with UGS, locate the **Changelist Area** in the **Main Menu**.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step3_1-1.png "UGSQS_Step3_1-1.png")

1.  Locate the change that you’re using, it will have an **arrow icon** next to it.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step3_2-1.png "UGSQS_Step3_2-1.png")

1.  To update to another change that was committed to the project’s stream, double click on the other change while inside of the **Changelist Area**.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step3_3-1.png "UGSQS_Step3_3-1.png")

When the sync finishes, UGS updates the **Output Log (3)**, the **Changelist Area (2)**, and the **Project Overview Area (1)**, which is where you’ll sync your project from in the next step.

## 4 - Syncing from the Project Overview Area

Now that you’ve performed a sync from the **Changelist Area**, having already opened the project with UGS, you’ll want to perform another common task with UGS, syncing from the **Project Overview Area**.  

1.  First, locate the **Project Overview Area** in the **Main Menu**.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step4_1.png "UGSQS_Step4_1.png")

1.  Click the **down arrow** button next to the **Sync Now - To...** button link to open the shortcut menu.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step4_2.png "UGSQS_Step4_2.png")

1.  Now, select the **Latest Change** option.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step4_3.png "UGSQS_Step4_3.png")

    [REGION:note]
    To learn more about navigating the interface, options, and menus built into UGS, check out the [UGS Reference](Programming/Deployment/UnrealGameSync/Reference) Guide.
    [/REGION]

At the end of the sync, UGS will notify you that you’ve successfully updated to the latest **Change**.   

![](UGSQS_Step4_5.png "UGSQS_Step4_5.png")

You’ve now reached the end of this guide, where you learned how to open a project and how to sync it from the **Changelist** and **Project Overview Areas** of the user interface. If you want to continue learning more about UGS on your own, including how to deploy a binary version of your project or how to navigate the interface with all of its menus and options, check out the next section of this guide.  

## 5 - On Your Own!

Now that you’ve opened your project, having performed a couple of common sync methods with UGS, try out the following:  

*   Enable the **Build** and **Run** check boxes, which are found at the bottom of the UGS main menu to sync, build, and run your Unreal project.  
    ![](UGSQS_Step4_OYO1.png "UGSQS_Step4_OYO1.png")

*   If you’re a developer looking to make use of the precompiled binaries feature for Creators who don’t need to compile from source, read through the [UGS Reference](Programming/Deployment/UnrealGameSync/Reference) guide for more information on how to set up your build system to periodically submit a zip file containing Editor binaries to Perforce, enabling UGS to extract it to your creative's workspace.
