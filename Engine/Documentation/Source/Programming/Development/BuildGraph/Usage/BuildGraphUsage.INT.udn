[TOC(start:1 end:3)]

BuildGraph is implemented as part of AutomationTool, which you can run directly from the Unreal Engine 4 solution on Windows, 
or via the `Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.bat` batch file from the command line. On Mac or Linux, it can be run with the 
`Engine/Build/BatchFiles/RunUAT.sh` shell script. If you'd like to get an idea of how to use BuildGraph from the command line, 
we've written sample usage commands for your reference.

## Showing Options & Nodes

To show all of the nodes and options available in a BuildGraph script:

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine/Build/Graph/Examples/AllExamples -ListOnly

## Setting an Option

To set an option defined in the script:

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine/Build/Graph/Examples/Properties.xml -ListOnly -Set:CommandLineProperty=ABCDEF

## Seeing Node Execution

To see what nodes will be executed for a target:

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine\Build\Graph\Examples\AllExamples.xml -Target="All Examples" -ListOnly

## Cleaning Previous Builds

To clean any previous builds and execute a specific target:

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine\Build\Graph\Examples\AllExamples.xml -Target="Property Examples" -Clean

## Writing out an XML Schema

To write out an XML schema containing all registered tasks:

	BuildGraph -Schema=Engine\Build\Graph\Schema.xsd

## Generating a Preprocessed Script

To output a preprocessed version of your script (useful for debugging):

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine\Build\Graph\Examples\AllExamples.xml -Target="All Examples" -ListOnly -Preprocess=D:\Preprocessed.xml

## Exporting a Preprocessed Graph to JSON

To export a preprocessed graph to JSON (for dynamic configuration on build systems):

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine\Build\Graph\Examples\AllExamples.xml -Target="All Examples" -Export=D:\ExportedGraph.json

## Executing a Single Node

To execute a single node on a build system (while transferring intermediates to and from shared storage):

	BuildGraph -Script=Engine\Build\Graph\Examples\AllExamples.xml -Target="All Examples" -Clean -SingleNode=”Manipulate Some Files” -SharedStorage=P:\Network-Share\Unique-Job-12345\
