	Code files can be created through Visual Studio and added to the game project through the **Solution Explorer** 
	in the usual manner. You can also add code files to the appropriate folders outside of Visual Studio and rebuild 
	the solution and project files automatically. This makes it easy to add lots of files quickly through the operating system UI, and also makes working on teams 
	easier as the solution and project files do not need to be synced between members of the team. Each person can 
	just sync the code files and rebuild the project files locally.

**If your project is inside the UE4 root directory:**

1. Run the GenerateProjectFiles.bat batch file located in the root `UE4` directory.
1. Open the UE4.sln Visual Studio solution located in the root `UE4` directory.

There are advanced options available for [](Programming/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool/ProjectFilesForIDEs), which can be used to generate project files for shipping (or additional platforms).

[REGION:note]
For advanced project file generation options for projects outside the UE4 root directory, edit the RegisterShellCommands.bat batch file. The Generate Visual Studio projects (all platforms) entry
shows an example of an additional menu entry, in this case with the `-AllPlatforms` flag. The [available options](Programming/BuildTools/UnrealBuildTool/ProjectFilesForIDEs) are the same as for the main GenerateProjectFiles.bat file.
