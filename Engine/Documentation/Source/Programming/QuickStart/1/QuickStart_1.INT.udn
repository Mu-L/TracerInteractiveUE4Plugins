1. Open **Unreal Engine** from the Launcher. The [](Engine/Basics/Projects/Browser) will appear.

1. Click on the **New Project** tab and then select the **C++** tab. From there, select **Basic Code** so we have a clean starting point, and make sure **With Starter Content** is set. We'll need to enter a project name, so we'll use "QuickStart". We can now click **Create Project** and get started.

The **Unreal Editor** will now open our new project. **Visual Studio** will also open and load the solution file that our project has created.
