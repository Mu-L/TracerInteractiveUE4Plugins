Using what you have learned, try to do the following:

* Add a [Particle System Component](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems) to your FloatingActor. Some pre-built Particle Systems are already included in your project.
* Use **Unreal Engine's** [UProperty](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Properties) macro to expose a variable for the magnitude of your FloatingActor's movement, instead of using a hardcoded value. You might want to check the [%Programming/Tutorials/VariablesTimersEvents:title%](Programming/Tutorials/VariablesTimersEvents) tutorial for help on this topic.
* Add periodic motion on the X and/or Y axis, and multiply the `DeltaTime` value by a number between 0.6 and 1.4, so your FloatingActor appears to float around freely. This can look great for powerups!

As for the specifics covered in this tutorial:

* For more information on Actors, see the [Actor](API:AActor) manual page.
