The Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) Plugin system enables anyone to add a wide range of new functionality without the need to recompile and distribute the entire engine. In the following How - To we will recreate the Lens Distortion global shader plugin to demonstrate how you would go about implementing a global shader that is controllable via Blueprints.

For this example, we will be re-creating the existing Lens Distortion plugin that can be found in **Engine\Plugins\Compositing\LensDistortion** to a new Plugin called **Foo** to demonstrate how you would implement this workflow.
