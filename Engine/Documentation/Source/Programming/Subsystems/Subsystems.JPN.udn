Subsystems in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) are automatically instanced classes with managed lifetimes. These classes provide easy to use extension points, where the programmers can get Blueprint and Python exposure right away, while avoiding the complexity of modifying or overriding engine classes.

Currently supported subsystems lifetimes include:

*   Engine (inherit from `UEngineSubsystem` class)
*   Editor (inherit from `UEditorSubsystem` class)
*   GameInstance (inherit from `UGameInstanceSubsystem` class)
*   LocalPlayer (inherit from `ULocalPlayerSubsystem` class)

For example, if you create a class that derives from this base class:

    class UMyGamesSubsystem : public UGameInstanceSubsystem

This results in the following:

1.  After `UGameInstance` is created, an instance called `UMyGamesSubsystem` is also created.
1.  When `UGameInstance` initializes, `Initialize()` will be called on the subsystem.
1.  When `UGameInstance` is shut down, `Deinitialize()` will be called on the subsystem.
1.  At this point the reference to the subsystem will be dropped, and if there are no other references to it, it is garbage collected.

## Reasons to Use Subsystems

There are several reasons to use programming subsystems.

*   Subsystems save programming time.
*   Subsystems help you avoid overriding engine classes (or from adding more API on an already busy class).
*   Subsystems allow access to Blueprints through user friendly typed nodes.
*   Subsystems allow access to Python scripts for editor scripting, or for writing test code.
*   Subsystems provide modularity and consistency in the codebase.

Subsystems are particularly useful when creating plugins. You don’t need to have instructions about the code needed to make the plugin work. The user can just add the plugin to the game, and you know exactly when the plugin will be instanced and initialized. As a result, you can focus on how to use the API and functionality provided in UE4.

## Accessing Subsystems through Blueprints

Subsystems are automatically exposed to Blueprints, with smart nodes that understand context, and that don't require casting. You are in control of what API is available to Blueprints with the standard `UFUNCTION()` markup and rules.

If you right-click in a Blueprint graph to display the context menu, and search for “subsystems” you see something similar to the image below. There are categories for each major type, and individual entries for each specific subsystem.

If you add the nodes from above, you get results like the following.

## Accessing Subsystems with Python

If you are using Python, you can use built-in accessors to access subsystems, as shown in the example below.

    my_engine_subsystem = unreal.get_engine_subsystem(unreal.MyEngineSubsystem)
    my_editor_subsystem = unreal.get_editor_subsystem(unreal.MyEditorSubsystem)

[REGION:note]
Python is currently an experimental feature.

## Subsystem Lifetimes in Detail

### Engine Subsystems

    class UMyEngineSubsystem : public UEngineSubsystem { ... };

When the Engine Subsystem's module loads, the subsystem will `Initialize()` after the module's `Startup()` function has returned. The subsystem will `Deinitialize()` after the module's `Shutdown()` function has returned.

These subsystems are accessed through GEngine as shown below.

    UMyEngineSubsystem MySubsystem = GEngine->GetEngineSubsystem<UMyEngineSubsystem>();

### Editor Subsystems

    class UMyEditorSubsystem : public UEditorSubsystem { ... };

When the Editor Subsystem's module loads, the subsystem will `Initialize()` after the module's `Startup()` function has returned. The subsystem will `Deinitialize()` after the module's `Shutdown()` function has returned.

These subsystems are accessed through GEditor as shown below.

    UMyEditorSubsystem MySubsystem = GEditor->GetEditorSubsystem<UMyEditorSubsystem>();

### GameInstance Subsystems

    class UMyGameSubsystem : public UGameInstanceSubsystem { ... };

These subsystems can be accessed through UGameInstance as shown below.

    UGameInstance* GameInstance = ...;
    UMyGameSubsystem* MySubsystem = GameInstance->GetSubsystem<UMyGameSubsystem>();

### LocalPlayer Subsystems

    class UMyPlayerSubsystem : public ULocalPlayerSubsystem { ... };

These subsystems can be accessed through ULocalPlayer as shown below.

    ULocalPlayer* LocalPlayer = ...;
    UMyPlayerSubsystem * MySubsystem = LocalPlayer->GetSubsystem<UMyPlayerSubsystem>();

## Subsystems Example

Here is our example. We want to add a stats system to the game, in order to track the amount of resources that have been gathered.

We could derive from `UGameInstance`,and make `UMyGamesGameInstance`, then add the `IncrementResourceStat()` function to it. However, we know that eventually, the team will want to add other stats as well as stat aggregators and saving/loading of stats, and so on. Therefore, you decide to put all of that in a class, such as `UMyGamesStatsSubsystem`.

Again, we could make `UMyGamesGameInstance` and add a member of our `UMyGamesStatsSubsystem` type. Then we can add an accessor to it, and hook up the Initialize and Deinitialize functions. However, there are a couple of problems with this.

*   There isn’t a game-specific derivative of `UGameInstance`.
*   `UMyGamesGameInstance` exists, but it already has a large number of functions, and it is less optimal to add more to it.

There are plenty of good reasons to derive from `UGameInstance` in a sufficiently complicated game. However, when you have subsystems, you don’t need to use it. Best of all, using a subsystem requires less coding than the alternatives.

So, the code we finally use is shown in the example below.

    UCLASS()
    class UMyGamesStatsSubsystem : public UGameInstanceSubsystem
    {
        GENERATED_BODY()
    public:
        // Begin USubsystem
        virtual void Initialize(FSubsystemCollectionBase& Collection) override;
        virtual void Deinitialize() override;
        // End USubsystem
    
        void IncrementResourceStat();
    private:
        // All my variables
    };
