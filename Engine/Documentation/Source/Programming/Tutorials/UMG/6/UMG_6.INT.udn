Using what you have learned, try to do the following:

* Have multiple menus open at the same time.
* Slide or fade **Widgets** onto the screen instead of just having them appear.
* Look into the different sound, style, and color properties that Widgets support.
* Set variables in your **GameMode** such as difficulty level, character class, and so on from within menus.
* Create an in-game menu that pops up and pauses the game when the player presses a key, then resumes gameplay when it is closed.
* Link any functionality you've built or learned from a previous tutorial to a menu built in **Unreal Motion Graphics** (UMG).

As for the specifics covered in this tutorial:

* To learn about designing gameplay screens in UMG and using the many Widgets already available, read the [%Engine/UMG/UserGuide:title%](Engine/UMG/UserGuide) or the [%Engine/UMG/UserGuide/WidgetTypeReference:title%](Engine/UMG/UserGuide/WidgetTypeReference) page.
* For more information about exposing variables and functions, and about using **Timers** and **Events** in your menu, try the [%Programming/Tutorials/VariablesTimersEvents:title%](Programming/Tutorials/VariablesTimersEvents) page.
* For further tutorials, see the [%Programming/Tutorials:title%](Programming/Tutorials) page.
