Using what you have learned, try to do the following:

* Create an **Actor** that moves or rotates to a target transform when an **Event** is run. This could be used as a moving platform or door in a game. Make the Event start a **Timer** that will trigger a second Event which moves the Actor back to its original location. Use exposed variables (that is, exposed through `UPROPERTY`) instead of hard-coded values wherever appropriate.
* Make a lit torch that burns out (perhaps by deactivating a fiery **Particle System Component**) by using a Timer handle and a few custom Events. For example, an AddFuel Event could extend the burning time of the torch. A DouseWithWater Event could shut it off immediately and prevent AddFuel from working in the future. Both of these features can be written without using a **Tick**, simply by modifying a running Timer through its handle.

As for the specifics covered in this tutorial:

* For more information about Timers, try the [%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Timers:title%](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Timers) page.
* For a complete reference using the `UPROPERTY` tag with variables in your classes or structs, look at the [%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Properties:title%](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Properties) page.
* To learn more about `UFUNCTIONS` and Event creation, check the [%Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Functions:title%](Programming/UnrealArchitecture/Reference/Functions) page.
