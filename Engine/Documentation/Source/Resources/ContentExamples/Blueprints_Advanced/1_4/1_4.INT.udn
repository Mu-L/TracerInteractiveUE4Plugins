The **BP_Spotlight** Blueprint is an example of a Blueprint used to create a customizable Actor that can be re-used in multiple situations in the creation of a game. It combines a variety of components into one Actor that is easy to place, and uses the Construction Script to allow users to tweak a number of variables.



## Components List

The Blueprint contains three Static Mesh Components: A base that attaches it to a wall, the spotlight itself, and a hinge that connects the two together. The spotlight is attached to a socket within the hinge, while the hinge is attached to a socket within the base. Sockets, which can be created and positioned in the [](Engine/Content\Types\StaticMeshes\Editor), are a quick and easy way of attaching Static Meshes together without the need to manually type in offsets and rotation values in a Blueprint.

The **Light color** variable not only changes the color of the **Spotlight** SpotLightComponent, but is also used to change vector parameters in Material Instances applied to the **Spotlight mesh** and **Light beam mesh** StaticMeshComponents. These Material Instances are created and applied to the StaticMeshComponents in the ConstructionScript, so each instance of the Blueprint will have its own unique Dynamic Material Instances.
