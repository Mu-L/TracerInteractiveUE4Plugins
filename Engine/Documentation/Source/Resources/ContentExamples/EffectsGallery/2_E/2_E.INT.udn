The **Ribbon TypeData** allows you to create trails, which are very useful in all kinds of projectile-based effects. To make them work, you generally need at least 2 particle Emitters:

* One particle Emitter that emits the source particles (from which the ribbons will spawn) - note that these cannot be GPU particles.
* One particle Emitter that has a Ribbon TypeData module and a Source module (located in the **Trail** group) to define which Emitter will be used as the source.
