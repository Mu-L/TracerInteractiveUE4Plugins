Particles using lit Materials are now affected by all lights in a very realistic way. There is no specific set-up required, just tweak the translucency settings in the Material properties to get the desired result. 

[REGION:warning]
Lit particles use more complex shaders, and may affect performance significantly more than unlit ones; use them wisely!
