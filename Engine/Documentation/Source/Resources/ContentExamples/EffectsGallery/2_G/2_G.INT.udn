Another fantastic and highly useful particle feature in the Unreal Engine is the ability for CPU particles to emit light. By adding a **Light** module to your Emitter, particles from the Emitter can also spawn a dynamic light. You can use the module's properties to control the intensity of the light, the radius, etc.

[REGION:warning]
Although you have the ability to control the percentage of particles that create their own lights (meaning you could have, say, only 50% of the particles actually create a light), this effect can get very expensive very fast. It is not uncommon to have a separate (duplicate) emitter that spawns a lot less particles and use the Light module on that one.
