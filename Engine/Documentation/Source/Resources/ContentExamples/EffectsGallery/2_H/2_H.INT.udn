The **Beam TypeData** allows you to create an effect that connects two points - you can either specify the Source and the Target point, or have them as Actors, or other Emitters. It is used often as a bullet trail effect in shooter type games. In this case, we use it as an electric arc, with the help of the **Noise** module, inside the **Beam** group.
