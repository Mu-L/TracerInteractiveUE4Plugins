There are three examples provided inside the **Landscape** Content Example map which showcase how mountains, hills, and valleys can be created using the **Landscape** tools. The second and third examples demonstrate the use of two additional tools, the **Spline** tool (used to create pathways) and the **Foliage** tool (used to quickly scatter and place Static Meshes like trees).
