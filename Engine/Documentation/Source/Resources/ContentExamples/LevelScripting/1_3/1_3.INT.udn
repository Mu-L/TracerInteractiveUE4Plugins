In this example, when the player walks into a box trigger, 8 coin pickups are spawned, each of which contains a dispatch function for when it is collected by the player. In order to open the next set of doors, the player must collect all 8 coins.

In this case, because the coin Blueprints are spawned during gameplay, they cannot be referenced in level script in the same way the button Blueprint was. Furthermore, the script needs to know when every coin has been collected, which could get messy with a lot of events. Instead, each coin that spawns has its dispatch function bound to a single custom event. This way, when the coin Blueprints are collected, they call the dispatch function and trigger the custom event instead. The script counts how many times the event has fired off until it matches the number of coins that were spawned.

Binding multiple functions to a custom event is useful for a lot of typical gameplay scenarios, such as spawning a group of enemies and then triggering something when all enemies have been killed. In that example, you might bind each spawned enemy to a single 'OnEndPlay' event, which would fire every time one of the enemies was destroyed.

## Coins Setup

The coins in this example are also used in [Example 2.5 of the Blueprints_Advanced level](Resources\ContentExamples\Blueprints_Advanced\2_5).
