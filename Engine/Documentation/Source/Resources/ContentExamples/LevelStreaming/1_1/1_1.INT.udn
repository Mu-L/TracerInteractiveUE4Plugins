Description:An overview of the Level Streaming example level, example 1.1: Persistent Level

The map you open with File Menu in the editor will be you Persistent Level. The Persistent Level cannot be streamed out. Once loaded, it is like a management layer, but the streaming level does not have any limitations for content. You can add whatever you want but keep in mind it will be always loaded.

To add a Streaming Level to you Persistent Level, you have to open the **WINDOW->LEVELS** window **RIGHT-CLICK->ADD LEVEL** gives you several options to add a new level. You can add existing levels or new one or even combine existing levels. It also lets you choose a streaming method but this can also be changed later
