A **Spot Light** emits light from a single point in a cone shape. Users are given two cones to shape the light - the **Inner Cone Angle** and **Outer Cone Angle**. Within the Inner Cone Angle, the light achieves full brightness. As you go from the extent of the inner radius to the extents of the Outer Cone Angle, a falloff takes place, creating a penumbra, or softening around the Spot Light's disc of illumination.

In the image above, we can see that the Spot Light has a very narrow Inner Cone Angle and a much wider Outer Cone Angle. These are defined in the **Details** panel when the light is selected.
