This example shows the effect of **Min Roughness** on a light's reflection. Min Roughness is available in the Light category of the **Details** panel, though you will have to expand the category (click the small white triangle) to see it.

Min Roughness is a way to blur out a highlight that you feel is too sharp. Generally, it is a good idea to use the Roughness value or texture of the Material itself rather than setting Min Roughness on a light, but it can be useful on the occasional stray light that has too sharp of a highlight.
