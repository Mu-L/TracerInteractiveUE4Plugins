The second most important setting to define your Material.

| Shading Model | Description |
| ---- | ----- |
| **Default Lit** | The most commonly used setting. It will reflect light in the standard way. |
| **Unlit** |  This will reflect no light at all. BaseColor will always be black. This often used for VFX or **Light Functions**. |
| **SubSurface** | This is a fast rendering simulation of **SubSurface** effects. This shading model works best on objects with a dynamic shadow as it changes the shadowing of the object. Lastly, you can use it on a static object with baked lighting, but the effect will get lost. Best used for character skin or foliage. |
