**Domains** define the overall usage of a material. Most shaders will be **Surface** however, if a shader needed to be used as a decal, light function or post process, it has to belong to those Domains.

| Domain | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| **Surface**         | Is the default and is used for any kind geometry (static, skeletal, landscape, etc...). |
| **Deferred Decals** | If the material is to be used by Decal Actor, it needs to be set to this or it will not work. |
| **Light Function**  | Used by materials applied to lights as LightFunctions. |
| **PostProcess**     | If the material is used as Blendable Material in a PostProcessing chain. |
| **User Interface**     | This material will be used for UMG or Slate UI |
