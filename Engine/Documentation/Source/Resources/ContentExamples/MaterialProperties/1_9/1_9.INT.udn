We learned earlier that the **Masked BlendMode** only has pixels that are completely opaque or completely transparent. You can use a grayscale texture or a single channel from a texture to use as a mask. **Clip Value** lets you set a threshold when the pixel will be opaque or transparent. For textures that have thin sections, those areas will disappear in the distance as the mipmap forces the white out of the image or channel, adjusting Clip Value will allow you to adjust when that occurs.
