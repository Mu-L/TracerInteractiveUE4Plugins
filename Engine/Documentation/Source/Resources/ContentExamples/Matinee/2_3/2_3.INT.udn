Description:An overview of the Matinee example level, example 2.3: Skeletal Group

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]



This Group has two default tracks for Movement and Anim.

Anim lets you add entire Animation as a single key. The blue area displays the duration of the animation. Right clicking the key gives you a few options to modify looping and start/end offset but the animation itself can't be changed.
