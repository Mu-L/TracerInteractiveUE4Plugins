Description:An overview of the Matinee example level, example 2.4: Camera Group

[TOC(start:2 end:2)]


If you create a NEW CAMERA GROUP instead of an Empty group it will create a Camera actor with Movement and FOVAngle Tracks. Selecting the Group will show a Picture in Picture view of the Camera. Clicking the little camera icon on the Group tab will make you view port the camera. Every time you click this button on a Group the viewport rotation and position will be snapped to the Groups Actor. That means you can update keys by simply changing the viewport.
