The **Mouse Interface** map in Content Examples demonstrates how to utilize mouse or touch inputs in your games. The level, which is pretty simple in terms of play and execution, consists of an array of spheres with a cube that tracks back and forth behind them.

Interaction can be broken down as follows:

* Hovering the mouse over any of the spheres will change its Material - this demonstrates hover (mouse-over) functionality.
* Clicking and dragging on a sphere will cause it to follow the cursor, allowing spheres to be moved around the level. This is also true of touch events from a mobile device.
* Clicking on the box in the background plays and stops a Matinee sequence, which causes the box to move back and forth behind the spheres.
