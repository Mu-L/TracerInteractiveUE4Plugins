The **Navmesh** map in Content Example provides three examples of how to generate and use a **NavMesh** to enable **Pawns** the ability to pathfind their way through obstacles, over ramps or to jump off ledges. While in the editor, and with a **NavMeshBoundsVolume** placed in the level, pressing the **P** key will show/hide the area that the NavMesh covers. The final example in this map shows how the coverage area of a NavMesh is automatically updated when moving **Actors** around in the level (this can be disabled via the **Editor Settings** under **Level Editor/Miscellaneous** and unchecking the **Update Navigation Automatically** checkbox).
