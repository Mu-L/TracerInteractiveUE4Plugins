**SkeletalMeshes** can only be created with external software like 3D Studio Max or Maya; however, their collision is setup in Unreal Editor. When importing, a Physics Asset can be automatically created if **Create Physics Asset** is checked, but the asset created will be an estimation based on the joints and skin weights applied to those joints, so some editing is necessary by using the **Physics Asset Tool** or **PhAT**.
