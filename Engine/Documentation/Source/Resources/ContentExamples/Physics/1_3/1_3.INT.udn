Using a **Radial Force Actor**, you can apply a **Constant Force** (listed as _Force Strength_ in the editor) or an **Impulse**. Impulses need to be fired from a **Blueprint**, and apply their entire force in only one frame, as compared to every frame from a Constant Force. In the content example, only a Constant Force is being applied.

_This force is applied to everything that simulates physics._
