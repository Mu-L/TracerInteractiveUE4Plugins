**Physics Thrusters** are a special physics Actor you can place in the editor and then parent to a physically simulating object, making said object receive the force from the thruster. The thrust propels the Physics Thruster in its **Negative X** direction, or looking at it another way, the **Positive X** axis of the thruster is the "exhaust of a jet engine."

Physics Thrusters can be found in the **Modes** panel, in the **Place Mode** section _All Classes_.
