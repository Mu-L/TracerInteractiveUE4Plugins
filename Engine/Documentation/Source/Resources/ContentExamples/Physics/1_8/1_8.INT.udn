A constraint can be made to break once a certain amount of angular or linear force has been applied to the constraint through its constrained objects. An **Angular Force** would be considered like snapping a twig or a torsion force. A **Linear Force** is a "pulling" force along the "length" of the constraint, such as applying too much weight to a crane's lift line.
