The Content Examples provided in the **PostProcessing** map illustrate how to add screen effects inside and outside of a Post Processing Volume. By adjusting the properties of a Post Processing Volume you can achieve effects like lens flares, screen tinting or blurring and many others as well as define how volumes interact with one another or a player.

## PostProcessing Map

![](PostProcessing_Map.png)(w:640)

Listed below are the examples provided inside the **PostProcessing** map:

| Example | What is Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **[1.1 Default Settings](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_1)** | The default settings of a Post Process Volume (also the settings used when a camera is not within a Post Process Volume). |
| **[1.2 Film](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_2)** | Film allows you to adjust the color of your scenes. |
| **[1.3 SceneColor](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_3)** | Scene Color applies effects, instead of the color shifts seen in the Film section, to your scene (e.g. Vignette, Scene Fringe, and Tone Mapping effects are shown). |
| **[1.4 Bloom](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_4)** | Bloom simulates the effects the eye perceives when viewing objects that appear very bright. |
| **[1.5 Ambient Cubemap](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_5)** | The Ambient Cubemap lights the scene from a provided image. |
| **[1.6 AutoExposure](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_6)** | Shows how to simulate the effect of the human eye adjusting to a bright environment when coming from a dark environment or vice versa with Auto Exposure.|
| **[1.7 Lens Flares](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_7)** | Lens Flare simulates the scattering of light when viewing bright objects through imperfections found in camera lenses. |
| **[1.8 Ambient Occlusion](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_8)** | An effect that approximates the attenuation of light due to occlusion. Best used as a subtle effect that darkens corners or crevices to make them appear more natural.|
| **[1.9 Screenspace Reflection](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_9)** | Alters the appearance of objects in reflections where the Intensity, Quality, or Max Roughness can be set.  |
| **[1.10 Global Illumination](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_10)** | How to affect the indirect lighting contribution coming from Lightmass in order to alter a scene's brightness, tint, or color. |
| **[1.11 Depth Of Field](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_11)** | Applying a blur effect to a scene based on distance in front or behind a focal point with Depth of Field. |
| **[1.12 Motion Blur](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_12)** | Generating a Motion Blur which blurs objects based on its motion. |
| **[1.13 Screen Percentage](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_13)** | Through Screen Percentage, a scene is rendered at a lower resolution and then scaled up. The Screen Percentage value represents a percentage of the overall resolution of the scene. |
| **[1.14 AA Method](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_14)** | Demonstrates Anti-Aliasing (or AA) which improves image quality by smoothing out the edges that appear jagged on screen. |
| **[1.15 Blendables](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_15)** | Blendables are, in short, overlays that can be applied to the screen (e.g. screen warping or coloring). |
| **[1.16 Priorities](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_16)** | Allows you to control which Post Process Volumes will override one another if they are overlapping. |
| **[1.17 Blend Radius and Weight](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_17)** | Used to change the transition from one Post Process Volume to another over a distance (e.g. blend scene tint or color based on distance to an object). |
| **[1.18 Unbound](Resources\ContentExamples\PostProcessing\1_18)** | This allows you to create a global Post Process effect without being constrained to being inside an actual volume (e.g. the effects are applied where ever you are in the world). |
