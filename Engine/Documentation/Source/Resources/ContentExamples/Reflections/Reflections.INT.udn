The **Reflections** Content Example map provides examples on how to adjust the way reflections appear within your levels by using a **Reflection Capture** Actor (which projects a reflection within the Actor's effect volume or radius). 
Examples are also shown on how the Roughness, Metallic, and Specular properties of a Material can be used to produce different reflection results. 

In addition to tweaking reflection settings, the use of both a **Box Reflection** Actor and the more commonly used Sphere Reflection Actor are shown with sample effects that can be achieved.
Lastly, Scene Capture methods are demonstrated which can be used to capture a fully dynamic cube map or capture an image of the scene on every frame. 


## Reflections Map

Listed below are the examples provided inside the Reflections map:

| Example | What is Demonstrated |
| ------- | ------------ |
| **[1.1 Reflections Metallic Materials](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_1)** | Metallic Materials reflecting objects based on the Metallic and Roughness properties (increasing Metallic property results in more chrome like appearance). |
| **[1.2 Reflections Non-Metallic Materials](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_2)** | Non-metallic Materials (0.0 for the Metallic property) reflecting objects based on the Roughness and Specular values of the Material. |
| **[1.3 Box Reflection Capture Actor (Static)](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_3)** | Demonstrates reflection using the Box Reflection Capture Actor which is good for use with interiors that have a box shape. |
| **[1.4 Sphere Reflection Capture Actor (Static)](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_4)** | The more commonly used Sphere Reflection Capture Actor used to reflect the environment, which blends better and is more flexible than the Box Reflection Capture. |
| **[1.5 Screenspace Reflections (Dynamic)](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_5)** | Screenspace Reflections are a dynamic Post Process effect that can only reflect what is on screen. |
| **[1.6 Scene Capture Cube (Dynamic)](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_6)** | Scene Capture Cubes capture a fully dynamic cube map from their location on every frame (these are expensive performance wise and should only be used when absolutely required to achieve a given effect). |
| **[1.7 Scene Capture 2D (Dynamic)](Resources\ContentExamples\Reflections\1_7)** | Scene Capture 2D captures an image of the scene on every frame and projects the image in a Material (they work more like a TV screen receiving an image from a camera and are most commonly used for security camera effects). |
