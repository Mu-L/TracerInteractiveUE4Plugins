The Particle Effects Example shows off a variety of particle systems that demonstrate various environmental and elemental effects. The goal of these examples is to create a variety of believably realistic visual effects, focusing on the use of [GPU Sprite](Engine/Rendering/ParticleSystems\Reference\TypeData\GPUSprites) particles and their features.

## Scene Breakdown

This example showcases a cavern level, high up in a snowy arctic mountain range. Within the cave, water cascades across moss-covered rock formations, trickling into rich, flowing pools on the cavern floor. Mysterious and seemingly magical flame sources provide an eerie light. Outside, a harsh blizzard rips through the rocky crags.

## Deconstructing Particle Examples

The documentation included with this example is intended to help you get off the ground and see what is going on with each of these Particle System effects. However, if you really want to gain a solid understanding of how each one was created, you would do well to open them up and have a look at how they were assembled. Throughout these documents, we will give the folder path you can use to locate each effect within the **Content Browser**. Alternatively, you can also simply select an effect that interests you, either by clicking on it in the Viewport or in the World Outliner, and then pressing **Ctrl+B.** You can also **right-click** on the Actor (in the Viewport or the World Outliner) and choose **Show in Content Browser** from the context menu.

This will select the Particle System in the Content Browser. **Double-click** its icon in the Content Browser to open the effect up in **Cascade**, Unreal Engine 4's powerful particle editing system.

## Level Matinee Sequence

As a special treat to show off the effects in this level, we have included a Matinee sequence that does a nice cinematic flythrough. You can access it at any time during editor playback by tapping the **Spacebar**.
