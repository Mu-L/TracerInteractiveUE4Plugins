There are 3 types of lights in use in the daylight scene.

1. **Directional Light Stationary** - Provides the sunlight for the scene and therefore most of the bounced illumination.
1. **Spot Light Static** - These are placed just outside the window and simulate ambient light bouncing throughout the room.
1. **Spot Light Stationary** - These are placed above the picture frames in the room.


## Setup Considerations

For the daylight scene (_Room.umap_), the Stationary Directional Light provides the primary sunlight. An Atmospheric Fog Actor was added and the Stationary Directional Light was set up to be used as the Atmosphere Sun Light, providing a direction for the sun disc. 

Although the sunlight is bounced around by Lightmass, there are 4 Static Spot Lights that simulate bounced light from the sky. These are used instead of the **Lightmass Environment Light** found in the **World Settings** to allow more precise control over bounces throughout the room.
