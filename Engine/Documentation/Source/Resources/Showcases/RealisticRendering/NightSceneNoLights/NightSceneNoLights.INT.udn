There are 4 types of lights in use in the night no lights scene.

1. **Directional Light Stationary** - Provides the moonlight for the scene, seen primarily on the balcony.
1. **Spot Light Static** - These are placed just outside the window and simulate soft light entering the room from ambient sources.
1. **Spot Light Stationary** - These are placed within the lamp in the corner, simulating light exiting the top and bottom of the lamp shade. Another is used to create a cone of light from the flashlight on the floor.
1. **Point Light Movable** - These are grouped to the flashlight that lies on the floor. They simulate light bouncing from the flashlight.


## Setup Considerations

This level plays a little differently from the other two. Instead of a cinematic sequence, the player moves around the room with a floating flashlight.

The 4-light limitation is particularly pertinent in this level, as the player is carrying one of those lights (the flashlight). This means the level had to be crated in such a way that no more than *three* shadowing stationary lights were overlapping anywhere that the flashlight could be shone.
