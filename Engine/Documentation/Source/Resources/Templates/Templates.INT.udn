When you would like to jump into creating a particular type of game, you can use a template to start your game off and get right to implementing your gameplay ideas. Templates are available in two versions: 
there is a **C++** version if you are comfortable working at that level, and there is a **Blueprint** version which has the same behavior implemented in visual script for fast iteration by designers and artists.

While there are a number of different templates, the links below are full of different ideas to get you started with the First Person or Third Person templates. Each idea has links to the learning resources
that will help you take a template even further.
