Blueprint Class Walkthrough
[/VAR]

You have opened a Blueprint Class. 

The Blueprint Editor adapts to the type of Blueprint you are editing. This tutorial will walk you through the interface elements available to you when you edit Level Blueprints.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Defaults Mode
[/VAR]
When working with Blueprint Classes, there are three modes available in the Blueprint Editor. To switch between the modes, use the buttons on the right side of the Toolbar.

This button switches the Blueprint Editor to Defaults Mode. 

**Click it now to switch to Defaults Mode, then click "Next" to continue.**

[/EXCERPT:Stage15]



[EXCERPT:Stage2]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Defaults
[/VAR]

The Class Defaults or Defaults mode displays all of the properties of the Blueprint. The values set for these properties in the Defaults mode will be used when new instances of the Blueprint are created.

[EXCERPT:Stage3]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Components Mode
[/VAR]

This button switches the Blueprint Editor to Components Mode.

**Click it now to switch to Components Mode, then click "Next" to continue.**

[/EXCERPT:Stage3]



[EXCERPT:Stage3.1]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Components Mode
[/VAR]

In Components Mode, you can add components to your Blueprint, manage the details of existing components, and arrange components. The list of components in Components Mode is hierarchical.

[EXCERPT:Stage3.2]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Viewport
[/VAR]

In the Viewport, you can view and manipulate your Blueprint's components.

[/EXCERPT:Stage3.2]




[EXCERPT:Stage4]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Components
[/VAR]

The Components pane allows components to be added to the Blueprint upon creation. This provides a means of adding collision geometry via CapsuleComponents, BoxComponents, or SphereComponents, adding rendered geometry in the form of StaticMeshComponents or SkeletalMeshComponents, controlling movement using MovementComponents, etc. The components added in the Components list can also be assigned to instance variables providing access to them in the graphs of this or other Blueprints.

[EXCERPT:Stage5]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Details
[/VAR]

The Details panel is a context-sensitive area that provides editing access to the properties of selected items within the Blueprint Editor. It contains a search bar for fast access to specific properties, and will generally contain one or more collapsible categories to organize the included properties.

[EXCERPT:Stage6]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Graph Mode
[/VAR]

This button switches the Blueprint Editor to Graph Mode.

**Click it now to switch to Graph Mode, then click "Next" to continue.**

[/EXCERPT:Stage6]





[EXCERPT:Stage7]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Graph Mode
[/VAR]

This is the Blueprint Editor's Graph Mode, where you can add and remove nodes, create variables and functions, and wire nodes together to create gameplay-driven functionality. Breakpoints can also be set in the Graph Mode to aid in debugging Blueprints.



[/EXCERPT:Stage7]


[EXCERPT:Stage8]
[VAR:StageTitle]
The Graph
[/VAR]

The Graph Editor panel is the heart of the Blueprint system. It is here that you will create the networks of nodes and wires that will define your scripted behavior. Nodes can quickly be selected by clicking on them and repositioned via dragging. To switch to a new EventGraph, function graph, or macro graph, either select its tab at the top of the Graph Editor panel or double-click its name in the My Blueprint panel.

[/EXCERPT:Stage8]



[EXCERPT:Stage9]
[VAR:StageTitle]
My Blueprint
[/VAR]

The My Blueprint panel displays the variables, functions, graphs, macros, and events available to be used in the Level Blueprint. This is essentially an outline of the Blueprint that lets you easily view existing elements of the Blueprint, as well as create new ones.

[/EXCERPT:Stage9]




[EXCERPT:Stage10]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Details
[/VAR]

The Details panel is a context-sensitive area that provides editing access to the properties of selected items within the Blueprint Editor. It contains a search bar for fast access to specific properties, and will generally contain one or more collapsible categories to organize the included properties.

When you first add a new variable to a Blueprint, you will need to compile the Blueprint once before you can edit the variable's value in the Details panel.

[/EXCERPT:Stage10]



[EXCERPT:Stage11]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Palette
[/VAR]

The Palette is like a toolbox, containing all the nodes you could add to your Blueprint. For easy access to the nodes you use most often, you can search, add nodes to your Favorites, or filter to show only nodes that are compatible with a specific class type. Adding nodes to a graph from the Palette is as simple as dragging and dropping.

The Palette is divided into two sections: Favorites and Find a Node.

[Read more about the Palette.](DOCLINK:Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/Palette)



[/EXCERPT:Stage11]



[EXCERPT:Stage12]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Palette: Favorites
[/VAR]

You can save your most commonly used nodes in the Favorites section for quick access.  To add a node from the Find a Node section, right-click and select Add to Favorites from the menu. 

When using the Graph Editor panel's context menu, you can star nodes to add them to your favorites as well. 



[/EXCERPT:Stage12]



[EXCERPT:Stage13]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Palette: Find a Node
[/VAR]

The Find a Node section of the Palette is an extensive directory of nodes. To refine this list, you can search, filter by compatible class, or browse by category. This section of the Palette also gives quick access to adding comments and Timelines. 



[/EXCERPT:Stage13]




[EXCERPT:Stage14]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Toolbar
[/VAR]
Much like the Blueprint Editor as a whole adapts to the type of Blueprint you are editing, the buttons on the Toolbar change depending on your current task.

The Compile button highlighted here will compile your Blueprint, and will display warnings or errors if there is an issue you need to address. 

[Read more about the Toolbar.](DOCLINK:Engine/Blueprints/Editor/UIComponents/Toolbar)
