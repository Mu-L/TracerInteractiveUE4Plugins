Blueprint Interface Walkthrough 
[/VAR]

You have opened a Blueprint Interface. This is an advanced feature of the Blueprints system, allowing you to create a collection of functions that can be called and implemented in different Blueprints.

The Blueprint Editor adapts to the type of Blueprint you are editing. This tutorial will walk you through the interface elements available to you when you edit Level Blueprints.

Graph Mode
[/VAR]

Blueprint Interfaces are collections of interface functions, so when working with them, the Blueprint Editor is in Graph Mode.

However, because functions are not edited within the Blueprint Interface, only a subset of the panels are available.

[VAR:StageTitle]
My Blueprint
[/VAR]

The My Blueprint panel displays the functions stored in the Blueprint Interface. This is essentially a directory that lets you easily view existing functions, as well as create new ones.

Details
[/VAR]

The Details panel is a context-sensitive area that provides editing access to the properties of selected items within the Blueprint Editor. It contains a search bar for fast access to specific properties, and will generally contain one or more collapsible categories to organize the included properties.

To add and remove inputs and outputs for a function in the interface, or set other properties of the function, select the function's name in the My Blueprint panel and then use the Details panel to change the properties.

The Graph
[/VAR]

By default, there are no Functions in the Blueprint Interface's My Blueprint Panel. Go ahead and create one now by clicking the "Add Function" button in the My Blueprint Panel.

**Click the "Add Function" button, then click "Next" to continue.**

The Graph
[/VAR]

Creating a function in a Blueprint Interface creates a graph and opens the Graph Editor panel, but you will not be able to add nodes or edit the graph. 

Each Blueprint that uses a function from a Blueprint Interface can have different implementations, which are set up in the individual Blueprints.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Toolbar
[/VAR]
Much like the Blueprint Editor as a whole adapts to the type of Blueprint you are editing, the buttons on the Toolbar change depending on your current task.

The Compile button highlighted here will compile your Blueprint, and will display warnings or errors if there is an issue you need to address.
