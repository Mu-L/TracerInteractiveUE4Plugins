Blueprint Macro Library Walkthrough
[/VAR]

You have opened a Blueprint Macro Library. This is an advanced feature of the Blueprints system, allowing you to create a collection of reusable macro graphs for use in many different Blueprints.

The Blueprint Editor adapts to the type of Blueprint you are editing. This tutorial will walk you through the interface elements available to you when you edit Level Blueprints.

Graph Mode
[/VAR]

Blueprint Macro Libraries are collections of macro graphs, so when working with them, you have access to many graph editing tools. 

This is the Blueprint Editor's Graph Mode, where you can add and remove nodes, create variables and functions, and wire nodes together to create gameplay-driven functionality. Breakpoints can also be set in the Graph Mode to aid in debugging Blueprints.

[VAR:StageTitle]
My Blueprint
[/VAR]

The My Blueprint panel displays the macros stored in the Blueprint Macro Library. This is essentially a directory of your Blueprint Macro Library that lets you easily view existing macros, as well as create new ones.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Details
[/VAR]

The Details panel is a context-sensitive area that provides editing access to the properties of selected items within the Blueprint Editor. It contains a search bar for fast access to specific properties, and will generally contain one or more collapsible categories to organize the included properties.

To add and remove inputs and outputs for a macro in the library, or set other properties of the macro, select the macro's name in the My Blueprint panel and then use the Details panel to change the properties.

[EXCERPT:Stage5]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Palette
[/VAR]

The Palette is like a toolbox, containing all the nodes you could add to your Blueprint. For easy access to the nodes you use most often, you can search, add nodes to your Favorites, or filter to show only nodes that are compatible with a specific class type. Adding nodes to a graph from the Palette is as simple as dragging and dropping.

The Palette is divided into two sections: Favorites and Find a Node.

[EXCERPT:Stage6]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Palette: Favorites
[/VAR]

You can save your most commonly used nodes in the Favorites section for quick access.  To add a node from the Find a Node section, right-click and select Add to Favorites from the menu. 

When using the Graph Editor panel's context menu, you can star nodes to add them to your favorites as well.

Palette: Find a Node
[/VAR]

The Find a Node section of the Palette is an extensive directory of nodes. To refine this list, you can search, filter by compatible class, or browse by category. This section of the Palette also gives quick access to adding comments and Timelines.

[VAR:StageTitle]
The Graph
[/VAR]

The final interface panel is the Graph panel, but this will not show until there is a macro in the Blueprint Macro Library. You can create a Macro now using the button in the My Blueprint panel to summon the Graph Editor panel.

**Click the Macro button, then click "Next" to continue.**

[VAR:StageTitle]
The Graph
[/VAR]

The Graph Editor panel is the heart of the Blueprint system. It is here that you will create the networks of nodes and wires that will define your scripted behavior. Nodes can quickly be selected by clicking on them and repositioned via dragging. To switch to a new EventGraph, function graph, or macro graph, either select its tab at the top of the Graph Editor panel or double-click its name in the My Blueprint panel.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Toolbar
[/VAR]

Much like the Blueprint Editor as a whole adapts to the type of Blueprint you are editing, the buttons on the Toolbar change depending on your current task.
