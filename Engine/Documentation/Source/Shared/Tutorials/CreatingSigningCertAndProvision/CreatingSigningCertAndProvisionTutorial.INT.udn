It appears that you do not have a valid signing certificate or mobile provision. 

If you are not already a registered iOS developer, you will first need to sign up for the Apple IOS Developer Program on the site below:

Once you are registered as an iOS developer, you also need to do the following (using Apple's instructions):

* Create a certificate using the Unreal iOS Configuration Wizard (iPhonePackager.exe), located in `Engine\Binaries\DotNET\IOS`. If you are a new developer, use the Generate Certificate Request Window to generate a key pair for signing your iOS applications and a certificate request that is used to generate a certificate on Apple's Developer website.

* Create an App ID (it is fine to use * for the user specified portion).
* Create a provisioning profile.

The iPhone Packager contains the following tabs:

* New User - The New User tab contains tools for developers who have not developed iOS applications previously.
* Already a registered iOS developer - The Already a Registered iOS Developer tab contains tools for developers who have previously developed iOS applications, either using Unreal or through other methods, and already have a development certificate and provisioning profile.
