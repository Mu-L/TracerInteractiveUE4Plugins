Welcome to the Destructible Mesh Editor
[/VAR]

Welcome to the Destructible Mesh editor. This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements. Links to the documentation are provided in most sections, so you can read further on any topic that catches your interest.

Destructible Meshes
[/VAR]

When you need something to shatter, break, crumble, or succumb to the rigors of battle, "Destructible Actors", when used effectively, add a layer of believability to your worlds. There are a few things to remember when setting up your Destructible Meshes:

* The mesh used should be closed, no holes, or visual artifacts will occur.
* If you wish to have the mesh break when colliding with other Actors, it needs to have collision.

If the mesh has any holes, the fracture will succeed but there will be no internal polygons to render (in the areas where the fracture would have cut through the empty area).

Primary Settings
[/VAR]

![](Primary01.png)

The primary settings for generating a Destructible Mesh are the "Cell Site Count" and the "Seed."

The "Cell Site Count" is the number of fracture bits that will be generated, while the "Seed" is what is fed into the random number generator for creating unique fractures.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Fracturing
[/VAR]

With the "Cell Site Count" and "Seed" values adjusted, press the "Fracture Mesh" button.

Once fractured, use the "Explode Amount" slider to see the results of the fracture.

If the fracture is not quite what you are looking for, adjust the "Seed" or "Cell Site Count" and re-fracture until you get what you want.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Properties: Basics
[/VAR]

Destructible Meshes have a large number of properties, and you will spend a good amount of time in here to get the desired behavior you want.

![](props02.png)

You do not need to re-fracture after changing these values.

[EXCERPT:D5.1]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Properties: Basics
[/VAR]

The key properties to be aware of are: Damage Threshold, Impact Damage, Default Impact Damage Depth, Damage Cap, and Impact Velocity Threshold.

![](props.png)

* Damage Threshold - How much damage is needed to start the fracture.
* Impact Damage - How much damage is caused by an impact.
* Default Impact Damage Depth - How deep the impact damage goes.
* Damage Cap - How much damage the Destructible Actor can take at one time.
* Impact Velocity Threshold - How fast the impact must be before impact damage is taken.

[EXCERPT:D6]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Properties: Support
[/VAR]

Of special note is the property called "Support Depth" under the "Special Hierarchy Depths." At the fracture depth and above, this value is set to, the destructible mesh will hold together through damage instead of completely fracturing once any damage is done.

![](support.png)

Continuing to apply damage to the Destructible Actor will cause further chunks to break off.

[EXCERPT:D7]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Properties: FX
[/VAR]

Fracture Effects are sounds and particle effects that will fire off from the breaking of the Destructible Actor. Without support, only one effect will fire, as only one break event will actually occur. However, with support, you will have a number of effects being created.

![](fx.png)

The effects are created at the average location of all the fracture chunks created in the breaking.

Properties
[/VAR]

Of course Destructible Meshes have many more properties for tweaking how they fracture, how they look when they fracture, how long chunks should hang around, etc... All of these are covered in the documentation.

If you desire more than one fracture level, you will need to use the NVIDIA APEX PhysX Lab tool.

You will need to register with NVIDIA to be able to download the APEX Physics Lab.

Conclusion
[/VAR]

The documentation for Destructible Meshes and Destructible Actors are still in progress. This tutorial will be updated with more links once the documentation is complete.
