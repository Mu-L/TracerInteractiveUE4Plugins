Welcome to the Material Editor
[/VAR]

Welcome to the Material Editor for Unreal Engine 4. This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements. Links to the documentation are provided in most sections, so you can read further on any topic that catches your interest.

[EXCERPT:Graph]
[VAR:StageTitle]
The Graph
[/VAR]

Each Material is represented by a graph, which hold nodes connected with wires to define a shader. The large gridded area in the center of the Material Editor is the Graph Panel.

[EXCERPT:MaterialNode]
[VAR:StageTitle]
The Graph
[/VAR]

Every Material will have a base Material Node. The networks you create will eventually connect to one (or more) of the pins on the base Material node.

![](baseMaterialNode.png)

Selecting the Base Material Node will update the Details Panel to show all the general Material properties. From here you can set Translucency, Tessellation, Two Sided, and many more options for your Materials.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Creating Nodes
[/VAR]

There are a few ways to create nodes in the Material Editor. From the Palette Panel you can click and drag nodes into the Graph View.

![](ClicknDrag.png)

You can also:
* Right-click in the Graph View to create a node at the cursor location.
* Click and drag a texture from the Content Browser into the graph.
* Drag off a pin into the Graph area to create a new node and wire them together.

[EXCERPT:Stage3]


Every node has a number of pins. Pins on the left are input pins, while those on the right are output pins. You can wire any input pin to an output pin by clicking and dragging from one to the other.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Creation Hotkeys
[/VAR]

There are hotkeys for creation of some nodes. Hold down one of these keys and left-click in the Material Graph area.

1, 2, 3, or 4 : Create a 1-4 Vector Constant Node
U : TexCoord (UV Coordinates) Node
T : Texture Sampler Node
S, or V : Create a Scalar or Vector Parameter
A, D, or M : Create an Add, Divide, or Multiply Node

![](HotkeyNodes.png)

More hotkeys can be found by looking in the Palette Panel or you can set your own through the Edit Menu -> Editor Preferences -> Keyboard Shortcuts -> Material Editor - Spawn Nodes. The Material Editor must be open for this category to show.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Preview Viewport
[/VAR]

The viewport uses standard viewport navigation controls, with the addition of the ability to change the position of the light by using L + left-click in the viewport.

![](sphereLight.png)

To change the shape of the preview object, use the viewport tool bar. The icon that looks like a small teapot will use the currently selected mesh in the Content Browser.

![](viewportShapes.png)

From here you can also toggle the grid and realtime preview of the viewport.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Live Updates
[/VAR]

When making changes to a network, it can be useful to get immediate feedback from each change in realtime. The Material Editor offers two features in the Graph to give you instantaneous feedback for your network: Live Nodes and Live Update.

![](toolbar_live_nodes.png)

Live Nodes allows for any constant changes that the nodes make - due to such expressions as Panners - to playback in realtime. 

![](toolbar_live_update.png)

Live Update, on the other hand, allows for each node within the network to have its shader recompiled whenever a change is made. These changes include creation of new nodes, deletion of nodes, node connections and disconnections, and changes in properties. This recompilation is necessary so that the Material preview drawn at that node is up to date. However, recompiling these intermediate shaders can be time-consuming, especially if your Material contains many nodes.  If you are experiencing long wait times after every change, you may want to deactivate the Live Update option.

[See the Material Editor documentation for more information.](DOCLINK:Engine/Rendering/Materials/Editor#LiveNodesandLiveUpdate)

[VAR:StageTitle]
Apply
[/VAR]

The Apply button on the toolbar deploys any changes made in the Material Editor to the original Material, and any uses of that Material in the world.

![](apply.png)

This will also occur if you apply Material changes during Simulate in Editor or Play in Editor.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Parameters
[/VAR]

Parameter nodes are expressions that expose properties to Material Instances to be overridden, either to create variations of a Material using Material Instance Constant assets or modified at runtime using Material Instances Dynamic assets.

[See the Parameters Reference for more information.](DOCLINK:Engine/Rendering/Materials/ExpressionReference/Parameters)

[VAR:StageTitle]
Material Functions
[/VAR]

Material Functions are little snippets of Material graphs that can be saved in packages and reused across multiple Materials. They allow complex networks to be saved out and quickly reused, while also allowing more complex networks to be abstracted into single nodes, making Material creation easier for artists.
