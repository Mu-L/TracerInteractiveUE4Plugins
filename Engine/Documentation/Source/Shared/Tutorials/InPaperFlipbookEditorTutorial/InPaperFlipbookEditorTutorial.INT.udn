Welcome to the Paper2D Flipbook Editor which enables you to set up sprite animations for use in 2D games.  This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements.

### Early Access Preview

Flipbooks and the flipbook editor are considered an 'early access preview'.  While not considered production-ready, they are a step beyond 'experimental' and are being provided as a preview of things to come:

* We will try to provide forward-compatibility for content you create.
* The classes may change significantly in the future.
* The code is in an early state and may not meet the desired polish / quality bar.
* There is probably no documentation or example content yet.
* They will be promoted out of 'Early Access' when they are production ready.
