Welcome to the Paper2D Sprite Editor which enables setup and editing of individual sprite assets.  This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements.

### Early Access Preview

Sprites and the sprite editor are considered an 'early access preview'.  While not considered production-ready, they are a step beyond 'experimental' and are being provided as a preview of things to come:

* We will try to provide forward-compatibility for content you create.
* The classes may change significantly in the future.
* The code is in an early state and may not meet the desired polish / quality bar.
* There is probably no documentation or example content yet.
* They will be promoted out of 'Early Access' when they are production ready.
