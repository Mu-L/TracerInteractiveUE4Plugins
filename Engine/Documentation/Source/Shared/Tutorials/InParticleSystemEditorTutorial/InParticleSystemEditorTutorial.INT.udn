Welcome to Cascade
[/VAR]

Cascade is the Particle Editor for Unreal Engine 4. This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements. Links to the documentation are provided in most sections, so you can read further on any topic that catches your interest.

Emitters
[/VAR]

The Emitters Panel contains each Particle Emitter within the Particle System currently open in Cascade.

![](CascadeTutorial_Emitters.png)

Each column represents a single Particle Emitter which is filled with a number of modules. The Emitter Module at the top houses the primary properties of the Emitter, such as name and type for the Emitter, while the modules beneath it each control various aspects of the Particle System behavior.

Emitters
[/VAR]

To add an Emitter to a Particle System, use the context menu by right-clicking in the empty area in the Emitters Panel, or by right-clicking an Emitter.

Modules
[/VAR]

Modules slot into an Emitter, modifying how the particles look and move.

![](CascadeTutorial_Modules01.png)

Modules can affect properties like where particles will spawn, how they will move, their colors, and many more.  These can be added through the context menu by right-clicking on the Particle Emitter.

Details
[/VAR]

The Details Panel shows the properties of the currently selected Emitter or module.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Details
[/VAR]

The Details Panel shows the properties of the currently selected Emitter or module. 

![](CascadeTutorial_Details02.png)

The properties contained within each Emitter and module are how you will craft your Particle Systems. While many of the properties for Particle Systems are static values that affect the entire system, the properties that need to affect individual particles, usually over their lifetime, will have a special property called "Distribution."

[For more information, see the Cascade Particle Editor Documentation.](DOCLINK:Engine\Rendering\ParticleSystems\Cascade#DetailsPanel)

[EXCERPT:Stage4.2]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Distributions
[/VAR]

Distributions enable you to adjust values over the lifetime of a particle.

![](CascadeTutorial_Details03.png)

Distributions are a group of data types that provide flexibility by allowing for constant values, random values within a range, values interpolated along a curve, and values driven by parameters.

[Read more about Distributions on the Engine Basics Documentation page.](DOCLINK:Engine/Basics/Distributions)

[/EXCERPT:Stage4.2]



[EXCERPT:Stage5]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Curves
[/VAR]

Distributions can be visualized as curves by using the Curve Editor.

![](CascadeTutorial_Curves01.png)

To visualize them in the curve editor, click the graph icon on a module.

[For usage details, see the Curve Editor documentation.](DOCLINK:Engine/UI/CurveEditor)

[/EXCERPT:Stage5]



[EXCERPT:Stage5.1]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Curves
[/VAR]

The sections at the left of the curve editor are the tracks.

![](CascadeTutorial_Curves02.png)

Within those sections you will see a number of smaller boxes. The boxes indicated by the "1" show or hide the individual data curves. For example: a color will have red, blue, and green curves, the boxes on the left will show or hide them in the curve editor.

The boxes indicated by the "2" hide all the curves of the track.


[For usage details, see the Curve Editor documentation.](DOCLINK:Engine/UI/CurveEditor)

[VAR:StageTitle]
Curves
[/VAR]

To make editing curves easier, here are the mouse shortcuts for manipulating them.

![](CascadeTutorial_Curves03.png)

 LMB on Key : Select Key  
 Ctrl + LMB on point : Toggle selection of point  
 Ctrl + LMB on curve : Add new key at clicked location  
 Ctrl + LMB + Drag : Move current selection  
 Ctrl + Alt + LMB Drag : Box select  
 Ctrl + Alt + Shift + LMB + Drag : Box select (add to current selection)  

[For usage details, see the Curve Editor documentation.](DOCLINK:Engine/UI/CurveEditor)
