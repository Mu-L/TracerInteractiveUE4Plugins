Welcome to Persona: Skeletal Mesh Mode
[/VAR]

Welcome to the Skeletal Mesh editor portion of Persona. This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements. Links to the documentation are provided in most sections, so you can read further on any topic that catches your interest.

Skeletal meshes are built up of two parts, a set of polygons composed to make up the surface of the Skeletal Mesh and a hierarchical set of interconnected bones which can be used to animate the polygons.

Materials
[/VAR]

You can change the Materials of the Skeletal Mesh by using the Mesh Details Panel. Each Element of the Skeletal Mesh will have its own Material.

Animation Preview
[/VAR]

Hovering the mouse over an animation asset in the Asset Browser will show a floating preview of that asset.

Sockets
[/VAR]

Commonly in games, you will want to attach an object to the bone of a character. This might be a weapon attached to a hand, or a hat attached to the head. For this purpose, Unreal Engine allows you to create sockets in Persona which are offset from a bone within the Skeletal Mesh. Sockets can then be translated, rotated, and scaled relative to the bone. This allows content creators to easily set up sockets for a Skeletal Mesh, and then tell the programmer the names of the sockets to attach objects to.

Right-clicking a bone in the Skeleton Tree will bring up the context menu where you can add a socket. They can then be manipulated using the transform tools, or their offsets can be directly typed into the Details Panel.



[See the Sockets documentation for details on their usage.](DOCLINK:Engine/Content/Types/SkeletalMeshes/Sockets)

Retargeting Animation
[/VAR]

Animation retargeting is a feature that allows animations to be reused between characters that share the same Skeleton asset, but have vastly different proportions. Through retargeting, you can prevent your animated skeletons from losing their proportions or becoming unnecessarily deformed when using animations from differently shaped characters.

Morph Targets
[/VAR]

The Morph Target Previewer allows you to preview any morph targets (also known as "morphs" and "blend shapes", depending on what 3D animation package you are using) that are applied to your Skeletal Meshes. Each Morph Target is additively blended into the existing Skeletal Mesh geometry. This allows for multiple morph targets to be combined to create complex vertex-driven animation, which is often ideal for such things as facial expressions.

[For information on creating Morph Targets, see the FBX documentation.](DOCLINK:Engine/Content/FBX/MorphTargets)
