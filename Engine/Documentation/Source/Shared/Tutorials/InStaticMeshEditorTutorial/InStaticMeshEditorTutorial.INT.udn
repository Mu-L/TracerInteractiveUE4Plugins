Welcome to the Static Mesh Editor
[/VAR]

Welcome to the Static Mesh Editor for Unreal Engine 4. This quick start guide describes the basic usage of commonly used interface elements. Links to the documentation are provided in most sections, so you can read further on any topic that catches your interest.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Viewport
[/VAR]

The Viewport previews the Static Mesh you have opened. It will also display a number of statistics for the opened Static Mesh.

![](SMEViewport.png)

The Viewport uses the same controls as the Level Editor Viewport.
* Hold RMB + W, A, S, or D to fly.
* Alt + LMB to orbit the Static Mesh.
* ALT + RMB or the mouse wheel to zoom.
* F will focus on the opened Static Mesh.

[See the Viewport Controls page for more information and alternate controls.](DOCLINK:Engine/UI/LevelEditor/Viewports/ViewportControls)

Details Panel
[/VAR]

The Details Panel houses all of the properties for the  Static Mesh currently being edited.

Materials
[/VAR]

A common task in the Static Mesh Editor is to assign Materials to Static Meshes. Each LOD can have different Materials.

![](materials.png)

Each Element represents a sub-mesh of the Static Mesh, and will require its own Material. If the same material is being used for two elements, it is best to merge those in your 3D art creation tool.

[EXCERPT:Stage3]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Light Map Resolution
[/VAR]

Regardless of the size of your Static Mesh, it will have a default value of 32 for its Light Map Resolution. This is the size of each side of the 2D texture that will be created for the Light Map.

![](staticMeshSettings.png)

Depending on the usage of the Static Mesh, it is advisable to adjust this value to meet your quality and performance goals. You can always override this on a Static Mesh Actor if a specific instance of the Static Mesh needs more or less Light Map resolution.

[For more information, see the Lightmass documentation.](DOCLINK:Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/Lightmass)

Unique UV's
[/VAR]

Lightmass, the static light baking system in Unreal Engine 4, requires non-overlapping UVs to work. You can generate a set of non-overlapping UVs for a Static Mesh by accessing the Generate Unique UVs tool in the Window menu, "Generate Unique UVs."

[VAR:StageTitle]
Unique UV's
[/VAR]

To view your UV channels, click the UV button on the toolbar. You can change the UV channel you are viewing with the UV Channel selector:

![](UniqueUVsLayouts.png)

By default, Unreal Engine 4 will use the UVs found in UV Channel 1 for baking light maps. If UV Channel 1 does not exist, it will revert to UV Channel 0.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Collision
[/VAR]

The Static Mesh Editor includes tools for creating collision for your Static Meshes.

![](collisionTypes.png)

The ##DOP are the K-DOP simple collision generators. K-DOP is a type of bounding volume that basically takes K axis-aligned planes and pushes them as close to the mesh as it can, where K is the number of planes. For example: the 6DOP uses 6 planes and the 18DOP uses 18 planes.

[See the Static Mesh Collision Reference for more information.](DOCLINK:Engine/Physics/Collision/Reference)

To view the collision, use the Show Collision button on the toolbar:

[/EXCERPT:Stage4]

[EXCERPT:Stage5]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Collision
[/VAR]

The Auto Convex Collision option will open the Convex Decomposition tab:

![](collisionTypesAutoCon.png)

This will generate a number of hulls defined by the Max Hulls value to generate the collision for the Static Mesh. This will generate collision more closely resembling the surface of the Static Mesh.

[See the Static Mesh Collision Reference for more information.](DOCLINK:Engine/Physics/Collision/Reference)

You can also define collision in your 3D art creation tool. See:
[FBX Static Mesh Pipeline](DOCLINK:Engine/Content/FBX/StaticMeshes#collision)

[EXCERPT:Stage6]
[VAR:StageTitle]
Sockets
[/VAR]

Commonly in games, you will want to attach an object to a Static Mesh Actor. This might be a weapon pickup, or placing a key into the keyhole. Sockets give programmers and designers a point for attaching objects together. You can access the Socket Manager from the Window menu -> Socket Manager.

![](sockets01.png)

You can create a  Socket using the Create Socket button, then move, rotate, and scale that Socket using the Static Mesh Socket properties. You can also move the Socket using the Move Tool in the Viewport.
