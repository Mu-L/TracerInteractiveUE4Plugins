Viewport
[/VAR]

In the center of the screen is the main 3D Viewport. It is your window into the worlds you create in Unreal. Viewports can be navigated just as you would in a game, or can be used in a more schematic design sense as you would for an architectural blueprint. They also contain a variety of tools and visualizers to help you see exactly the data you need.

Modes

The Content Browser is the primary area for creating, importing, organizing, viewing, and modifying content assets within Unreal Editor.  It also provides the ability to manage content folders and perform other useful operations on assets, such as renaming, moving, copying, and viewing references.

The Content Browser can search for and interact with all assets in the game project.
