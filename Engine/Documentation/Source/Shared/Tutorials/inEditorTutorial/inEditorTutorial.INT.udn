![](Stage8.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage8]


[EXCERPT:Stage9]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Scene Outliner Basics
[/VAR]



The Scene Outliner is a UE4 tool that contains a list of all the objects in your level. Within it, you can double click any object to focus on it.

1. In the Scene Outliner, double click "Floor Mesh."


[/EXCERPT:Stage9]


[EXCERPT:Stage10]

[VAR:StageTitle]

[/VAR]



Now, let us rotate the "TutorialShape" by using the Rotate tool.
1. In the upper-right section of the viewport, find the manipulation tools.
1. Click the second one, which is the Rotate tool.

Note that when you do so, the Rotate tool's directional arcs replace the Move tools directional arrows.


[/EXCERPT:Stage27]




[EXCERPT:Stage28]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Placing Objects: Rotation
[/VAR]



With the Rotate tool enabled, you can now rotate the "TutorialShape" around.
1. Move the mouse pointer over the Rotate tool. Note how the different directional arcs, which represent the x, y, and z axes, turn yellow when you mouse over them. When an arc has turned yellow, you can drag it to rotate the "TutorialShape" along that axis.
1. Rotate the "TutorialShape" object along any axis.

![](Stage29.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage28]

1. Find the manipulation tools in the upper-right section of the viewport.
1. Click the third one, which is the Scale tool.



[/EXCERPT:Stage30]



[EXCERPT:Stage31]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Placing Objects: Scale
[/VAR]



With the Scale tool enabled, we can now change the size of the "TutorialShape."
1. Move the mouse pointer over the Scale tool. Note how parts of the Scale tool turn yellow as you mouse over them.
1. As with the Move and Rotate tools, you can drag along any axis to scale the object along that axis. You can also scale along two axes simultaneously by moving the mouse pointer until both axes turn yellow, and then dragging.
1. To scale evenly along all three axes, drag the small white cube where all three axes of the Scale tool intersect.

![](Stage32.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage31]


[EXCERPT:Stage32]

[VAR:StageTitle]

[/VAR]



By now, the "TutorialShape" should be at least 1000 units in the air, have some rotation, and be scaled larger or smaller along its various axes.

![](Stage34.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage33]


[EXCERPT:Stage34]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Placing Objects: Simulate
[/VAR]



For the last portion of this tutorial, we will use gravity simulated by the Unreal Engine to make the "TutorialShape" object fall to the ground.

![](Stage35.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage34]


[EXCERPT:Stage35]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Placing Objects: Simulate
[/VAR]



Let us start by setting the physics for the "TutorialShape."
1. With the "TutorialShape" selected, in the Details panel, scroll down to the Physics section. If necessary, expand the section by clicking the small arrow to its left.
1. Check the check box next to "Simulate Physics."  This enables the Unreal Editor to simulate physics for this object.

![](Stage36.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage35]


[EXCERPT:Stage36]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Placing Objects: Simulate
[/VAR]



In order to simulate physics for the "TutorialShape," you can use the Unreal Editor's "Simulate" mode.
1. Click the "Simulate" button in the toolbar at the top of the Unreal Editor window.
1. If you cannot see the "TutorialShape" fall, navigate around the viewport until you find it. You can drag it upward with the Move tool and drop it again.

[/EXCERPT:Stage36]



[EXCERPT:Stage37]

[VAR:StageTitle]
Placing Objects: Simulate
[/VAR]



When you are done simulating the physics, click the Stop button in the toolbar at the top of the window to stop "Simulate" mode.

![](Stage39.png)

[/EXCERPT:Stage37]



[EXCERPT:Stage39]

[VAR:StageTitle]
The End
[/VAR]



This concludes the basic Unreal Engine 4 In Editor tutorial. You now know the basics of how to create new levels; navigate around in the viewport; use the Content Browser, the Scene Outliner, and the Details panel; place objects into the level; move, rotate, and scale objects in the world; and use "Simulate" to see how the level operates at run time.

 You can click the "Home" button at the bottom of this window to try out other tutorials and walkthroughs, or you can simply close this tutorial to jump into using the Unreal Editor.
