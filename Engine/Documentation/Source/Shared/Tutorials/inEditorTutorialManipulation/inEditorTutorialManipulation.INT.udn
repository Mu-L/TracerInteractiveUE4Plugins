Creating an Actor
[/VAR]

To keep things simple, we will be working with a Geometry Actor. Using the Placement Tool, Geometry category, drag a Box into the world.

Gizmo Overview
[/VAR]

With this Geometry Actor in the world, you can see your first of the manipulation gizmos: the Translation Tool. Each of the colored arrows are associated with an axis.

At any time you can switch to the Translation Tool by pressing the "W" key.

As you move the mouse cursor over the axes they will turn yellow, identifying which axis you will move the Actor upon if you left-click and drag.

Gizmo Overview

Of special note are the connections between axes on the Translate and Scale Tools, these will allow you to translate and scale along the two axes that turn yellow.

Scale Tool
[/VAR]

Before you move the box around, let us get it to a more manageable size using the Scale Tool. You can click the highlighted button in the viewport, or press the "R" key.

Scale Tool
[/VAR]

With the Scale Tool selected, scale our box along the Y-Axis (green). Left-click and drag on the scale tool towards and eventually through the center of the Scale Gizmo, or in the direction that shrinks the box.

Feel free to scale the box to any size you are comfortable with before continuing.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Translation Tool
[/VAR]

Now, you need to raise the box above the surface. Switch to the Translation Tool by either left-clicking the highlighted button in the viewport or by using the "W" key.

[VAR:StageTitle]
Translation Tool
[/VAR]

Move the box above the surface by left-clicking and dragging on the ZAxis (blue).

You will notice only a wireframe of the box moves, this is normal. Once you release the left-mouse button the box will finalize its move.

Translation Tool
[/VAR]

Feel free to get used to the Translation Tool by moving the box around. Remember you can switch back to the Scale Tool by using the "R" key and back to the Translation Tool using the "W" key.

[/VAR]

Feel free to switch between tools and get used to using all of them. Perhaps use Place Mode within the Modes Panel to add more objects to the level and arrange them in an interesting way.
