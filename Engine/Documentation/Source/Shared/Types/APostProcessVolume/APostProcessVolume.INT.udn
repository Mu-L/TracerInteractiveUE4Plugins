Description:Overview of the PostProcessVolume class

[EXCERPT:APostProcessVolume]

The PostProcessVolume is a special type of volume that can be added to a level. Unreal Engine 3 had the post processing chains, but in Unreal Engine 4 all this got replaced by
using the PostProcessSettings which can be conveniently adjusted using one or multiple PostProcessVolume. By using multiple volumes (or other objects) with priority and weight
the settings can be softly blended depending on the camera position and manipulating weights.
