Once you've installed the Datasmith Exporter plugin for SketchUp, you'll have a new *.UDATASMITH* file type available to you when you export a scene.

Follow the steps below in SketchUp to export your scene using this new file type.

1.  From the SketchUp **File** menu, select **Export > 3D Model**.  
    ![Export 3D Model](sketchup_export_menu.png "Export 3D Model")
2.  In the **Export Model** window, select **Unreal Datasmith** from the **Save as type** drop-down list.  
    ![Set the folder, file name, and type](sketchup_export_model.png "Set the folder, file name, and type")
3.  Browse to the location where you want to save your new file, set its file name, and click **Export**.

### End Result

You should now be ready to try importing your new *.udatasmith* file into the Unreal Editor. See [Importing Datasmith Content into Unreal Engine 4](Studio/Datasmith/HowTo/ImportingContent).

[REGION:note]
Along with your new *.udatasmith* file, you'll see a folder that has the same name but with the suffix *_Assets*. If you move your *.udatasmith* file to a new location, make sure that you also move this folder to the same location.
