This page describes all the third-party software applications and data formats that Datasmith works with.

For each, the **Workflow Type** indicates how you package the information from your design application:

*   **Direct** means that Datasmith reads the application's file format directly.

*   **Export** means that you need to export the content from your application to a specific file format before Datasmith can import it into Unreal, using an exporter that is already built in to your application.

*   **Export Plugin** means that you need to install a new plugin into your application in order to export your design data into the format that Datasmith imports into Unreal.

[REGION:note]
All **Export Plugins**, as well as the Datasmith importer in the Unreal Editor, are only available for Microsoft Windows platforms.
[/REGION]

The last column, **Importer**, tells you what type of importer you need to use to bring in your content.

*   For most files, you'll choose a Datasmith importer from the Toolbar in the Unreal Editor. For more on this process, see [Importing Datasmith Content](Studio/Datasmith/HowTo/ImportingContent).

*   For the **Unreal Editor Import** type, use the **Import** button built in to the **Content Browser**, or simply drag and drop the file you want to import into the **Content Browser**.

## Formats Supported by Unreal Engine Directly

Unreal Engine offers built-in support for importing and exporting FBX files.

These FBX-based workflows are optimized to support game requirements, which tend to be focused on working with individual objects. Datasmith, by contrast, brings in entire scenes, potentially containing thousands of objects, each with its materials, pivots, scale, hierarchy, and metadata, from a wide range of sources. However, you should feel free to use the FBX import pipeline if it suits your needs. For example, you might use it to import pieces of additional set dressing that you'll use to augment your Datasmith content in your Unreal Level.

For details, you can read about our [FBX Content Pipeline](Engine/Content/FBX).  

[REGION:note]
As of Unreal Engine 4.19, there is also experimental support for importing the glTF format directly into the **Content Browser** using the built-in Unreal Editor importer. Like the FBX import process, this has been optimized for object-based workflows, and has different limitations compared to the Datasmith glTF importer. However, you might find it works for you in select cases. To try it out, go to **Edit > Plugins > Importers**, enable the **glTF Importer** plugin, and restart the Editor.

## Backward Compatibility

While Unreal Studio is in its open beta phase, we may from time to time need to change the Datasmith file format and the behavior of the importer plugins in order to add new features. During this period, we do not guarantee backward compatibility between all versions of Unreal and all versions of the Datasmith export plugins. Although it may work to import a *.udatasmith* file generated with an older version of an export plugin into a newer version of the Unreal Engine, we do not recommend depending on it. 

Always use the version of an export plugin that matches the version of the Unreal Engine and of the Datasmith plugin that you need to use that exported file with. To get the most out of Unreal Studio, and to make sure you benefit from the latest fixes and features in Datasmith, we recommend always using the latest possible version of the export plugins and of the Unreal Engine.
