## Major New Features

#### New: Sample Vehicle Game 
Vehicles are now fully supported in Unreal Engine! This sample game features an off-road vehicle and a looping track within a desert setting. Race across sand dunes, rocky cliffs and ancient ruins, and try to beat your best time!

![](veh02.png)

* Out of the box support for 4WD, FWD, and RWD drive trains.
* The default drive train simulation assumes 4 wheels; however it will work with any number of wheels.
* As many gears you desire.
* Automatic and semi-manual transmissions.
* And it is all completely exposed to Blueprints!

![](vehicleProps2.png)(w:935)

* Documentation can be found here:
	* [Vehicle Content Guide](Engine/Physics/Vehicles/VehicleContentCreation)
	* [Vehicle Setup Guide](Engine/Physics/Vehicles/VehicleUserGuide)

#### New: Camera Animation System
Support for **CameraAnims** has now been added into Unreal Engine 4! These are very similar to CameraAnims from Unreal Engine 3, but now expanded with Blueprint support.

* Conceptually, a **CameraAnim** is simply an animation that can be layered onto the in-game camera.  You can animate the camera position and rotation, FOV, and post process settings.
* They can be created in the Content Browser, you can convert a track in Matinee to one, or you can import keyframes from external tools like Maya


![](cameraAnims.png)(w:935)

* To edit a **CameraAnim**, simply double click the asset in the Content Browser like you would any other asset. The CameraAnim editor is slightly customized version of Matinee.  
* Multiple **CameraAnimInsts** (up to 8 currently) can be active at once, all blending and contributing to the final camera settings.

#### New: User-Defined Structures for Blueprints
**User Defined Structures** are a brand new asset that is now available for use from within the editor! 
* A **User Defined Structure** can be created in the **Content Browser**. 

![](newStruct.png)

They can be edited in the standalone editor by double clicking them in the **Content Browser**. Once you are done editing them, you can create a variable of a type of your new User Defined Structure in your Blueprints.

![](stucts.png)(w:935)

* Like vectors, rotators, and other structures, your **User Defined Structure** will have **Make** and **Break** nodes.
	**User Defined Structures** should behave like native structures::USTRUCT(BlueprintType).

#### New: Blueprint Function Library
Users can now create a blueprint function library asset!  This allows you to create a nice library of Blueprint functions that can be used throughout your project!

![](blueprintFunctions.png)

Unlike the Blueprint Macro Library, Blueprint Function Libraries don't require a Parent Class, and are able to be called by all Blueprints in the current project.

#### New: Canvas Render Targets
-	You can now draw Canvas UI straight to a texture, and then map that texture to objects in your scene! 
-	This is currently only supported in C++.
-	A special thanks to community member James Tan for submitting this.

#### New: Vehicle Template
We have a new project template that gives a simple automobile to start your new vehicle-based project with.  Both Blueprint and C++ versions of this template are available now!

[REGION:fullwidth]
![](VechicleTemp.png)
[/REGION]

#### New: FABRIK Inverse Kinematics Solver
**FABRIK** stands for Forward And Backward Reaching Inverse Kinematic. It is an IK solver that works on a chain of bones of any arbitrary length!

![](FABRIK.png)

* End Effector settings are the same as our TwoBone_IK node. It can be an absolute Transform, or a relative one (based on another bone from the same Skeleton).
* In the Solver section, you define the chain of bones to use, from the 'Root' to the 'Tip'. The 'Tip' will try to reach the end effector location.
* End Effector Rotation Source allows you to control the rotation (maintain component space, local space, match end effector target rotation).
* Precision is how close it needs to get. The lower, the more precise it gets to the End Effector Target, but the more expensive. (Although from tests it does a really nice job, and much quicker than the CCD_IK node).
* MaxIterations is there to control performance, and make sure edge cases will not take frame rate down.

Thanks to GitHub community member Stephen Whittle for this feature!

#### New: Animation Blueprint Asset Override Editor
Persona now has the ability to override the assets used in **Play** and **Evaluate** nodes in parent animation blueprints from a child blueprint. 

The editor for this can be found in the **Window menu** in Persona:

![](assetOverride.png)

The editor collects all of the nodes that can have their animation asset overridden. New assets can be picked from the pickers on the right of the panel. This works with longer inheritance chains too and shows the most appropriate defaults for that blueprint based upon the blueprints further up in the hierarchy. Finally, the "eye" button will link you to the AnimGraph node you are overriding: 

![](assetOverride03.png)

#### New: Experimental Math Expression Node for Blueprints
There is a new experimental plugin available for the Math Expression Node for Blueprints. This node enables you to simply type in an expression and it will make the input pins, output pins, and a collapsed graph that contains your math expression.

![](mathExpNode.png)

* To use this node, simply activate the **Math Expression** plugin in the plugin manager. It will then appear in the right-click context menu of the Blueprint Graph Editor.
* Once created, type in your expression. If you make a mistake, you can edit the expression by renaming the node.


#### New: Improved Anim Notify Editor
Multi-select support for **Anim Notifies** has been added into Persona! **Shift + click** adds to selection, and **Ctrl + click** toggles a notify selection.

You can drag the selection around and it will remain within the notify panel while obeying snaps:

![](animNotify1.png)

Copy/Paste works with groups too with a number of options: 

![](animNotify2.png)

* You can paste them at the absolute, relative, or original time, in relation from where they were copied.

#### New: Blueprint Cut and Paste for Components
Cut/Copy/Paste commands have now been added to Components mode!

![](CopyandPasteBlueprint01.png)

* Select individual components and either right-click or use keyboard Cut/Paste commands to copy or move components around!
	
* You can cut/copy components from one Blueprint and paste them right into another Blueprint!

	If the selection includes a hierarchy, it will be preserved in the pasted copy!


#### New: UV Parallax for SplineThicken Material Function
You can now add UV parallax to materials using the SplineThicken Material Function. This makes it look like your object is round! 

![](spline1.png) ![](spine2.png)

* The normals part of the function has been re-touched and they are now transforming correctly for all object rotations. This gives accurate lighting and specular!
	
New inputs:
* **UVs for Thickness (V2)**: This lets you specify a different UV channel for storing the thickness (tip to base) gradient. Useful to have this on UV1 or 2 for trees where there might be an overall tree length included,included not just a single pipe or branch etc.
* **UVs for Texturing (V2)**: This is the UVs for any textures you want applied to the pipe. You need to include and scale math here so it knows how much to parallax by. This is only needed if you want the 3D parallax correction results.
* **DeriveNormalZ (Bool)**: When checked, the shader will use DeriveNormalZ to compute the height of the normal. Gives much nicer 'round' shape. When false, 0.62 is assumed which is the average height of half a sphere centered at 0. If you want to use CustomUVs to solve the normal, you either need DeriveNormalZ to be false, or you need a row of vertices in the center of the spline mesh. If you do not have the added verts and use CustomUVs, it will say the normal has 0 height across the entire mesh.
* **AngleCorrectedNormals (Bool)**: Whether to use angle corrected normals when applying the additional normal texture. More accurate but more expensive.
* **AdditionalNormal (V3)**: Lets you specify an additional normalmap that will piggyback onto the vertexnormal transformation. 
	
New output:
* **UVs with Parallax**: This gives the UVs to use for any textures you want to have the 3d parallax.
	
	Currently the function only handles 1 texture coordinate, so if you want multiple textures to have the correction, they all need to use the same scale.

#### New: Animation Debug Features
There are a number of new Animation Debug commands at your disposal. First there is in game rendering of a skeletal mesh's bones:

![](animDebug1.png)

This is enabled using the **ShowDebug Bones** console command. As seen above the bones are represented by individual white lines. 
* An alternative look, matching the bones displayed in Persona, can be enabled via the **ShowDebugToggleSubCategory** 3DBones console command.
* Next is the animation debug output, which can be enabled using the **ShowDebug Animation** console command.

![](AnimationDebug02.png)

* This is split up into 5 sections, each of which can be toggled on and off using the **ShowDebugToggleSubCategory** command followed by the category name listed below e.g. ShowDebugToggleSubCategory SyncGroups
	* **SyncGroups**: Displays the animation assets currently contributing to the final pose, organised by their sync group (or Ungrouped if they don't belong to a group). By default Blendspaces listed in this section show all their contributing animations / weights. To reduce screen space used by the output this can be toggled off with ShowDebugToggleSubCategory **FullBlendspaceDisplay**.
	* **Montages**: Lists the montages currently being used by the character. The active montage is highlighted in green.
	* **Curves**: List the curve values (in Name: Value pairs) that have been activated by the playing animation(s).
	* **Notifies**: Display any notify states that are currently in effect.
	* **Graph**: Displays the active pose graph. The display starts with the last node (the root node) which represents the final pose and goes on to list all the nodes that go into making that final pose. Nodes are represented in such a way as to keep their hierarchy, allowing the user to see which nodes are connected to what without having to refer to the original blueprint asset. Active nodes are coloured green and (if they have been toggled to display using **ShowDebugToggleSubCategory FullGraph** ) inactive nodes are coloured grey.




#### New: Level Viewport Stats
Many useful engine stats can be visualized over the viewport. You can now access these using the new "Stat" section under the viewport "Show" menu.

![](ViewportStats.png)

* You can also toggle most of these stats by typing "Stat <name>" into a debug console prompt.  
* By default the stats are not remembered between sessions, but you can turn that on by enabling "Save Engine Stats" in the editor's Viewport preferences section.




#### New: OBJ Mesh File Format Support
You can now import .obj files for static meshes!
The file format is very simple so keep in mind that it does not support the following features:
* Vertex color importing.
* Collision importing.
* Tangent and Bbinormal importing.
* Transforms.
* The model will be rotated if not modeled with Z up because with OBJ importing we have no way of getting the source coordinate system.

#### New: Upgraded FBX to 2014
The FBX importer as now been upgraded to the 2014 version from Autodesk.  
* This allows Tangent and binormals on mirrored meshes to be imported correctly
* You can still use the earlier FBX plugins found in any Maya/Max version before 2014, but you may get a warning on import when using a very old file.


#### New: Windows XP Support (preview)
Developers working out of GitHub now have the ability to deploy your project to Windows XP.
* To enable this, set WindowsPlatform.SupportWindowsXP to true in UnrealBuildTool, and edit your project's settings to enable OpenGL shader support.
* When running on Windows XP, OpenGL is automatically used instead of DirectX 11 for rendering 
* This feature is early in development and will be improved over time.


#### New: Improved Blueprint Support for Actor Destruction
In the 4.2 Preview Notes it was listed that the EndPlay event would replace the Destroyed event in Blueprints, this is no longer the case for 4.2.
* In Blueprints, the new Event EndPlay node will eventually replace the Event Destroyed. The Event EndPlay node should be used going forward.
* EndPlay will not just fire when an Actor is explicitly destroyed, but will also execute anytime an Actor ceases to be in the World.  This includes a level transition, a streaming level being unloaded, a PIE session ending, or Destroy being called for an Actor
* Also, the EndPlay node now gives the reason for it executing (Actor Destroyed, Level Transition, the end of Play in Editor, and Removed from World)
* In C++, the AActor::Destroyed virtual function remains, however it is primarily intended for editor transaction purposes.
* The C++ AActor::EndPlay virtual function takes an enumeration parameter indicating the reason the Actor has been removed from the World.
* The AActor::OnRemoveFromWorld virtual function, previously called for each Actor when the streaming level they belong to was unloaded, has been removed and its functionality included in AActor::EndPlay.

**Material Editor**
* New: **Release Stats** and **Built-In Stats** toolbar buttons now have icons.
* **Built-in Stats** - These stats show the base cost of a shader without any nodes in the graph.
* **Release Stats** - These stats show the base cost of a shader without any nodes in the graph. 
* New: Added Find Results tab to Material Editor.
* New: Added shortcut for component mask on **Shift+C**.

**Texture Editor**
* Changed the Use **Specified Mip Level** property (**bUseSpecifiedMipLevel**) to now default to false, and the number of cinematic mips is ignored by the UI when it's true.

**Persona**
* Changed the default and details inspectors so they are now disabled when editing a read only graph.

###API Changes

#### Editor and Tools
* Improvements to the blueprint compiler pipeline to allow new compilers to be registered with the Kismet module.
* Limited the game name length (20 characters), and predict the cooking path length and limit the naming length accordingly.
* Removed UEditorEngine::GetContentBrowserAssetTreePath.
* Removed the experimental **SlateComponentWrappers** module.

#### Gameplay and Framework
* New: **Can Jump** is now exposed in **ACharacter** to be overridden by Blueprints.
* New: Add Character::OnWalkingOffLedge() event.
	* Makes it easier to detect transition from walking -> falling, exclusive of jumping or other things that may cause the same transition in movement modes.
* New: Added "hold-to-jump-higher" functionality to **ACharacter**.
* Changed the **Match** state machine in **GameMode** to be explicit and based on the **MatchState** namespace, as opposed to being based on a set of bools. Renamed several functions in GameState and GameSession as well, if you have a native subclass you may need to rename functions. Here are the states and how things changed:
	* **EnteringMap** is the initial state. Actors are not yet ticking and the world hasn't been fully initialized. It will transition to the next state when things are fully loaded.
	* **WaitingToStart** (was **bWaitingToStartMatch**) is the next state, and **HandleMatchIsWaitingToStart** is called when entering. Actors are ticking, but players have not yet spawned in. It transitions to the next state if **ReadyToStartMatch** returns true, or if someone calls **StartMatch**.
	* **InProgress** (was **bMatchIsInProgress**) is the next state, and HandleMatchHasStarted (split off from **StartMatch**) is called when entering, which calls **BeginPlay** on all actors. Normal gameplay is in progress. It transitions to the next state if **ReadyToEndMatch** returns true, or if someone calls **EndMatch**.
	* **WaitingPostMatch** is the next state, and **HandleMatchHasEnded** (was **PerformEndGameHandling**) is called when entering. Actors are still ticking but new players are not accepted. It transitions to the next state when a map transfer starts.
	* **LeavingMap** (was **bLevelChange**) is the last state, and HandleLeavingMap (was GameEnding) is called when entering. The match stays in this state while transfering to a new map.
	* Aborted is the failure state, started from AbortMatch. This is set when there is an unrecoverable error.
* Changed **AGameMode::bDelayedStart** into a new flag, **bStartPlayersAsSpectators**. If true, new players will initially spawn as spectators, if false they'll spawn directly as pawns. **bDelayedStart** now only affects rather the match should start immediately.
* Changed the maximum number of Physics Material Surface Types to 64.
* Changed FCoreDelegates::OnObjectPropertyChanged to take the property change event as an additional parameter.
* Changed **AActor::BeginPlay** to now happen earlier in some situations. It happens when the game state transitions to **WaitingToStart** or **InProgress** for the first time, previously it only happened when the match started. Renamed functions so **UWorld::BeginPlay** is what calls **AActor::BeginPlay**.
* Moved Blackboard Component's reference over from BehaviorTreeComponent to BrainComponent.
* Renamed Nav Movement Component's GetActorLocation to more appropriate GetActorFeetLocation.
* Changed the preview attached asset type from raw pointer to **TAssetPtr**.
* Changed the signature of **FAssetTools::CreateDiffProcess()** to take filepaths explicitly as separate params.
	* Adds abstraction between the public API and the diff provider. API no longer exposes the diff command line format.
* Updated **FAssetTools::CreateDiffProcess**. Any uses of will need to have the filenames removed from the arguments and passed in though the new New and Old filename variables.
* Fixed Stationary mobility from showing up on anything except subclasses of **ULightComponentBase**.
* Fixed **FCoreStyle** initializing and failing per file when all of its assets are missing (Saves 1-2 seconds of load time on iPhone4 for games that don't use Slate).
* Removed the obsolete 'Z' parameter in **UCanvas::DrawTile()**.

#### Core
* New: Licensee Engine Version support (Changelist part).
	* Modified **UpdateLocalVersion** UAT script to be able to set licensee versions and custom change lists.
* New: **TWeakPtr<Base>** is now comparable with **TWeakPtr<Derived>** and all **TWeakPtrs** are now comparable with **nullptr**.
* New: **TArrays** can now be copied with an ExtraSlack parameter to reserve space after the copied elements.
* New: Additional **FString** functionality:
	* **AppendChars** can take a character count to allow the use of not-null-terminated strings or partial strings.
	* const TCHAR* + **FString** operator.
	* More **rvalue** awareness.
* New: **UnrealHeaderTool** now handles #ifdef/#ifndef/#elif/#else directives.
	* Contents of these blocks are skipped in their entirety by UHT - it's not proper support, but will allow more native code to compile.
* Changed the build system to now take care of building generated code.
	* *.generated.inl files no longer needed to be included by users.
	* Including a .generated.inl file will now issue a compiler warning to remove the include.
	* In a future engine release, the .generated.inl which warns will be removed entirely and the #include will fail.
	* New: Delegates and multicast delegates now support UFunction bindings.
	* Combined SetObject() and SetFunctionName(), on script delegates, into BindUFunction().
	* Updated TWeakObjPtr to now have proper assignment operators, so that explicit boxing of UObject values is no longer necessary.
	* Refactored GIsBenchamrking, GUseFixedTimeStep to FApp::IsBenchmarking and FApp::UseFixedTimeStep respectively.
* **FCrc::StrCrc32** no longer warns when instantiated with a 1-byte character type.
* **FString** constructor with **ExtraSlack** no longer reads off the end of the source string.
* **FString::Replace** no longer mutates the const source string (thread safety issue).
* Files without BOMs are now treated as UTF-8 rather than just ANSI.
* TSharedPtr, TWeakPtr and TSharedRef are now move-aware.
* Build times improved in functions containing lots of **TSharedPtr** assignments.
* Renamed assets referenced by Blueprint CDOs no longer incorrectly warn about being referenced by code.
* You can now change a **UProperty** of a raw pointer type to a **TAssetPtr** and the property will be fixed up while serializing tagged properties.
* Added some documentation to the **SpawnParameters** fields Refactored relevant Blueprints to have frame independent turn/look Fixed and issue in **APawn::EnableInput** Fixed a bug in strategy game minimap Reinstated rocket launcher (and ammo) in shootergame sample.
* Updated infrastructure to support showing World assets in the Content Browser and generally tread worlds as normal assets.
* Added **EWorldType::Inactive** to represent worlds that are loaded but not currently being edited in the level editor.
* **UBrush** objects corresponding to the default brush are now saved with the same outer as the default brush, instead of top-level objects in world packages

#### Slate
* New: The Slate Remote server (for UDK Remote iOS app) is now a plug-in (enabled by default).
* New: The Slate module has been split into Slate and SlateCore in preparation for UMG. Detailed upgrade notes for this change:
	* If your module previously had a module dependency to 'Slate', it now also needs a PrivateModuleDependency to 'SlateCore' in its Build.cs file.
	* If your module exposes in any of its Public header files types that are now declared in SlateCore, it needs a PublicModuleDependency to 'SlateCore'.
	* The ToolTip property type on SWidget has changed from SToolTip to IToolTip; change local variables to TSharedPtr<IToolTip> instead of TSharedPtr<SToolTip> where needed
	* IToolTip is not a widget. If you need access to the actual widget that represents the tool tip, use IToolTip::AsWidget(); If you need access to the tool tip's content, use IToolTip::GetContentWidget().
	* After syncing to this changelist you may have to clean your /Engine/Intermediate/Build/ directory and rebuild your entire project.
	* If in your project you are getting linker errors for unresolved types that are now declared in SlateCore, you may be missing a dependency to 'SlateCore'.
	* If in the Engine code you are getting linker errors for unresolved types that are now declared in SlateCore, you may need to rebuild the entire Engine.
	* Updated the directory layouts for Slate and SlateCore modules for better discoverability.
* Fixed morphtarget not playing in matinee.
* Fixed the bug with losing collision settings when copying objects for custom settings.

#### Rendering
* New: **StreamingPauseRendering** allows some rendering to continue while blocking loads complete so that the game does not appear to hang. Default is to display the previous frame with an animated widget in the corner. This can be overridden by providing a custom **BeginStreamingPauseDelegate** and **EndStreamingPauseDelegate**.

#### Blueprints
* New: Added UK2Node_LatentOnlineCall which automatically creates entries for all static factory methods in UOnlineBlueprintCallProxyBase subclasses.
* In **UK2Node** sub-classes, in **ExpandNode()**, users should now use the CompilerContext's **MovePinLinksToIntermediate/CopyPinLinksToIntermediate** instead of the schema's Move/CopyPinLinks.
* A runtime check() will be triggered if users fail to do so. This is to facilitate more accurate Blueprint debugging. It allows us to easily map generated pins to ones the Blueprint user sees in the graph.
* Updated **UK2Node_BaseAsyncTask**, making it much easier to extend.

#### UnrealHeaderTool
* HeaderGroup keyword has been removed as well as all header group generated headers.
* Any UCLASS declarations using HeaderGroup keyword need to be fixed (keyword has to be removed).
* All #includes to HeaderGroupNameClasses.h generated headers in licensee code need to be removed otherwise code will not compile.

#### Platforms

**iOS**
* iOS on PC will build content only projects entirely on PC, but now requires users to add their developer certificate to the PC. This can be done with IPP.
* Prevented delayed success adverts from being shown if they succeed after the app has requested hiding them.
* Fixed various threading / logic issues in the iOS achievements implementation.

**Xbox One**
* May 2014 XDK is now supported.
