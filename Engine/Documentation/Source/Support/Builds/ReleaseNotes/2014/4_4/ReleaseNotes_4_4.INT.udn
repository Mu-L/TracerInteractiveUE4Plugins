Unreal Engine 4.4 has our first preview release of Unreal Motion Graphics, our new UI design and scripting toolset.  Also in this version Behavior Tree Editor, our AI logic tool, is enabled by default and ready for everyone to use!  You'll also see many improvements to the Persona Animation Editor and Paper 2D.  Support for Android and iOS platforms is even better now, and C++ compiling is faster too.  Many new Marketplace releases are ready for 4.4!  We're shipping the Landscape Mountains sample, Matinee Fight Scene, Mixamo Animation Pack, and new Content Example maps for Paper 2D and Networking.  Be sure to hit up the Marketplace to grab these new samples - they are free to subscribers.

## Major New Features

#### New: Unreal Motion Graphics (UI Editor Preview)
Unreal Motion Graphics (UMG) is our experimental new interactive UI design and scripting tool!

![](UTMainMenuMockup01.png)

The new Widget Editor tool lets you layout UI on an interactive canvas and create and preview animations in real-time. UMG integrates deeply with Blueprints, so you can easily wire up events to trigger gameplay changes. UMG is built on top of the Slate UI system and inherits many awesome benefits such as a large array of UI widgets and a rich set of features.

Unreal Motion Graphics is currently 'Experimental' as of the 4.4 release. It is not fully production-ready and things may not be backwards compatible, but we would love for you to check it out and send feedback! To access UMG, enable it in the Experimental section of the Editor Preferences.

For more info, please check out our [UMG Documentation for 4.4](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?25533-UMG-Documentation-for-4-4-Preview) and our [demostration video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FaBJYFhP5yo&feature=youtu.be&t=9m49s).

## Free Marketplace Content

Check out just how easy it is to create a high-end realistic landscape with beautiful mountain ranges using UE4 and Landscape Mountains!

![](LandScapeMountains.png)

**Matinee Fight Scene** - Learn how to create stunning cinematics just like the pros by digging into this fight scene built with Matinee. From animated characters to VFX, you'll go hands on to see how everything is controlled within the Editor. Get started with our [tutorial](Resources/Showcases/MatineeFightScene) and some simple Matinee [how-to's](Engine/Matinee/HowTo).

![](MatineeFightScene.png)

**Mixamo Animation Pack** - Mixamo brings you a free Character and Animation Pack for use in your project. Containing 15 characters with animations, prototyping your game has never been easier!

![](Mixamo.png)

**New Paper2D Content Example Map** - Covers several topics related to 2D game creation including: Sprite creation and editing via the Sprite Editor, Flipbooks which enable you to create animated 2D assets using Sprites and keyframing, how to control Flipbooks with Blueprints, adding physics to 2D assets, and how to create the classic low resolution pixel look for your Sprites. Check out the companion [Paper2D documenatation](Resources/ContentExamples/Paper2D) for more info!

![](Paper2DExamplePic.png)

**New Networking Features Content Example Map** - Illustrates how to implement network functionality entirely through Blueprints. The examples in the Replication section showcase the methods of properly communicating information between Server and Client as well as when to employ the different techniques. The examples shown in the Relevancy section demonstrate how to handle cases where an Actor becomes relevant, such as when a player joins an existing game in-progress. Browse the [documentation](Resources/ContentExamples/Networking) while you go!

![](NetworkingFeatureContentMap.png)

#### Behavior Tree

##### New: Behavior Tree Editor is now ready to use!

![](BehaviorTreeMainPic.png)(w:900)

Behavior Tree Editor allows you to edit AI state logic in an interactive graph editor.  We've been making steady improvements to the tool for months now, and we think it's ready for everyone to use in their games!  

**Execution Order Indicators**
 
Nodes now have indicators to show the order in which they will be executed within their parent scope. Hovering over these indicators also highlights indicators at the same level in the tree:

![](BehaviorTree01.png)

When debugging, the indicators display the overall order within the tree:

![](BehaviorTree02.png)

**Node Tooltips**
 
All built-in nodes now have tooltips explaining their functionality. Hover over a node to see what it does.

![](BehaviorTree03.png)

#### Materials

##### New: Clear Coat Shading Model! 
The new **Clear Coat** shading model makes it easier to design materials that have a translucent coating on top.

![](ClearCoat01.png)	
*(note the flecks were done in the material editor and are not part of the shading model)*

This can be used for multilayer materials where a translucent layer of film is over the surface of a standard material, either a metal or nonmetal. Specifically it was designed to model this second class of smooth colored films over a non-colored metal.

Examples included acrylic or lacquer clear coats, and colored films over metals such as soda cans and car paint.

Two new parameters are exposed:
* **Clear Coat**.  Amount of clear coat layer, 0 acts like the standard shading model, 1 is the full clear coat model. This is useful for masking.

* **Clear Coat Roughness**.  Roughness for the clear coat layer. Our approximation is accurate for small values. Very rough clear coat layers are supported but won't be very accurate to their real world counterparts.

##### New: Tube Lights
Thanks to a great [community submission](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?5670-Capsule-light-functionality-added-in-lightmass&p=41896#post41896), the Lightmass raytracer now supports capsule-shaped point lights.

![](TubelightLightmass.png)

#### Paper 2D

##### Paper 2D Sprite Dicing
Paper 2D Sprites can now be diced! 

Paper 2D Sprites can now be diced!   This separates out translucent/masked regions from opaque ones, reducing the GPU cost of rendering them. 

To use this feature, set the render geometry type to Diced and make sure that you have the alternate material set to an opaque material on the asset.

![](SpriteDicingPaper2D.png)


#### Persona

##### Improved Animation Editing Workflow! 

* **Streamlined Persona UI**.  We've Improved and simplified the layouts for every single mode in Persona. 

![](SimplifiedTabs.png)

* **New toolbars**!  Each mode in Persona now has a toolbar containing commonly used operations.

![](PersonaToolbars.png)
![](PersonaToolbars2.png)

* **Animation Thumbnails**.  Your animations now display beautiful thumbnails in the Content Browser!

![](AnimationThumbnail.png)

* **Animation auto-preview**.  You can now preview animation sequences by hovering over the asset in the Asset Browser. 

![](PreviewTooltip.png)

* **Save All Animations**.  Added the ability to "Save all Animation Assets" to the File menu in Persona.

![](SaveAllAnimations.png)

* **Select Hidden Bones**.  You can now select a bone in the viewport when it's hidden (mesh must have a physics asset).

![](SelectBoneHidden.png)

* **Inline Help Links**.  You can now easily "jump to documentation" for each animation editor type using the new help links to the right

![](MontageErrorMessage.png)

* **Mesh LOD View**.  Mesh Detail View now displays LOD settings, including the materials for each LOD. 

![](MeshDetailView.png)

* **Animation Import Help**.  Any errors that occur while importing animations from FBX files will now have detailed help descriptions in the Message Log.

![](FBXImporting.png)

* **Shift+Click** can now be used to expand/collapse hierarchies in the Skeleton Tree.
* The Display Info in the Persona viewport has now been simplified to only show essential information.
* A helpful error message now displays when an invalid name is used for a Montage slot.
* Animation "Retargeting" option is now only shown in the Skeleton Tab.
* The zoom feature in the Animation Editor now zooms in based on current mouse position.
* Finally, all AnimGraph nodes that reference assets now support **double-clicking** to open the asset for editing. 

#### Blueprints

##### NewBlueprint Node: Set Members in Structure
This node lets you easily assign values to variables in your user-defined structure. You can select which struct variables are displayed using the node's Details.

![](BlueprintSetMembers.png)

##### New Blueprint Node: Set Timer Delegate

This node makes it easy to run a custom event at a specific interval of your choosing.  You can optionally tell the event to be called repeatedly using the "Looping" check box.

![](BlueprintSetTimer.png)

#### Platform Improvements
A huge number of improvements have been made to mobile workflows, including in-editor tutorials to help with device provisioning.  New graphics features are available on mobile, such as instanced foliage. The Mac version of Unreal Editor is now more responsive, has an improved menu experience, and dozens of other changes.  Android supports even more devices, and you can now access in-app purchase features from your Blueprint scripts!

See the rest of the changelist below for a detailed list of improvements for your favorite platforms!


#### Editor

##### New: Snap Actors to Surfaces! 
There is a new button on the transform toolbar which allows you to project actors into the world as you drag them. This can be really useful for placing objects onto complex geometry.

![](SnapActors01.png)

The snapping works in one of two ways, either by projecting through the drag plane (if you are dragging in a constrained plane), or by projecting the actors into the world in screen space (when dragging in all 3 axes).

![](SnapActors04.png)

#### Physics

##### New: Simple 2D Physics Constraints! 
The engine now supports easily constraining 3D physics objects into a 2D plane. This should help with 3D side scrollers.

![](2DphysicsConstraints.png)

The setting can be applied per object, or project wide by changing the project physics settings.
 
Ragdolls will by default only constrain the root body. This allows limbs of the ragdoll to move in 3D, while still keeping the entire asset in a 2D plane.

##### New: Custom Friction Modes
Physical Materials now support different friction modes!

![](FrictionModeCustom.png)

By default we take the average friction coefficient when two bodies hit. However, this can be problematic for cases like ice where negative and positive coefficients are needed to average out to 0.
 
Different modes are useful for different types of effects. In the case of ice you would likely want either Multiply or Min with the ice material's friction set to 0.
 
The friction mode can be set project wide or overwritten per physical material.

* Fixed custom navlink ID assignment for static navmesh (without rebuild at runtime).
* Fixed inconsistent navmesh generation from sublevel's geometry.
* Fixed navigation relevancy update not being propagated from child components.
* Fixed bug in ribbons that would break spawning with other particles as their source.
* Fixed a crash in the Content Browser when dragging the root folder.
* Fixed issues with '/' and '\' being allowed in project name when creating new project.
* Content Browser: Moving all parent folders to child folders is now disallowed.
* Fixed an issue with user default array serialization in Editor Preferences which caused duplicated values in the UI.
* Fixed an issue where resetting Selection Color (and probably other properties) to default in the Editor Preferences would not update the UI or viewport until the editor was restarted.
* Fixed visibility tool not showing the visibility layer as its target.

**Landscape**
* New: Added Landscape actor icon in scene outliner.
* New: Added manual rotation option to Landscape editor alpha brush.
* New: Support exporting terrain with holes to FBX meshes.
* ALandscapeProxy::DataLayer has been renamed to VisibilityLayer.
* FLandscapeToolSet has been removed.

#### Blueprints
* New: Can now create BP variables for types that directly inherit from UObject.
* New: Added BP-callable accessors for spline mesh component values.
* New: Decal sort order can now be set via Blueprints using SetSortOrder.
* New: Added a Blueprint log warning for BPs that are migrated during map loads so problems between stale BPs and maps can be detected more easily. It also adds an editor option under the main editor save\load preferences to mark any migrated BPs as dirty in an attempt to aid migration problem resolution caused by maps that have been saved after BPs have been migrated but the BPs have not been saved.
* New: Can now deprecate BPs using the Blueprint properties.
* New: Enabled dynamic class loading in the class picker dialog. 
* New: Patched an issue where item expansion states in the dialog were not preserved when a dynamic load occurred.
* New: Functions and macros now display their category in the My Blueprint panel.
* New: It is now possible to set a default scale for actor-based Blueprints by editing the root component's scale in Components mode within the Blueprint editor.
* New: Added new tooltip text using tooltip metadata from C++ node classes and BlueprintDescription text for BP node classes.
* New: Added new widget overlay system for graph panels, designed to allow more flexibility than the current brush-only implementation.
* New: The name collision detection code is now more aggressive when duplicating curves/timelines to prevent a problem where duplicate names could emerge and cause asserts.
* New: Old widget BPs should load in 4.4, but several properties will likely be reset to their defaults.
* New: This release introduces the ability to mark a Blueprint custom event as a utility function that can be called on actors in the editor.
	* The idea is to provide the flexibility of Blueprints to perform management/peripheral tasks on actors or even just to provide a form of in editor preview on Blueprint functionality.
	* Custom event functions can be marked as being available to this functionality by ticking on Call In Editor in the Blueprint details panel. The UI to call the function is located in the main details panel in the Blutility section, and is populated from the currently selected actor Blueprint.
* New: Undo/Redo support for deleting unused variables.
* Blueprint overlap queries also check async scene.
	* Blueprint scene queries already check both sync and async scenes. It turns out the overlap query for Blueprint was not doing this. We've fixed this, but it's possible some behavior will break if you're relying on the old inconsistent behavior.
* Modified the Blueprint details panel to mark the Blueprint as dirty when changing a custom event's replication setting.
* Redressed a regression in the Blueprint editor in which shortcut keys became disabled after selecting nodes.
* Type coercion now works off all wildcard pins in call array function nodes, not just the Target Array pin.
* Replaced the placeholder icon for the call in editor events with the final version.
* Removed macro libraries from the variable type dropdown in the Blueprint editor.
* Removed FUNC_Exec flag from all Blueprint-generated functions. This prevents some functions from being called by simply typing their name in the console.  If you'd like to directly call an event from the console, please use the following syntax: ke * MyEvent, or replace the * with the name of the instance you want to call the event on.
* Fixed infinite loops in Blueprint code repeatedly spamming alert boxes.
* Fixed enum node load issue, that was causing the enum to become unselected after reloading.
* Fixed Blueprint circular dependency issues (issues where one Blueprint relies on another that references that original blueprint).
* Fixed an ordering issue with rerunning Blueprint construction scripts which was breaking attachments on level load.
* Fixed constant values as input to SpawnActorFromClass and AddComponent nodes, can now be assigned without creating a variable in your blueprint.
* Fixed crash that could occur when collapsing and subsequently expanding nodes that included functions or other collapsed graphs.
* Fixed crash that could occur when loading Blueprints that had soft circular dependencies.

#### Rendering
* New: Major progress toward parallelized renderer (can be previewed with 'r.RHICmdBypass 0' console command.)
* New: Added rich tooltips to material nodes!
* New: Added compression and sampler types for distance field fonts.
* New: Added option to TextRenderActor that allows text to render unmodified when using debug visualization modes such as Level Coloration. This tickbox is located under the Rendering category in the details panel and is called Always Render As Text.
* New: Added exports to various texture classes to allow subclassing in different modules.
* New: Added Texture property to change maximum resolution limitation (MaxTextureSize in Compression section, Advanced view). This is useful especially for HDR cubemap, which is limited by 512 (hardcoded for performance).
* New: Changed default rotation for SpawnDecalAtLocation to point downwards.
* New: Skylight LightColor and Intensity can be animated by Matinee now.
* Cascade Mesh emitter improvements
	* Mesh emitters that don't use PSA_Velocity or PSA_AwayFromCenter had their rotation rate increase over time, ending up with them spinning uncontrollably after a few seconds, and order of operations between 
	* Orientation and Scaling of particles wasn't as expected. These problems are fixed with this update.
	* Additionally, MediumDetailSpawnRateScale has been deprecated and replaced with QualityLevelSpawnRateScale. This new value is tied to the scalability settings' effects quality level, and results in the spawn rate being multiplied by QualityLevelSpawnRateScale for every reduction of effects quality level from Epic. For example, if an emitter's spawn rate is authored to 100, and its QualityLevelSpawnRateScale is 0.5, reducing effects quality to High will result in a spawn rate of 50, going to Medium will set spawn rate to 25. Setting QualityLevelSpawnRateScale to 1.0 results in no change across effects quality changes.
* Particle effect meshes now adhere to the view mode correctly
* Beams now pass in a second UV set which covers 0 to 1 in U across the length of the beam. UV set 0 now tiles according to the tiling parameters in the typedata module.
* Fixed issue where turning on GBuffer Hints in the main viewport crashes the Editor.
* Extensibility: UMaterialBillboardComponent class is now exposed via ENGINE_API.
* Batched meshes are now cleared when flushing line batchers.
* Changing an MID's blend mode to masked now works correctly.
* Moved the blend separate ARB functions to optional. Added extension check for the GL_ARB_draw_buffers_blend string.
* Fixed negative colors from SkyLight computations in base pass.
* Fixed compilation error for materials using world space normals and refraction.
* Fixed issue where adding a tessellated material to a landscape was causing heavy spiking. 
* Fixed Distance Field AO with cameras that constrain aspect ratio

#### Gameplay and Framework
* New: Added GameMenuBuilder module for quick creation of simple menus.
* New: Added functions to detect if a mouse is connected during runtime.
* New: Added shadow option to debug text and cleaned up the DrawText function in HUD.
* New: Added new functions GetInstanceTransform, UpdateInstanceTransform, GetInstanceCount, RemoveInstance and SetCullDistances to InstancedStaticMeshComponent. These are also callable from Blueprints.
* New: Added latent Blueprint node that allows dynamic manipulation of force feedback based on game events.
* New: Added possibility to log histogram-like data to visual logger and extended LogVisualizer tool to display that data as 2D graphs onscreen.
* New: Added support for tutorials to be able to open IDE at a given line.
* New: Added support for tutorials so they can open or highlight an asset.
* New: Added support to change the filter on an asset picker after it has been created.
* New: Added support for setting object properties by FAssetData via PropertyHandles.
* New: Added CameraActor 'AutoActivateForPlayer' option, so cameras placed in a level can automatically be linked to a PlayerController.
	* Added Blueprint events for Actors when they start and stop being the viewtarget for a PlayerController (OnBecomeViewTarget / OnEndViewTarget).
	* Native C++ events for these (BecomeViewTarget / EndViewTarget) already existed and now trigger the BP events.
	* Changed the order of calls to EndViewTarget / BecomeViewTarget from the PlayerCameraManager, so that the End event occurs first on the old target, followed by the Begin event for the new one (previously it was reversed).
* New: Allowed static components to move during RerunConstructionScripts for a level that has not been fully added to the world, and add threshold to position/rotation equality checks to prevent unneeded updates to component position.
* New: Any previous scale value other than (1,1,1) that was set on "non-native" root components (i.e. not created in C++) will be auto-reverted back to (1,1,1) on load.
	* Previously, the default scale value for non-native root components was being ignored at construction time.
	* As a result, we're implicitly reverting those values on load to ensure that both existing instances and new instances will continue to appear at the same scale as they did prior to the update.
* New: Bind functions for Axis, AxisKey, and VectorAxis added to InputComponent that do not take a delegate to facilitate binding the axis for the purposes of using get value functions.
* New: Created tutorial for Blueprint-based first-person template. 
* New: Created tutorial for code-based Rolling template. 
* New: Characters walking on SkeletalMeshComponents now maintain relative position and rotation to the bone they're standing on, moving over animated bones rather than staying in place relative to mesh origin.
* New: Dynamic parameters now copy their parameter names from pre-existing dynamic parameters.
* New: Editing transform defaults in "Components" mode within the Blueprint editor has been slightly changed.
	* Previously, location, rotation and scale were all exposed, but only for the default scene root as well as for any root component created in Components mode.
	* After the update, location and rotation are now hidden, and scale is now exposed for both "native" (i.e. created in C++) and "non-native" root components.
* New: Force feedback now supported on PC for XInput devices.
* New: Force feedback can now be disabled via the PlayerController.
* New: Full-size screenshots are now displayed in a resizable window.
* New: Get Display Name now available in Blueprints for class variables.
* New: InstancedStaticMeshComponents now set the FHitResult.Item property with the index an instance hit by a collision event. This can be used with the above functions to remove a specific instance and replace it with a real StaticMeshComponent to provide interactivity with Foliage or other behavior.
* New: Introduced UNavigationPath for BP usage - not much one can do with it just yet.
* New: Instigator can now be set as part of Spawn Actor Blueprint node.  If the Instigator is not explicitly set via a wired in pin, the Instigator will automatically be based on the calling context. If Spawn Actor is called from a Pawn context, the Pawn will be the Instigator. If Spawn Actor is called from an actor context, the actor's Instigator will be the Instigator.
* New: PawnActions have been introduced in the AIModule. Early access level currently.
* New: The Curve Table editor now displays data in a grid widget.
* New: Touch events (but not touch over events) are now enabled by default on Player Controllers.
* New: VisLog file name can be now customized by game-specific code.
* New: VisualLog is now acquired as a reference rather than a pointer.
* A level's transform is no longer retained when loading a sublevel after having it's persistent level loaded.
* Custom splash screen now displays correctly.
* Deprecated AActor::GetControlledPawn() to avoid confusion with AActor::GetPawn()
* Disallowed moving actors to another level if any actor is referenced by an open Matinee.
* Diffed assets no longer appear in the asset picker.
* DestroyApplication virtual function is properly called for the F<Platform>Application.
* Documented all class metadata tags.
* Ensured package metadata is loaded when trying to use it.
* Ensured that rendering resources have been released when a level is deleted.
* FSlateApplication::SetJoystickCaptorToGameViewport now captures all joysticks.
* Hid FNavigationPath's properties from public access.
* ICU initialization provides better diagnostics on failures.
* Improvements and fixes to LogVisualizer tool: log item double-click reaction to show location in a world, filters for log items and 2D graphs, performance optimizations.
* Improved display (or not) of edit boxes next to pins on Blueprint nodes.
* Improved support for OneSky localization services by adding source file information as an extracted comment and a reference comment.
* Improved localization gathering so that it doesn't gather culture invariant text.
* Improved localization gathering so that culture invariant text doesn't flag its containing archive or package as requiring localization.
* Improved localization gathering so that warnings and errors aren't reported for text that isn't gathered.
* Improved whitespace check when flagging packages/archives for localization gathering based on text contents.
* Improved navmesh projection precision.
* Made UNavigationComponent's path recalculation is being done by the path itself now.
* Pawns without a PawnMovementComponent can still use AddMovementInput() and read the results.
	* Moved ControlInputVector from PawnMovementComponent to Pawn. There are "internal" methods on Pawn for use by the component to access/modify it.
	* Added movement input accessors to Pawn: GetMovementInputVector(), ConsumeMovementInputVector(), IsMoveInputIgnored().
	* Exposed PawnMovementComponent::IsMoveInputIgnored() to Blueprints.
* Removed inappropriate menu options for Shooter Game sample when running PIE. 
* Removed path variation feature (unused and broken).
* Revised text chat in Shooter Game sample. Improved visibility flags and stopped focus being changed on clients.
* Revised the 2D side-scroller C++ template and reduced its Blueprint dependency. 
* Revised Platformer game menus to use new GameMenuBuilder.
* Several revisions to Vehicle sample game to improve multiplayer support.
* Widened tooltips (primarily) so that class comments do not get odd wrapping behaviors.
* Fixed EQS (Environmental Query System) incorrectly timeslicing.  
* The update was subtracting the time remaining for all prior steps after each step rather than subtracting the time remaining based on the time it took to execute the current step.
* Fixed crash in Shooter Game sample.
* Fixed crash in GetMousePosition() if Player is null.
* Fixed navigation links' direction RightToLeft issue.
* Fixed navigation path's checking if it intersects with a give FBox.
* Fixed Functional Testing crashing in game mode.
* Fixed project collision settings (custom profiles/channels/object types) not being saved in the DefaultEngine ini.
* Fixed a crash that could occur when starting PIE with an open, uncompiled Blueprint.
* Fixed attachment issues with Blueprint components during RerunConstructionScript
* Potentially fixed a crash that reportedly occurred while loading a few unique Blueprint assets that were missing a root component.
* Various fixes to SplitPin feature.

**CharacterMovementComponent**
* Characters that are falling and impact geometry with an unwalkable normal can check for a valid landing spot and land if possible.
	* Running and jumping up on ledges is more fluid. Previously the character would "float" for a bit before landing, which would lose velocity.
	* Added virtual ShouldCheckForValidLandingSpot() for custom behavior. Base version returns true when hitting the edge of geometry with the lower portion of the capsule.
* Bug fixes for Character movement on rotating surfaces, especially for networking.
	* Changed some MovementBaseUtility functions to conform to engine conventions ("location" rather than "position").
	* Changed AActor::PostNetReceiveLocation() to also include rotation (now called PostNetReceiveLocationAndRotation).
	* Fixed incorrect rotation delta computed in UpdateBasedMovement().
	* Fixed replicated rotation overwriting relative rotation for Characters.
	* Fixed simulated proxies not matching the server location when the velocity reached zero. Proxies would move forward one more frame in that case.
	* Fixed bIgnoreBaseRotation being ignored for simulated clients. Absolute rotation is sent in this case instead.
* Fix issues with ApplyVelocityBraking incorrectly accumulating changes when timestep is over the threshold (issue when framerate is low)
* Prevent boosting up slopes when lower portion of capsule impacts something while falling.
	* Player collision now feels more natural and less like a capsule.
	* Added HandleSlopeBoosting() to enable easier customization of this behavior.


**New: Game Instance objects (persistent gameplay data)**
* New: The Game Instance is a transient object that has a lifetime that exists across level transitions. 
* It is game extendable (set in the Maps & Modes section of the Project Settings) as both a C++ and Blueprint class.  
* It can be used to store cross-level data, manage the game's application state, and act as an owner for objects that you would like to exist across the entire game session's lifetime.  
* The GameInstance exists on both the client and the server, however, because it is a UObject there is currently no replication of data between the instances.

#### Paper 2D 
* New: Added support for dicing sprite render geometry, separating out translucent/masked quads from opaque ones (WIP).
	* Sprites now have an alternate material and the ability to have a second render section defined using that material (only used for diced geometry right now, with a convention that the alternate material is the opaque one in that case).
	* Adds a new ESpritePolygonMode::Diced value, valid only for render geometry (treated like SourceBoundingBox for collision).
	* Adds opportunistic triangle merging for both collision and render geometry when there are multiple source polygons.
* New: Added support for casting 3D shadows from sprites (FPaperRenderSceneProxy now obeys CastShadow from the source component).
* New: Added support for drag-drop reordering of keyframes in flipbooks.
* New: Added OnFinishedPlaying delegate to UPaperFlipbookComponent, called whenever a non-looping flipbook finishes playing (reaches the end or beginning, depending on play direction).
* New: Added snap to pixel grid option for pivots (enabled by default on new content), and enforced snap to pixel grid for the source rectangle (always).
* New: Added a Paper 2D demonstration level to Content Examples.
* New: Added support for replicating state of flipbook components.
* New: Added support for importing tile maps and tile sets exported from Tiled 0.90 as JSON.

* New: Significant improvements to tile map support (still experimental, must be enabled in Paper 2D project settings).
	* Added limited support for different projection modes on tile maps (orthogonal, isometric, and staggered isometric; only orthogonal works with in-editor editing).
	* Added adjustable Spacing and Margin values on tile sets (Spacing is a gap per tile in the texture, and Margin is a gap around the border).
	* Added adjustable Z offset per tile in X and Y, as well as per-layer, which permits a fix for z-fighting when using overlapping isometric tiles.
	* Added ability to drag-drop a tile set to make a new tile map actor (just sets the tile width and tile height to good defaults, nothing else).
	* Added a placeholder standalone tile map editor (doesn't edit much yet).
	* Added a component asset broker allowing tile maps components to be used in Blueprints.
	* Added display text for tile map render bounds to tile map editor.
	* Added support for dragging tile map assets into the editor viewport to create tile map actors.
	* Edits to tile sets and tile maps now refresh placed tile map instances.
	* Finished deprecating layer-wide tileset pointer and removed several bogus uses.
	* Made tile set viewer/editor draw translucent/masked textures as translucent.
	* Moved part of the geometry generation to a one-time step on the game thread instead of per-frame (WIP).

* Removed Paper 2D texture usage and dependency on Editor Style.
* Removed display of collision geometry debug text if there is no collision on the sprite.
* Renamed texture context menu command 'Configure For Sprites' to 'Configure For Retro Sprites' to better reflect the function it performs.
* Fixed a bug where bSimulatePhysics could not be set on a UPaperSpriteComponent in the Blueprint editor.
* Fixed unreliable behavior when double-clicking in Source view when PixelsPerUnrealUnit is not 1.0
* Fixed potential assertion when cooking Paper 2D content (Add ConditionalPostLoad call for associated textures to avoid load-time ordering issues when opening older sprites).
* Fixed external content reference warnings on placed assets that use the default plugin materials.
* Fixed broken tangent calculations in FPaperRenderSceneProxy that caused bogus lighting on lit sprites.

A platform that is supported but does not yet have the appropriate SDK installed will launch a tutorial for the SDK installation when a menu command is clicked.
* Bug fix for missing OpenGL extensions and entry points for OpenGL 3.x on windows.
* Fixed issue with IPP where if the mobile provision was updated it would properly copy it into the provision library.

	* Level editor widgets that lived in the menubar have moved to the window's titlebar.
* New: The editor will now save the project plist (found in the Project Settings for iOS) to Game/Build/Info.plist. This is different from previous versions where it saved it to Game/Build/Game-Info.plist. For the time being, the editor and tools will continue to look for Game-Info.plist, but this will be deprecated in the future.
* New: Updated Mac to p4api-2014.1 so that we may support SSL connections.
* New: Updated Mac OS X version check to warn users if their version is older than 10.9.4 plus fixed the check so it no longer detects 10.10 as older than 10.9.1
* Changed trackpad detection on Mac to report trackpad only if at least two fingers are touching it. This should limit issues with people accidentally touching trackpad while using mouse + WASD
* Do not disable use of glMapBuffer when using MTGL as there is an OpenGL bug that results in rendering errors in that case.
* Exposed the amount of VRAM in the GPU to the OpenGLRHI on OS X.
* Improved the code for enumerating installed engine versions in UE4EditorServices so that it doesn't include incomplete or deleted installs.
* Improved RMB handling in SNodePanel for Magic Mouse and trackpad.
* Improvements to Mac IME support:

	* Properly clear the marked and composed ranges when IME ends so that further typing or clicking works as expected.
	* Make sure that the caret position updates correctly when editing a composed range.
* On OS X Use uuid_generate rather than implementing our own GUID generation.
* Optimized UBT on Mac. The time it takes to determine if the target is out of date is much shorter now.
* Only flush after glTexStorage calls when necessary to avoid inhibiting performance on Macs with unaffected GPUs.
* Removed the GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER workaround for OS X the OpenGL driver fix is in 10.9.4.
	* All Macs will use the GL_TEXTURE_BUFFER path now as everything but a 2013 Mac Pro running 10.9.3 will work correctly.
* Stopped using Cocoa's child window mechanism since it isn't what we want.
	* Tear-out or panel-style windows are raised to float above normal windows.
	* All windows appear in Expose/Spaces/Mission Control & the are part of system window cycling.
	* Modal windows are treated slightly specially to ensure that the last shown modal window currently still open remains on top and attempts to change focus fail with visual indication.
* Fixed a problem with the editor creating /Volumes/UE4DDC folder if the shared DDC folder is not mounted on Mac.
* Fixed issues with zooming blueprint and material editor viewports with Magic Mouse.

* Made FGameplayDebuggerExec::Exec clear the replicator (and so fail to create/enable the tool) if the only Player Controllers it finds are NOT the first local Player Controller.  (That should never happen, but previously wasn't protected against properly.)
* Unreal Engine Launcher no longer loads while debugging in Visual Studio or Xcode.
	* Added new "-ForceLauncher" command-line argument that can override this.
* Updated texture streaming code to treat all UMeshComponent derived classes equally, generalizing the special treatment for USkeletalMeshComponent or UStaticMeshComponent.

* Fixed When no target platform is explicitly specified in the command line, BuildCookRun automation command will pick the currently running platform instead of always Win64. This fixes Mac problems when using BuildCookRun.
* Fixed Unknown script packages in the import list of another streaming package will now be gracefully handled instead of crashing.

**GameplayDebugger module changes:**
* Added functionality (accessible through the module interface) for creating the debugging actor given a particular player controller.
* Changed GameplayDebugger NOT to automatically create the debugging actor when a player controller is added.
* The message it was using only happens in-editor, so it didn't work in-game.  Also, in-game, we don't necessarily want every player controller creating a debug actor. So, it's now up to each user to determine which controllers should create their own debuggers.
* One correct way to create the debugger for a player controller is to have that player controller implement PostInitializeComponents(), where (after calling to the Super implementation), it can call code like this:

![](GameplayDebuggerCode1.png)

**Faster C++ Compile Times**
* 268 headers in Engine module had superfluous include statements, fixed 205 of them according to include-what-you-use principle.
* Removed 17 unnecessary include statements from Engine module private precompiled header.
* 1As a result of an on-going effort to improve compile times, some of the includes have been **removed** from public headers. The list of removed files is below. You may need to add these headers into your project source code in case it does not compile.
	* RenderUtils.h
	* Debug/DebugDrawService.h
	* KeyState.h
	* SceneManagement.h
	* ShaderParameters.h
	* ShaderCore.h
	* ShaderCompiler.h
	* ShaderParameters.h
	* MaterialShared.h
	* PrimitiveUniformShaderParameters.h

**Unreal Build Tool Improvements**
* New: Changed UBT to compile a flag for running in the DebugGame configuration into monolithic games (no need to specify -debug any more).
* New: Added better verbose debug output to detect problems with shared PCH headers.
* New: Faster startup time (reduced time spent scanning includes for UObjects).
* New: UBT now adds /FS flag in VCToolChain for VS2013 to ensure parallel builds that use PDB work properly.
* New: UBT is now detecting redistribution dependency violations. Modules can be marked as redistributable or not -- depends mostly on location, Editor and Development folder modules are non-redistributable, but it can be overridden if needed. In non-Debug and non-Editor builds UBT is checking if game being built is depending on some non-redistributable module. Programs are also not verified.
* UBT will no longer use ini files to get the list of plugins to compile for programs. Program target rules file should specify the plugins to compile for it. 
* UnrealBuildTool performance: Disabled verbose output in Release builds.
	* TRACE is no longer defined by default in Release builds.
	* If you want bPrintDebugInfo to work, use a Debug build or define TRACE to 1.
* Fixed modules that supply shared PCHs not generating and using their own unique PCH in monolithic builds.
* Fixed monolithic builds not detecting that a unique PCH was needed for modules that supply shared PCHs when header file names were different.
* Fixed UnrealBuildTool not relinking targets after plugin static libraries are modified. Dependencies were ignored because their producing action was marked as creating an import library.


#### UnrealHeaderTool
* Removed 'ScriptPlugins' ini setting. Plugins will be discovered by their 'Category' specified in uplugin file (for UHT it should be prefixed with 'UnrealHeaderTool.Code Generator.')

## Known Issues
* There is a known issue with IPP where if a user tries to import a mobile provision with a concrete application id (com.yourcompany.gamename as opposed to com.yourcompany.*) then it will fail to properly find the imported mobile provision.  The workarounds for this are as follows: 

	1) Create a wild card mobile provision. This is probably the easiest workaround and then the provision will work for any of your games during development.

	2) Create an Info.plist in your Game/Build/IOS directory. You can use the template in Engine/Build/IOS/UE4Game-Info.plist or you can edit your project settings in the editor (Project Settings / IOS Settings) to generate the Info.plist. Make sure the CFBundleIdentifier key matches the mobile provision identifier, usually com.yourcompany.gamename. Once that is done, then running IPP to import the provision and certificate should work fine.
