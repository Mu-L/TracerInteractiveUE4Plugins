# 更新

欢迎来到虚幻引擎 4.10！该版本包含大量绝妙的新功能，但我们的关注点是提高引擎的稳定性，并修复悬而未决的问题。
解决了大家报告的数百个错误，对品质进行了大量改进，并且几乎每个所支持的平台都收到了更新。

虚幻引擎旨在打造不可思议的虚拟现实体验，每个版本都会变得更好。
在该版本中，Epic 的 [子弹头列车](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmaxmnPzMWE) 虚拟现实演示使用了新功能，有专为头戴式显示器设计的全新渲染优化。

该版本也对移动设备进行了升级，带有全新的可扩展性功能，并支持折射。

对程序员来说，最后但同样好的消息是：现在，你们能在 Windows 上使用 Visual Studio 2015 进行开发了。
而在 Mac 上，我们修改了 Xcode 项目，以便让你们更高效地工作。我们还更新了目标平台，增加了对最新版 SDK 的支持。

# 主要功能

## 新增：移动设备的折射效果

现支持移动平台上的折射效果。在该版本中，带折射的现有着色器会自动在移动设备上运行，无需额外步骤！

![image alt text](image_0.png)

* 已在 iPhone 5S 和更高版本，以及 Android 设备（如，Nexus 5、Galaxy Note 4 和 Galaxy S6）上启用

* 可以通过在相应设备配置文件中设置 r.RefractionQuality 渲染变量而在其它设备上启用

## 新增：优化的虚拟现实渲染

在该版本中，你的虚拟现实游戏的速度会更快，这归功于为头戴式显示器设计的全新渲染优化项。
我们采用了全新“隐藏和可见网格优化”（Hidden and Visible Mesh optimization），以减少虚拟现实渲染的 GPU 开销。

![image alt text](image_1.png)

**[Bullet Train VR Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DmaxmnPzMWE), by Epic Games**

![image alt text](image_2.png)

由于透镜失真，这两个优化项确保我们不花费 GPU 时间处理不会显示在实际设备中的像素。
隐藏区网格充当 prepass，我们采用代表隐藏区的网格，摈弃网格背后的一切。
接着，在后处理阶段，我们使用该网格的反转（代表可见像素），然后只对其进行后处理。
通过使用这两种技术，你将获得“自由”的性能！对于“子弹头列车”，在 PC 上节省了约 0.25 毫秒，总帧周期仅为 11 毫秒。
在游戏机平台上，你有望看到更大的性能提升！

## 新增：支持 VISUAL STUDIO 2015

已对 Windows 平台上的 **Visual Studio 2015** 进行了虚幻引擎更新！

![image alt text](image_3.png)

Visual Studio 2015 包括诸如统一初始值设定项和委托构造函数的 [C++ 语言功能](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh567368.aspx) 等 [诸多新功能](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/60k1461a.aspx)。
新的编译器也与标准非常兼容，会探测出代码中的更多错误。

你可以在 [Visual Studio 网站](http://www.visualstudio.com) 下载免费的 [Visual Studio 2015社区版](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=532606)。
虚幻引擎支持 Visual Studio 2015 社区版、专业版、企业版，以及台式机的快捷版（有一些限制）。

**重要提示：** 引擎的启动程序分配现在需要 Visual Studio 2015 启用 C++ 支持。请立即升级你的团队！
如果你使用虚幻引擎内的新项目向导，我们会帮你下载并安装 Visual Studio 2015。

**重要提示：** 手动安装时，Visual Studio 2015 安装程序不默认安装 C++。
在提示时请务必选择“自定义”（Custom），然后展开编程语言部分，接着勾选 Visual C++。

首次编译项目时，请留意报告的新编译器错误，因为新的 C++ 编译器更为严格。微软已发布包含更改示例的 [文档](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb531344.aspx)，这些更改可能会影响你的代码。

如果需要继续使用 Visual Studio 2013，你需要通过 GitHub 源代码自行编译引擎。
在启动程序分配中不支持 Visual Studio 2013 的主要原因是，
两个编译器版本的附加预编译二进制文件、调试符号和静态库将大幅增大引擎的尺寸，并造成 Windows 下的项目设置更加复杂。
我们将在即将发布的版本中完全取消对 Visual Studio 2013 的支持。

## 更新：移动设备材料品质

新的材料品质系统能让你的游戏轻松支持低端设备，而不牺牲在更现代设备上的品质！

你现在能为所有材料生成低、中和高品质版的着色器！在每一等级，你能有选择地禁用渲染功能，以提升在低端设备上的性能。
UE4 将自动为众多流行设备检测良好的默认品质级别。

![image alt text](image_4.png)(convert:false)

**Galaxy S6 Edge (高品质材质)**

![image alt text](image_5.png)(w:640)

* 已自动选择高品质材料

* 镜面反射、粗糙度、金属、法线贴图和定向照明

**Galaxy S III (降低了材质品质)**

![image alt text](image_6.png)(w:640)

* 自动调整材料品质，以获得最佳性能

* 已禁用镜面反射、粗糙度变化、金属、法线贴图和定向照明

## 更新：UE4 平台更新和 SDK

UE4 的每个版本都包含对所支持平台的改进，以及对最新 SDK 平台的更新支持

![image alt text](image_7.png)

该版本中强调的平台:

* 更新了 Oculus Rift，以支持 0.8 SDK Beta
* 更新了 Oculus Mobile SDK，以支持 0.6.2
* 将 Xbox One 更新至八月的 XDK，并且现在用 Visual Studio 2015 编译
* 将 Playstation 4 更新至 SDK 3.00（支持 Playstation VR！）
* 将 iOS 支持更新至 SDK 9.0
* 将 Mac OS X更新至SDK 10.11 (El Capitan)
* 将 Xcode 支持更新至第 7 版
* Android 现支持 Marshmallow (6.0)
* 针对 Linux/SteamOS 进行持续修复，以及对较低级别的功能进行少量改进。

## 更新：地形镜像工具

使用全新镜像工具，您能轻易创建对称的景观。这对竞争的双队景观级别来说非常实用！

![](image_8.gif)(convert:false)

* 创建高度图、材质层和草地地形的镜像

* 在 X 或 Y 轴的任一方向创建镜像

## 更新：低延时虚拟现实运动控制器

我们更新了运动控制器组件，目前在开始渲染前进行后期更新。你能在下方看到后期更新和非后期更新组件在位置和旋转方面的差异。该屏幕截图是在正常速度的侧臂运动期间截取的。

![image alt text](image_9.png)(convert:false)

这是我们用来减少头戴式显示器延时的技术。我们现在每帧更新两次运动控制器组件的位置：一次在输入期间，另一次在渲染前。这意味着，控件的反映会更迅速，并能更好地反映玩家在现实世界中的运动。默认启用该功能。

## 更新：自动蓝图节点排列

我们增加了一套全面的布局套路，以便快速地自动安排蓝图。

![](image_10.gif)(convert:false)

只需右键点击所选节点，然后选择“对齐”，即可自动排列节点。

你可以用该功能：

* 根据所选节点的界限对齐它们（上/中/下、左/中/右）.

* 沿水平/垂直轴分布所选节点.

* 整理所选节点间的连接.

* 整理连接到特定引脚的特定链接.

## 更新：ANDROID 上的网络浏览器用户界面

Android 现在支持在 Widget Blueprint 中，或在 C++ 中用 Slate 代码创建的网络浏览器小组件。这可以用来显示托管在网上任何地方的内容，例如发给用户的新闻信息或帮助文本。

![image alt text](image_11.png)(convert:false)

* 在 Android 上会使用平台的本地网络控件，以便不增加可执行文件的尺寸.

* 在未来的版本中将在 iOS 上支持网络浏览器小组件.

## 更新：针对 ANDROID 的游戏手柄功能

目前在 Android 下支持多个游戏手柄，并能识别一些常见的控制器类型和映射。

会自动检测以下 Andr​​oid 控制器。其它的会归为通用映射。

## AMAZON 射击游戏控制器和 AMAZON 射击电视遥控器

![image alt text](image_12.png)(convert:false)

## NVIDIA SHIELD CONTROLLER AND SHIELD PORTABLE

![image alt text](image_13.png)(convert:false)

## SAMSUNG GAME PAD EI-GP20

![image alt text](image_14.png)(convert:false)

Android 控制器的其它新功能:

* 现在能根据控制器设备的名称自动检测映射
* 现在能同时支持多个控制器
* 现在能用右操纵杆同时控制轴的 Z/RZ 和 RX/RY 映射
* 现在左触发/制动和右触发/气轴能正常工作
* X/Y Hat 现在能映射到方向键按钮事件

对同时支持多个控制器的简要说明：现在，按下未分配游戏手柄上的按钮会将该设备 ID 与首个未分配控制器 ID 相关联。也可以用三个新蓝图节点查询或清除游戏手柄至控制器 ID 分配：

![image alt text](image_15.png)

## 更新：全面修订 XCODE 项目

我们大幅改进了为游戏生成 Xcode 项目的方式！现在，你将能使用 Xcode 的当前问题和“修复”（Fix It）功能，索引的速度也快多了。
在构建配置间切换也容易多了！

之前是一个项目包含多个目标，现在有一个包含多个项目的工作区，每个项目有一个目标。
现在，在 Xcode 中打开 UE4.xcworkspace，而不是 UE4.xcodeproj。
工作​​区中的每个项目都创建一个方案，用于构建各种 UE4 目标。创建和运行什么由现行配置和平台决定。

**在 Xcode 中选择 UE4 目标：**

![image alt text](image_16.png)(convert:false)

[REGION:caption]左侧是新的 TARGET 选择，右侧是旧的[/REGION]

**UE4 Build Configurations in Xcode:**

![image alt text](image_17.png)(convert:false)

不用再担心运行哪个可执行文件。当你切换构建配置时，Xcode 会自动选择正确的应用程序。*请注意，更改现行配置并不会更新方案编辑器中的可执行文件下拉菜单，这是 Xcode 的已知问题*。但是，当你从 Xcode 运行时，它会使用正确的应用程序。

![image alt text](image_18.png)(convert:false)

*尽管显示 StrategyGame.app，将启动StrategyGameEditor.app！*

项目索引现在应该会更快、更准确。此外，现在会显示当前问题，而且 Xcode 的修复系统能够运行：

![image alt text](image_19.png)(convert:false)

## 更新：移动设备配置文件选择器

用户现在能在 iOS 项目设置中明确地选择移动设备装置和证书。此前会使用“最匹配”装置和证书（以绿色高亮显示，如下图所示）。现在，它们旁边有复选框，从而能使用特定装置和证书，而不是最匹配的。如果未选择项目，则使用绿色的。

![image alt text](image_20.png)(convert:false)

    * As a side note, object properties are also not exposed for the same reason.

* The Blueprint details view for non-member variables (either from a parent class or an external member reference), will no longer show uneditable options as editable.

* The Get Class Defaults node now exposes Class and Interface variables.

* Graph node comment bubbles have been improved so that they don’t obscure input pins on array graph node types.

## Core

* New: Cooked packages can now be loaded in the editor if cooked for the same non-editor version of the platform the editor runs on.

* New: Optimized custom version system so that it takes less space in saved packages and is faster to access at runtime.

* Bugfix: Crash fix on deleting an Animation Blueprint and replacing it with another one.

* Bugfix: Fixed high memory usage by streaming packages in cooked builds.

* Bugfix: When using command line executable, only the call stack was visible after a crash. Now, the whole error history should be dumped to the console.

* Bugfix: Crash report client should be packaged correctly now for all projects.

## Editor and Tools

* New: Added a new experimental editor preference to enable "Sequencer"!

    * Sequencer is our upcoming level actor animation and cinematics creation tool.

    * The current version is limited in features and lacks documentation.  It’s enabled for pre-alpha testing.

    * Sequencer is still in heavy development and you can expect to see major improvements with every release.

    * If you are brave enough to try it out, please be sure to send feedback on the forums or AnswerHub!

* New: "Reset to default" button on the Image Size property of a brush now resets to the size of the brush's texture, if one is set.

* New: Actor Merging tool now supports merging of collision primitives.

* New: Added a feature allowing Detail Panel categories to be shown or hidden dynamically.

* New: Added a Launch Configuration setting to the Play on Device editor settings tab, allowing you to specify the build configuration you want to use when launching from the editor Launch button drop-down menu.

    * This also fixes an inconsistency where source code projects would build and launch the same configuration the editor is running, but Blueprint projects always launched using a Development configuration.

    * The default setting is now to launch with the same configuration as the editor, but any build configuration can be specified.

* New: Added a new editor view mode to colorize objects based on their LOD.

    * Enable from the view mode menu, or using the "viewmode lodcoloration" console command.

    * The colors to use for each LOD are configured in BaseEngine.ini under LOD Coloration Colors.

* New: Added ability to merge physics data (collision primitives) for Actor Merging tool.

* New: Added support to UnrealBuildTool to rebuild the makefile whenever the user changes a BuildConfiguration.xml file.

* New: Added template to the Plugin Creator that shows how to add an example Third Party library.

* New: Changed how actor spawning / duplication works in Simulate in Editor.

    * Now actors are always spawned non-permanently into the SIE world, and are destroyed upon exiting SIE.

    * This is more in line with other property changes to actors, which are restored to their original state when exiting SIE.

* New: 'Device Output Log' window, currently implemented only for Android devices. Hidden under editor experimental settings.

* New: Editor Analytics now tracks abnormal termination and crash events in order to improve stability.

* New: Editor Analytics shutdown reporting improvements.

    * Discounts abnormal termination when a debugger is attached.

    * Improved locking of shared resources when running multiple instances to avoid missed reports.

* New: Improved Engine Analytics settings for Editor users and End-Users of games.

    * Editor users can enable/disable their own analytics that sends usage data for their Editor sessions in "Editor Preferences->Privacy->Usage Data->Options".

    * Editor users can set the default game analytics enabled state for the end-users of their game in "Project Settings->Engine->End-User Settings->Privacy".

    * End-user's setting is easy to expose to your game UI and should be presented as an option to send usage data to Epic Games.

* Both settings are for sending analytics to Epic Games. Developers are free to add their own analytics.

* New: Improving SuperSearch to allow you to choose Google (default) or Bing as the search engine to use. In China, Google is blocked, so Bing will allow those users to use the builtin search.

* New: The process of duplicating Brushes in the editor has now been hugely optimized.

    * In a test level with 227 brushes, these are now duplicated in around 2 seconds instead of nearly 4 minutes as before.

    * A dialog has been added to show progress on the operation if it takes more than a few seconds.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to project thumbnails using corrupted PNG images. Error handling is now fixed in PNG Image Wrapper to prevent this from crashing the editor.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to editor startup. Previous, it was crashing while loading tutorial images.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when putting Recast NavMesh into a World Outliner folder.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when setting a struct variable to Curve Table Row Handle.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when expanding the viewport toolbar while in 2x2 view.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when freelooking in editor viewports due to view rotation matrix calculation bug.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when importing invalid FBX files.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to renaming asset files outside of the editor while the editor is open.

* Bugfix: Brush extrusion now works correctly when a Brush actor is rotated.

* Bugfix: Duplicating an array of instanced objects in a Property Tree will correctly deep copy the objects instead of a shallow (referenced) copy.

* Bugfix: Clicking a Text property field corresponding to multiple properties will no longer cause the "Multiple Values" text to be committed to those properties.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where widget deltas were not being correctly calculated when the widget was positioned behind the camera. This had meant that Ctrl+Mouse Button dragging to move the currently selected actor(s) along one of their axes was not working if the widget was behind the camera.

* Bugfix: Fixed Search Box widgets in context menus (for example, the search box in the Blueprint Editor context menu) so that clicking the clear button doesn't also close the parent menu.

* Bugfix: Win DualShock plugin now links in Debug Editor mode.

* Bugfix: Merge Actors tool correctly replaces the source actors with a merged one.

* Bugfix: Mirrored blocking volumes now correctly generate collision geometry.

## Content Browser

* New: Content browser asset discovery optimized. (Contributed by slonopotamus, Pull Request #1516.)

* Bugfix: Newly added collections don’t lose their selection state once you name them.

* Can no longer duplicate maps via the content browser.

## Landscape

* New: Added a mirroring tool to allow you to mirror Landscape geometry and layers using a plane.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash with landscape that has painted holes when using ES2 feature level preview or the Mobile Previewer.

* Bugfix: Fixed a race condition in material compilation that may have been causing a hard-to-reproduce crash during landscape painting.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where a None entry in the Landscape Grass Output node would cause landscape grass meshes to be assigned to the wrong layer.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where landscape grass with more than 5 layers only showed the last layer.

* Bugfix: Landscape "move to level" tool doesn’t get stuck when moving components, including after the user releases the mouse.

* Bugfix: Undoing deleted landscape components no longer leaves them uneditable.

* Bugfix: Landscape grass no longer leaves "Lighting needs to be rebuilt" warning after a static lighting build.

* Landscape Grass no longer wastes memory storing empty grass map data for areas of the landscape which don't have any grass instances.

* Removed the Layer Debug viewport view mode menu item when not in landscape edit mode.

    * This view mode it doesn't make sense without the layer checkboxes.

    * Enabling it outside landscape edit mode would previously cause the landscape to disappear.

## Material Editor

* Bugfix: Duplicate entries no longer appear in the results of searches in the Material Editor context menu.

## Matinee

* Bugfix: Editor no longer hangs when pressing "F" to frame an object while Matinee has a locked actor defined.

* Audio tracks will now start playing from the correct position when scrubbing in matinee.

## Persona:

* Bugfix: Crash fix related to state machines, states, and transitions when undoing and redoing deletions and creations.

## PhAT:

* New: Added Field of View slider to PhAT editor view.

## Source Control:

* Added support for the 64-bit git executable to the Git Source Control plugin on windows. (Contributed by SRombauts, Pull Request #1538.)

## World Browser:

* Bugfix: World composition no longer allows layers to be created with non-unique names.

* Bugfix: Handled a potential issue with Hot Reload while World Composition window is open.

## Foliage:

* New: Visibility for each foliage mesh type can be switched on/off per Editor viewport.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when assigning a new Static Mesh to Foliage that is painted across multiple levels.

* Bugfix: Foliage selection highlight no longer remains after an undo operation.

* Added a "Use as Occluder" checkbox to the foliage tool to allow foliage to correctly receive D-Buffer decals.

## Cooker:

* New: Stopped some editor debug content which wasn't required at run time from being cooked.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with modified content not getting deployed to the devkit when the project folder name and project name don't match.

* Bugfix: Added missing parameters like "cookall" to File -> Cook editor feature.

* Cooking warning related to Persona tutorial will no longer appear.

* Disabled some slow editor cooking stats.

* StableSort is used to sort .pak files in order to preserve previous sorting by file. (Contributed by Shaijan, Pull Request #1377.)

## Gameplay Framework

* New: Allow binding of the Section (§) key.

* New: Blueprints can now draw circles via the Debug Draw Circle node.

* Changed UTextRenderComponent to respond to the culture being changed, rather than constantly tick.

* Child Actors will no longer become disconnected from their parent when using SetClass.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when detaching child components if an On Attachment Change implementation also detaches a sibling component.

* Bugfix: Fixed a potential infinite loop case in post-transform navmesh updates that could lead to a crash.

## Content Examples

* Removed the Blur G-Buffer stand in the Post Processing content examples map, as that feature has been removed for some time.

## Localization

* Bugfix: Crash fix on Windows (Chinese version) when changing editor language.

## Networking

* New: The replay streaming system can now scrub to a new time while playback is paused. Try it out in ShooterGame!

* Bugfix: The output log no longer spams "no owning connection" warnings when a client uses the "ToggleDebugCamera" console command.

## Other

* New: Added in support for haptic feedback effects, which use curves of amplitude and frequency to define the response players feel in their motion controllers.

* New: Updated Oculus Mobile SDK (GearVR) to version 0.6.2.

* New: Updated Oculus SDK to 0.8.

* Bugfix: Fixed improper reporting of Is HMD Enabled.

## Physics

* Bugfix: Fixed precision issues with physics handles where rotation had to be fairly large to update target on PhysX.

* When entering "show collision" from the console, builder brushes are no longer rendered as they are now an internal detail and not intended to be viewed.

## Platforms

* New: Default movie player now has an optional bWaitForManualStop flag to prevent continuing until movie is explicitly stopped.

* New: Support for PNG and JPG splash screen images added on Linux, Mac, Windows. (Contributed by labidus, Pull Request #1444, and x414e54, Pull Request #1399.)

* Bugfix: Android build and iOS build and orientation setting overrides now save to .ini properly.

* Bugfix: Pinch events now trigger correctly every time.

* The correct texture LOD bias is now used when cooking.

* Added Touch Event Locations to pair with touch events since we want the actual location for that event. After a release, the finger ID may be reused for another touch far from the location of the release so the wrong location would be sent for all the events.

* Fixed editor primitives (e.g. debug wireframes) rendering flipped upside down on OpenGL ES2.

## Android

* New: Support for an optional launch screen for Android projects. 

    * A "Show launch image" checkbox in the Android Platform section of the Project Settings enables this feature.  Examples for portrait and landscape may be found in Engine/Build/Android/Java/res/drawable as PNG files.  

    * Click on the "..." link next to the image in the Launch Images section of the Android Platform section to bring up a browser to copy your own image into the project.  

    * If the launch image is enabled, either or both launch images selected for the project will be included depending on the orientation setting in the project.

* New: Added new targetSdkVersion setting for AndroidManifest.xml to allow overriding default minSdkVersion value.

* Bugfix: Fixed backslashes in path for Android plugin XML on Mac.

* New: Device Profile detection mechanism has been changed so that new Android devices can be detected and assigned a Device Profile using user-specified rules.

    * Instead of being hardcoded in C++, the matching rules are now specified in BaseDeviceProfiles.ini in the [/Script/AndroidDeviceProfileSelector.AndroidDeviceProfileMatchingRules] section.

* New: First implementation of Slate Web Browser for Android.

* New: It is now possible to package for a selected set of Android texture formats rather than just all or one.

    * Check the checkboxes for the formats you wish to cook for in the Platforms, Android project settings tab.

    * Select the Android_Multi cook variant when packaging.

* New: Multiple AdMob Ids may now be entered and Show Ad Banner now takes an index. New Get Ad ID Count BP node returns the array size.

* New: proguard-project.txt is now generated with additions from an optional ProguardAdditions.txt file in the project's Build/Android directory.

## Cooker

* The BuildPatchServices plugin now compiles correctly on non desktop platforms.

## Gameplay Framework

* New: FCachedReadPlatformFile is off by default on Windows since WindowsPlatformFile already caches the reads.

## Mac

* Improved error handling in Mac media player.

## Android

* New: A new Android plugin system is included in 4.10 and the GearVR plugin now uses it. Changes to the generated AndroidManifest.xml, proguard-project.xt, and GameActivity.java may be made during packaging along with staging files by adding an AndroidPlugin property in their build.cs to reference an XML file containing commands; see GearVR.build.cs and GearVR_APL.xml for an example. AndroidPluginLanguage.cs documents the commands available.

* Fixed Resolution cache RequestedContentScaleFactor log message.

* Fixed compile errors in GearVR plugin for non ARMv7 targets.

* Changed the way AAPT is located to check PgkRevision instead of always using first subdirectory of build-tools in Android SDK.

* Fixes for D3D12 resource binding on Tier 1 hardware.

# Upgrade Notes

## C++ API Changes

* Multiple AdMob IDs may now be entered and Show Ad Banner now takes an index. New Get Ad ID Count Blueprint node returns the array size.  ShowAdBanner() method in advertising provider now takes an int32 Ad ID Index.

* Fixed return value of the HexToBytes function.  Code which uses the return value of HexToBytes should be aware that the return value is now 1 more than before.

* UPackage::PackageFlags made private.  UPackage::PackageFlags has been deprecated and should no longer be set or read directly. Use Get/Set/Clear/HasAny/HasAll PackageFlags instead.

* "Reset to default" button on the Image Size property of a brush now resets to the size of the brush's texture, if one is set.  IDetailPropertyRow::OverrideResetToDefault() parameters have changed to take a single parameter of type FResetToDefaultOverride that defines the override behavior.

## Blueprints

* New placements of a GetClassDefaults node in a Blueprint function graph will no longer expose array properties that contain object references. This is currently needed in order to prevent mutation of a default object that belongs to an owning class.

    * Existing placements will preserve any exposed property whose default value is an array of object references, but the Blueprint compiler will now emit an "unsafe connection" warning in this case, as it's a potential risk, as we don't currently support read-only object references in a Blueprint.

## Xbox One

* The default Xbox One XDK has been updated to August 2015. A minimum XDK version of August 2015 is required to build using the Visual Studio 2015 XDK version on Xbox One.
