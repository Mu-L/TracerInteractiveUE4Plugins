언리얼 엔진 4.7 은 지금까지 있었던 것 중 가장 큰 릴리즈로, 대규모 월드에 엄청난 수의 오브젝트 인스턴스 렌더링, 아름다운 잎사귀와 초목 렌더링, HDR 텍스처 지원, 에디터내 애니메이션 편집 기능과 아울러 수백종의 최적화와 개선사항이 포함되어 있습니다.

요청이 많았던 기능도 다수 추가되었습니다: 이제 레벨에서 바로 컴포넌트를 사용하여 새로운 액터를 조립할 수도, 블루프린트 비주얼 스크립팅이나 C++ 를 사용하여 별도의 커스텀 컴포넌트 유형을 만들 수도 있게 되었습니다! 스크립팅에 대해 말할 것 같으면, 블루프린트 에디터 UI 가 깔끔하게 통일된 레이아웃으로 개편되었습니다. 프로젝트에 콘텐츠를 임포트해 오는 방법도 전에 없이 쉬워졌습니다. 이제 언리얼 에디터가 새로운 애셋 파일을 자동으로 감지하여 임포트해 줍니다!

HTML5 플랫폼 + WebGL 이 사용 준비가 완료되었습니다. 한 번의 클릭으로 게임을 호환되는 브라우저에서 실행시킬 수 있습니다! 이제 Android 개발자들도 Mac에서 빌드, 쿠킹, 디플로이 가능합니다. 가상 현실 제작자들의 경우, 새로운 "VR 프리뷰" 기능으로 에디터에서 바로 월드에 몰입이 가능합니다. 추가로 코드 기반 프로젝트를 만드는 경우 Leap Motion 에 접근할 수 있습니다. 마지막으로 모든 릴리즈마다 풀 C++ 엔진 소스 코드를 제공하여 학습과 디버깅이 전에 없이 쉬워집니다!



이번 릴리즈에는 언리얼 엔진의 놀라운 개발자 커뮤니티에서 제출된 뛰어난 변경사항 38 개가 포함되어 있습니다. 에픽에서는 언리얼 엔진 이번 릴리즈에 Git 소스 컨트롤 플러그인을 기여해 주신 커뮤니티 일원 Sebastien Rombauts 께 특별히 감사드리고자 합니다. 놀라운 작업물입니다! 아래 기여자분들께도 모두 감사드립니다:

Artem V. Navrotskiy (bozaro), ArneBezuijen, Black Phoenix (PheonixBlack), codetackler, Daniel Zeligman (dzeligman), Derek van Vliet (derekvanvliet), Fazouane Marouane (fazouane-marouane), Jesus Fernandez (jsfdez), Lukasz Baran (iniside), Moritz Wundke (moritz-wundke), Michael Kosel (TheCodez), Michael Allar (Allar), Marat Radchenko (slonopotamus), 3dluvr, Pierdek, Quadtree, Rama (EverNewJoy), Robert Wallis (robert-wallis), Rick Yorgason (Skrapion), Simon Taylor (simontaylor81), Stephen Whittle (stephenwhittle), Tobias Mollstam (mollstam), Cengiz Terzibas (yaakuro)
 
## 주요 기능

#### 현실적인 폴리지 라이팅
새로운 **Foliage Shading Model** (폴리지 셰이딩 모델)을 통해 빛이 풀, 잎, 종이, 기타 재질을 투과할 수 있게 되었습니다.

![](RealisticFoliageLighting.png)

반대 표면의 디퓨즈 라이팅은 셰이딩되는 면에서 투과(transmissive) 라이팅이 됩니다.
	
* 투과 라이팅은 감아올린(wrap-around) 디퓨즈와 후방 산란을 위해 뷰 의존적인 엽(lobe)을 혼합한 것입니다.
* 서브서피스 컬러는 이 라이팅을 필터링하여 (잎Mac 등의) 다양한 두께를 나타내는 데도 사용할 수 있습니다.
* 참고로 이 셰이딩 모델에 오파시티를 사용하면 그림자 감쇠 거리에만 영향을 끼칩니다.

#### 대규모 월드용 폴리지 렌더링
폴리지 시스템이 대규모 야외 환경을 지원하도록 최적화되었습니다!

![](FoliageRenderingLargeworlds.png)

이제 백만 단위 인스턴스의 폴리지 관리 및 컬링을 위해 계층구조식 시스템을 사용합니다! 또한 LOD 전환시 거슬리게 튀는 현상을 없애기 위해 일시적 페이드를 포함해서 메시 LOD 간의 부드러운 전환을 이끌어냅니다!

#### 월드내 컴포넌트 편집
이제 컴포넌트를 레벨에 배치된 액터에 바로 추가시킬 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 클래스 블루프린트를 먼저 만들지 않고도 컴포넌트로부터 새로운 액터를 조립할 수 있습니다. 레벨 안에서 바로 컴포넌트로 실험하면서 새로운 오브젝트를 조립해 보기에 좋습니다.

![](InworldComponentEditing01.png)

이제 3D 레벨에서 개별 컴포넌트를 선택한 다음, 익숙한 기즈모를 사용하여 옮기고, 프로퍼티를 편집할 수 있습니다.

![](InworldComponentEditing02.png)

멋진 것을 만든 이후에는 "블루프린트 / 스크립트 추가"를 클릭하여 재사용가능 클래스로 저장하거나 거기에 스크립트를 추가합니다. 그러면 그 액터를 자동으로 해당 클래스의 인스턴스로 대체합니다.

![](InworldComponentEditing03.png)

#### 배치가능 기본 액터

이제 레벨에 바로 "기본 액터" 를 드래그 앤 드롭으로 배치할 수 있습니다!

![](PlaceableEmptyActors.png)

기본 폰과 캐릭터도 지원됩니다. 새로운 월드내 컴포넌트 편집 기능을 사용하여 레벨에서 바로 재미난 액터를 만들 수 있습니다.

#### 블루프린트 가능 컴포넌트

블루프린트 스크립팅을 사용하여 자신만의 컴포넌트 유형을 만들어 보세요! 이러한 컴포넌트를 저장하여 어느 액터에도 재사용할 수 있습니다!

"컴포넌트 추가" 를 클릭한 다음, 바로 상단에 있는 "새 블루프린트 스크립트 컴포넌트..."를 선택합니다. 이 작업은 레벨에 있는 액터상에서, 액터 클래스 블루프린트 안에서, 콘텐츠 브라우저의 "새 블루프린트..." 창 안에서도 가능합니다.

![](BPComponents01.png)

새 컴포넌트의 부모 클래스를 선택합니다. "씬 컴포넌트" 에는 액터 안에 3D 위치가 있으나, "액터 컴포넌트" 에는 스크립팅 로직만 있습니다.

![](BPComponents02.png)

재밌는 부분은 여기, 새 컴포넌트에 대한 블루프린트 스크립트 코드 작성 부분입니다. 이 예제에서, Tick 이벤트를 사용하여 매 프레임마다 컴포넌트의 오너(액터)를 yaw 축 중심으로 회전시킵니다. 이 컴포넌트 이름은 액터를 스핀시키므로 "Spinner" 라 붙였습니다!

![](BPComponents03.png)

 이제, 씬의 어느 액터에도 컴포넌트를 드랍하면 게임 시작시 회전을 시작할 것입니다. 예! 재사용 가능한 모듈식 함수성 완성입니다!

![](BPComponents04.png)

 보통의 액터 클래스 블루프린트에 드롭할 수도 있습니다. 새 컴포넌트는 항상 "컴포넌트 추가" 메뉴에서 ("Custom" 카테고리 아래), 또 다른 애셋과 마찬가지로 콘텐츠 브라우저에서도 찾을 수 있습니다.

#### 자동 애셋 임포트
메시, 사운드, 텍스처 임포트가 더욱 쉬워졌습니다. 그냥 프로젝트의 Content 폴더 아래에서 소스 아트 파일을 저장하기만 하면, 에디터가 자동으로 새로운 파일을 임포트해 주므로, UE4 에서 바로 사용할 수 있습니다!

640
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:height]
360
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
8iXezqbc2kE
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]

외부 어플리케이션에서 이 파일을 업데이트하면, 에디터가 자동 감지하여 콘텐츠를 리임포트할 것입니다! 게임 콘텐츠 반복처리 작업이 훨씬 빨라집니다.

이 기능은 기본으로 켜져있으나, 에디터 개인설정의 `"로드 & 저장"` 섹션의 "Monitor Content Directories" (콘텐츠 디렉터리 모니터링) 옵션으로 토글시킬 수 있습니다.

#### 블루프린트 에디터 UI 디자인 변경
블루프린트 에디터의 디자인이 더욱 사용하기 쉽도록 변경되었습니다! 세 가지 모드 전부 하나의 화면으로 통합되어 작업의 흐름을 더욱 매끄럽게 파악할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라, 여러가지 개선사항도 포함되어 있습니다.

![](BlueprintEditorUI.png)

뷰포트나 그래프 뷰와 같은 패널을 자유롭게 재배치할 수 있으며, 심지어 둘 다 동시에 화면에 띄울 수도 있습니다!

"내 블루프린트" 뷰가 더욱 깔끔하고 넓직하게 개조되어, 새로운 함수와 변수를 추가하기가 쉬워졌습니다.

컴포넌트 패널에서 액터의 이름을 선택하면 (또는 툴바의 "클래스 디폴트"를 클릭하면) 클래스의 기본값이 표시됩니다. 블루프린트 세팅을 확인하려면, 툴바의 "클래스 세팅" 버튼을 사용하세요 (기존에는 "블루프린트 속성" 버튼이었습니다).

#### HTML5 및 WebGL 지원 (Windows 전용)
이제 런처를 통해 얻을 수 있는 바이너리 툴을 통해 게임을 웹 브라우저에서 패키징 및 실행시킬 수 있습니다.

![](HTML5_WebGL01.png)

간단히 [Emscripten SDK](http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) 를 설치한 다음, 에디터와 런처를 재시작하고, 런처 드롭다운 메뉴에서 웹 브라우저를 선택하면 됩니다!

![](HTML5_WebGL02.png)

HTML5 지원 관련 참고사항:

* 개발 도중에는 파이어폭스, 사파리, 64 비트 크롬이 필요합니다 (쉬핑 빌드는 32 비트 크롬에서도 정상 작동합니다).
* 현재 HTML5 지원을 위해서는 Windows가 필요합니다. 앞으로 Mac도 지원하도록 작업중입니다.
* 게임을 HTML5 용으로 준비할 때, 특히나 처음에는, 프로젝트의 애셋과 코드를 웹브라우저용으로 최적화시키느라 시간이 조금 걸릴 수 있습니다.

#### OpenEXR: HDR 텍스처
2D High Dynamic Range (HDR) 텍스처를 **OpenEXR 파일** 에서 임포트할 수 있게 되었습니다!  채널별로 최대 16 비트 데이터까지의 이미지를 (약 30 번의 노출) 저장할 수 있습니다.

![](HighDynamicRangeTex.png)

(기존에는, 큐브 맵 텍스처만 OpenEXR 파일에서 임포트할 수 있었습니다.)

#### Mac에서의 Android 개발
언리얼 엔진 OS X 버전이 이제 Android 개발을 완벽 지원합니다!

![](AndroidDeployMac01.png)

이제 Mac 사용자도 Android용으로 빌드, 쿠킹, 패키징 뿐만 아니라 에디터 또는 명령줄을 통해 Android 디바이스에 디플로이도 가능합니다.

![](AndroidDeployMac02.png)

OS X 용 Java 및 Android SDK 가 필요합니다 (Engine/Extras/Android 의 TADP 인스톨러를 사용하여 설치 가능합니다).
설치 이후에는 에디터를 재시작하거나, 프로젝트 세팅에서 새로 생긴 Android SDK 섹션에 SDK 경로를 설정하면 됩니다.

#### 풀 엔진 C++ 소스 코드 및 디버그 심볼
이제 런처를 사용하여 언리얼 엔진을 설치할 때도 풀 엔진 C++ 소스 코드 및 디버깅 심볼이 포함됩니다!

![](Fullc++Source.png)

이를 통해 디버깅 도중 매끄럽게 엔진 코드를 단계별로 살펴볼 수 있으며, 크래시 이후 온전한 콜스택을 얻을 수 있을 것입니다. 더이상 제대로 된 엔진 디버깅 파워를 얻기 위해 엔진을 직접 컴파일할 필요가 없습니다.

참고로 엔진을 직접 다시 컴파일하려는 경우라면, 여전히 [GitHub 로 이동](https://www.unrealengine.com/ue4-on-github) 하여 필수 파일을 전부 구해야 합니다.

#### 가상 현실 플레이
에디터에 "VR 프리뷰" 버튼을 추가했습니다! Oculus 리프트 디바이스가 연결된 상태라면, 게임을 가상 현실 모드에서 바로 플레이할 수 있습니다.

![](PlayinVR.png)

"VR 프리뷰" 를 클릭하면 에디터 창이 최소화되고, Oculus 리프트 디바이스에서 게임에 바로 뜹니다.


#### Leap Motion 플러그인 *베타*
이제 UE4 의 플러그인을 통해 **Leap Motion 디바이스** 가 지원됩니다. 이를 통해 Leap 의 손 추적 기술을 프로젝트에 바로 사용할 수 있게 되었습니다. 해당 API 는 블루프린트와 코드 양쪽에 노출되어 있어, 어떤 프로젝트에서도 해당 기술을 활용할 수 있습니다.

플러그인 사용법 관련 예제는, [](https://www.leapmotion.com) 웹사이트를 참고해 주세요.  현재 이 플러그인은 GitHub 에서 엔진을 빌드하신 분들, Leap 웹사이트에서 플러그인을 직접 다운로드하신 분들만 사용 가능합니다.

#### 콘텐츠 브라우저에서 C++ 클래스
게임의 C++ 클래스가 이제 콘텐츠 브라우저에 보입니다!

![](C++ContentBrowser.png)

손쉽게 콘텐츠 브라우저 안에서 바로 새로운 C++ 클래스를 만들 수 있습니다! 자동으로 컴파일되고 에디터에 표시되어, 바로 사용할 수 있습니다!

![](C++ContentBrowser2.png)

C++ 클래스 아이콘에 더블클릭하면 Visual Stuio 또는 Xcode 에서 해당 소스 코드에 바로 점프하거나, 우클릭하면 선택된 클래스를 기반으로 새 클래스를 만들 수도 있습니다.

#### 모프 타깃 과장
모프 타깃의 웨이트를 100% 이상으로 하여 과장된 포즈를 만들거나, 0% 미만으로 하여 반대 포즈를 만들 수 있습니다.

![](MorphTargetExagg.png)

#### 피처 팩 및 콘텐츠 팩
이제 콘텐츠 브라우저를 사용하여 새로운 "피처" 및 콘텐츠를 게임에 언제든지 추가시킬 수 있습니다! 팩에는 어떠한 콘텐츠, 블루프린트 클래스, C++ 클래스 조합도 포함 가능합니다.

![](FeaturePacksandContentBrowser.png)

모든 기존 템플릿 프로젝트 피처는 '피처 팩'으로 사용 가능합니다. 그래서 일인칭 피처 팩을 게임에 추가한 다음, 나중에 비히클 피처 팩을 추가하면 프로젝트에 두 피처 모두 사용 가능합니다!

콘텐츠 브라우저에서, '신규 추가'를 클릭한 다음 '피처 또는 콘텐츠 팩 추가...' 를 선택합니다. 파일이 프로젝트에 바로 주입됩니다. 여러 팩에 튜토리얼도 내장되어 있을 수가 있습니다!

![](FeaturePacksandContentBrowser2.png)

시작용 콘텐츠도 언제든지 프로젝트에 추가시킬 수 있습니다. 사실 "모바일 최적화된" 시작용 콘텐츠 팩도 있습니다.

#### 애니메이션 편집 시스템
이제 페르소나 애니메이션 툴 안에서 바로 애니메이션을 편집할 수 있습니다!

![](AnimEditingSystem01.png)

타임 슬라이더를 잡아끌고, 본을 선택한 다음 기즈모를 사용하여 이동 및 회전시키고, 어느 프레임에든 키를 설정합니다. (힌트: 단축키는 'S' 입니다)

![](AnimEditingSystem02.png)

페르소나 안에서 애니메이션 커브에 대한 편집 내용은 전부 "더하기식 레이어"로 저장됩니다. 원본 애니메이션을 리임포트하기로 결정한 경우, 변경 내용이 보존됩니다! 이 레이어는 페르소나에서만 존재합니다. "적용" 툴바 버튼을 클릭하기만 하면 변경 내용이 적용되어 게임에서 애니메이션을 확인할 수 있습니다!

![](AnimEditingSystem03.png)

전체 새로운 커스텀 애니메이션을 저장하는 것도 가능합니다! "애셋 생성" 툴바 버튼을 사용하여 레퍼런스 포즈에서든, 아니면 현재 포즈 또는 애니메이션에서든 애니메이션을 만들 수 있습니다.

![](AnimEditingSystem04.png)

기타 참고사항:

* 애니메이션 커브는 필요치 않은 경우 비활성화 또는 삭제 가능합니다.
* 굽고 나면 익스포트는 최종 구워진 애니메이션에 작동합니다. 애디티브 커브는 익스포트되지 않습니다.
* 리타기팅시 커브는 전송되지 않습니다. 하지만 최종 구워진 애니메이션은 리타기팅될 것입니다.

#### 즉석 본 컨트롤러 프리뷰
Bone Controller 노드는 이제 뷰포트 기즈모를 사용하여 대화식으로 조절 가능하며, 매번 컴파일할 필요가 없습니다!

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]
[PARAMLITERAL:width]
640
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:height]
360
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[PARAMLITERAL:videoid]
VthaM3yZbVM
[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]

현재 이 기능은 TwoBoneIK, ModifyBone & Fabrik 노드에서만 작동하나, 현재 추가 작업중입니다.

#### 피직스에서 애니메이션 제작
피직스 에디터(PhAT)에서 물리 시뮬레이션을 녹화하여 애니메이션으로 저장 가능합니다!

![](AnimFromPhys_Record_01.png)

툴바의 "녹화" 버튼을 클릭하여 시작한 다음, 뷰포트에서 오브젝트를 만져 재미난 시뮬레이션을 만듭니다. 다 됐으면 "중지"를 눌러 시뮬레이션을 애니메이션으로 저장합니다.

레벨에서 바로 애니메이션을 캡처할 수도 있습니다!

* 레벨 에디터에서 '플레이' 툴바 드롭다운의 "시뮬레이트" 버튼을 클릭합니다.
* 씬에서 시뮬레이션되는 스켈레탈 메시를 찾습니다.
* 메시에 우클릭한 다음 "시뮬레이션 변경사항 유지" (또는 'K' 키)를 선택하여 애니메이션을 저장합니다!

#### 프로젝트 런처
새로운 프로젝트 런처 인터페이스를 통해 더욱 많은 옵션으로 게임을 더욱 쉽게 실행 또는 패키징 가능합니다!

![](ProjectLauncher.png)

프로젝트 런처에는 여러가지 유형의 디바이스와 환경설정으로 게임 테스트를 도와주는 기능이 있을 뿐만 아니라, 다중 세션을 동시에 실행시킬 수도 있습니다. 쉽게 커스터마이징 가능한 빌드 유형과 쿠킹 설정을 통해 연결된 디바이스에서 프로젝트를 실행시켜 보세요.

**Custom Launch Profiles** (커스텀 실행 프로파일)을 통해 필요에 맞는 빌드를 만듭니다.

* 고급 옵션이 전부 노출됩니다.
* 빌드하고자 하는 콘텐츠만 딱 선택합니다.
* 한번에 복수의 플랫폼을 빌드합니다.
* 다른 사람이, 또는 나중에 실행할 수 있는 빌드를 패키징하고 저장합니다.

물론 여전히 메인 툴바에 있는 편리한 "실행" 버튼을 사용하여 게임을 실행시킬 수도 있습니다. 하지만 보다 유연한 환경을 위해서는, "실행" 툴바 드롭다운 메뉴나 메인 창 메뉴에서 프로젝트 런처를 여는 것이 좋습니다.

#### 블루프린트 병합 툴
새로운 블루프린트 병합 툴을 사용하여 여러가지 블루프린트를 병합시킬 수 있습니다.

이 툴은 두 블루프린트를 시각적으로 비교해 주어 그 둘을 합치는 데 도움이 됩니다! 각기 다른 팀원이 하나의 블루프린트를 변경한 경우, 그 내용을 병합시키고자 할 때 좋습니다.

![](BPmergeTool.png)

이 툴을 사용하는 방법은 세 가지입니다:

* 블루프린트 에디터에서 **파일 -> 병합** 을 선택합니다.
* 소스 컨트롤 병합 충돌이 있는 애셋에 우클릭한 다음 **병합** 을 선택합니다.
* **명령줄** 에서 `UE4Editor.exe -diff [옵션] <파일 A> <파일 B> <공통 조상 파일> <출력 파일>` 을 실행시킵니다.

#### Git 소스 컨트롤 플러그인 (베타!)

뛰어난 Git 소스 컨트롤 플러그인을 언리얼 엔진에 기여해 주신 커뮤니티 일원 Sebastien Rombauts 께 감사드립니다!

![](GitHubPlugin.png)

Git 저장소에 프로젝트를 연결한 경우, 파일 추가 및 제거, 변경사항 제출, 파일 히스토리 표시, 파일 버전비교, 애셋의 소스 컨트롤 상태 표시와 같은 대부분의 소스 컨트롤 작업이 에디터에 지원됩니다.

#### AI 인지 시스템: 블루프린트 스크립팅
AI 인지(Perception) 시스템은 이제 블루프린트 스크립트를 통해 환경설정 가능합니다! AI 에 AI Perception 컴포넌트를 추가한 다음, 그 프로퍼티와 이벤트를 조사하고 조절해 주면 됩니다.

![](AIperceptionSystem.png)

#### 새 프로젝트 템플릿에 대한 튜토리얼
새 프로젝트 템플릿 각각에 해당 템플릿의 애셋과 클래스 작동방식에 대한 간략 개요가 제공되는 **개요 튜토리얼** 이 포함되어 있습니다.

![](TemplateTutorial.png)

콘텐츠 브라우저에서 튜토리얼 썸네일에 **'재생' 버튼을 클릭** 하기만 하면 시작됩니다!

![](TutorialContentBrowser.jpg)

콘텐츠 팩 및 피처 팩 역시 자체적으로 튜토리얼을 포함시킬 수 있습니다! 프로젝트에 팩을 추가한 경우, 재생할 수 있는 튜토리얼이 있나 찾아보면 해당 피처 또는 콘텐츠 팩에 대해 쉽게 알아볼 수 있습니다!

#### 새로운 썸네일 모양과 느낌
에디터에 새로운 **형형색색 스타일** 을 사용하여 **애셋 썸네일** 이 표시됩니다.

![](NewThumbNail.png)

또한, C++ 클래스와 블루프린트 클래스 둘 다 가능한 경우 **라이브 3D 썸네일** 뿐만 아니라, 구석에는 부모 클래스가 무엇인지 나타내는 **작은 아이콘** 이 표시됩니다.

#### Paper2D:  개선된 타일 맵 레이어 편집
타일 맵 에디터에 유용한 **레이어 편집 기능** 을 다수 추가했습니다!

![](Paper2DimprovedTilemap.png)

* 레이어 각각을 기준으로 올리거나 낮추어 순서를 변경할 수 있습니다.
* 레이어 브라우저의 선택을 통해 이제 항상 최상위 레이어에 칠하기 보다는 어느 레이어에 칠할지 조절할 수 있습니다.
* 선택된 레이어는 서로 다른 편집 세션간에도 유지됩니다.
* 선택된 레이어는 이제 올바른 깊이에 헬퍼 그리드가 렌더링되며, 선택되지 않은 모든 레이어에 대해 와이어프레임 윤곽선이 그려집니다.
* 레이어 이름변경은 월드 아웃라이너에서의 액터 이름변경과 똑같은 방식으로 작동하며, 비주얼 스타일이 더욱 명확해지고 클릭 반응도 보다 직관적입니다.
* 이제 레이어를 복제 가능합니다.
* 타일 맵은 이제 애셋으로 승격 명령으로 레벨에 재사용가능 애셋 또는 인스턴스가 될 수 있습니다.
* 새로 추가된 레이어의 이름이 보다 유의미해 졌습니다.
* 주: 타일 맵은 이번 언리얼 엔진 버전에서도 여전히 '실험단계' 기능입니다.

#### Paper2D:  플립북 콜리전 감지
플립북을 통해 시퀀스로 재생되는 **이미지에서 2D 애니메이션 생성** 이 가능합니다. 이제 애니메이션 프레임에 대한 **콜리전 프로퍼티** 를 정의할 수 있습니다!

![](Paper2DFlipbook.png)

플립북 애셋에 플립북에 대한 콜리전 데이터(가 있다면 그) 소스를 조절하는 Collision Source 프로퍼티가 새로 생겼습니다.

* **No Collision**: 콜리전 없음 - 플립북에 콜리전이 없습니다.
* **First Frame Collision**: 첫 프레임 콜리전 - 애니메이션의 첫 프레임을 기준으로 플립북에 애니메이션이 적용되지 않는 콜리전이 있습니다.
* **Each Frame Collision**: 각 프레임 콜리전 - 애니메이션에 따라 플립북 콜리전도 매 프레임 변합니다 (주: 이 세팅은 매 프레임 물리 상태 재생성이 필요하므로 비쌀 수 있습니다).

사용법 관련 참고사항:

* 여러가지 경우 소스 프레임에서 콜리전을 직접 생성하는 것 보다는, 플립북 컴포넌트의 소켓에 (박스 컴포넌트 등의) 콜리전 컴포넌트를 붙이는 것이 나을 수 있습니다. 일부 콜리전 구역이 다른 블록과 겹치도록 하려는 경우에는 특히나 그렇습니다.
* 캐릭터 이동은 여전히 콜리전 캡슐에 의존하므로, 플립북에는 대부분의 경우 BlockAll 이외의 콜리전 채널을 사용해야 캡슐이 플립북에 달라붙어 꼼짝 못하게 되는 경우를 방지할 수 있습니다 (이동은 캡슐에 따라 블록시키고, 발사체 관련 겹침이나 충돌 검사는 플립북을 기준으로 합니다).

#### UI: 커스텀 커서 지원
이제 **커스텀 위젯** 을 만들어 프로젝트에 **소프트웨어 커서** 로 사용할 수 있습니다. UMG 의 모든 기능을 사용하여 텍스트, 생명력 바, 툴팁 등 원하는 대로 커서에 추가시킬 수 있습니다.

![](UIcustomCursor.png)

소프트웨어 커서는 여러가지 경우에 유용하게 쓰일 수 있습니다:

* 하드웨어 커서가 없는 플랫폼에 커서를 추가합니다. 콘솔에서 가상 마우스 커서를 예로 들 수 있습니다.
* 시각적으로 풍부하고 애니메이션이 있거나 복합적인 상호작용의 커서를 추가합니다.
* 각 플랫폼의 포맷 제한을 걱정할 필요 없이 PC, Mac, Linux에 일관된 모양의 커서를 추가합니다.

**프로젝트 세팅** 의 새로운 **유저 인터페이스** 섹션을 사용하여 게임의 소프트웨어 커서 위젯을 구성할 수 있습니다. 커서를 지정하지 않는다면, **기본** 하드웨어 커서가 나옵니다.

[REGION:note]
주: 소프트웨어 커서 모션은 운영체제에 의해 렌더링되는 일반 마우스 커서와는 달리 게임의 프레임 속도의 제한을 받습니다. 선택시 가장 크게 고려해야할 부분입니다.
[/REGION]

#### 언리얼 모션 그래픽: 새로운 위젯 바인딩 시스템
위젯에 대한 바인딩 시스템이 대규모 개조 공사를 거쳐 위젯의 하위 프로퍼티 및 함수에 대한 바인딩이 가능해짐은 물론 퍼포먼스도 크게 향상되었습니다!

![](UMGnewWidget.png)

새로운 위젯 바인딩 관련 참고사항

* 바인딩은 블루프린트 스크립트 사용을 통해서가 아닌, 필드 세트에 대한 동적인 계산을 통해 이루어집니다.
* C++ 과 블루프린트 함수 양쪽에 대한 직접 바인딩이 지원됩니다!
* 사소한 변환은 자동으로 처리됩니다 (예: Linear Color 에서 Slate Color 로, Texture2D 에서 Slate Brush 로).
* 이러한 변화로 인해 프로퍼티에 대한 바인딩이 훨씬 빨라졌습니다 (약 10 배)!
* 이전 바인딩도 여전히 작동은 하지만, 퍼포먼스 향상 적용을 위해서는 새로운 시스템으로 업데이트해야 합니다.

#### 비주얼 로거 (AI 시각화 툴)
* 비주얼 로거 툴이 여러가지 기능으로 완전히 새로워졌습니다. 프로젝트의 **AI** 디버깅 및 미세조정을 돕기 위해 디자인되었습니다!

![](VisualLoggerAI.png)

* 이벤트를 기록한 다음, 강력한 툴을 사용하여 타임라인 검색을 합니다. 예제는 이 [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jiUyciKvUI&feature=youtu.be) 에서 확인할 수 있습니다.
* 타임라인 항목 중 경고가 있으면 노랑으로, 오류가 있으면 빨강으로 표시됩니다.
* 게임 일시정지 도중 특수한 디버그 카메라를 사용하여 날아다닐 수 있습니다.
* 비주얼 로거 이벤트에서 생성된 '리포트'를 저장합니다. 리포트의 하이퍼링크를 통해 로그에 필터를 적용하여 더욱 쉬운 분석이 가능합니다.

#### 반투명 오브젝트 순서 제어
반투명 오브젝트의 렌더링 순서를 설정할 수 있도록 해주는 신기능입니다. 2D 게임에 정말 좋습니다!

![](TranslucentObject.png)

프로젝트의 렌더링 세팅에서 새로운 **Translucent Sort Policy** (반투명 소팅 정책) 옵션을 확인합니다.

* **Sort by Distance**: 거리별 소팅 - 카메라에서 오브젝트의 바운딩 구체 중심까지 거리에 따라 소팅합니다. 기본 옵션으로, 3D 게임에 최적입니다.
* **Sort by Projected Z**:  투사된 Z 별 소팅 - 카메라에 사후-투사 Z 거리에 따른 소팅입니다. 카메라 회전에 따라 튀어보일 수 있습니다.
* **Sort Along Axis**:  축에 따른 소팅 - 고정된 축상의 투사에 따른 소팅입니다. 보통 2D 게임에 최적인 옵션입니다.  소팅 기준이 되는 축을 Translucent Sort Axis (반투명 소팅 축)이라고 하며, 렌더러 프로젝트 세팅을 통해 수정할 수도 있습니다 (기본값은 -Y 입니다).

#### 블루프린트 순환 종속성 해결
블루프린트가 순환(cyclic)하는 상황을 처리할 수 있도록 로딩 방식 디자인을 고쳤습니다. 블루프린트는 원하는 모든 방식으로 혼합하거나 상호 통신 가능하며, 가중 중요한 점은, 다음 번에도 제대로 로드될 것입니다.

이를 통해 여러가지 블루프린트 로드시 발생하는 크래시 및 기형적인 상태로 로드되는 상황이 해결될 것입니다!

#### 언리얼 C++ 프로그래밍 개선사항
언리얼 엔진에서 모두가 C++ 를 보다 쉽고 친숙하게 사용할 수 있도록 지속적인 작업을 하고 있습니다.

* 별도의 생성자가 필요치 않습니다! 클래스 생성자는 더이상 Object Initializer 인수를 받을 필요가 없습니다.
* 언리얼 클래스에 대한 서브 오브젝트 생성을 위한 간단한 문법이 새로 생겼습니다.



#### 멀티 스레드 애니메이션
애니메이션 포즈 계산이 멀티 코어 CPU 에 분산되어 엔진이 애니메이션을 계산하느라 걸리는 총 시간이 줄었습니다.

애니메이션 스켈레탈 메시가 많은 게임의 퍼포먼스가 향상됩니다!

#### Android에서 데스크톱 퀄리티 렌더링 *베타* (OpenGL ES 3.1 w/ AEP)
(Android Extension Pack 이 결합된) OpenGL ES 3.1 를 통해 Android 디바이스에서도 **데스크톱 수준의 렌더링** 느낌을 내는 기능을 대부분 사용할 수 있습니다! 이 기능은 현재 **베타** 테스팅 단계이니, 피드백을 주시면 고맙겠습니다.

* 이제 빌드와 쿠킹 타깃에 **ES3.1+AEP** 를 선택할 수 있습니다.
* Tegra K1 디바이스 (예: NVIDIA Shield Tablet) 가 테스팅 및 개발에 사용되었습니다. 앞으로 AEP 를 지원하는 디바이스가 많아질 것입니다!
* Android 프로젝트 세팅에서 "Enable OpenGL ES31 + AEP" 옵션을 통해 활성화시킵니다.

[REGION:note]
현재 이 기능을 사용하기 위해서는 GitHub 의 소스를 통해 엔진을 직접 컴파일해야 합니다.

블루프린트 전용 프로젝트는 엔진의 BaseEngine.ini 파일 내 **bBuildForES31** 옵션을 켜서 OpenGL ES 3.1 기능이 지원되는 베이스 UE4Game 실행파일을 리컴파일해야 합니다.
[/REGION]

#### 다운로드가능 콘텐츠 (DLC) 패키징 *베타*
이제 **다운로드가능 콘텐츠** (DLC) 를 배포용으로 패키징 가능합니다!

현재 이 기능은 **베타 테스팅** 단계이며, 명령줄 툴이 필요합니다. 게임 플러그인 Content 폴더 안에서 애드온 DLC 를 만든 다음, 새로운 패키징 툴을 사용하여 "쿠킹" 하고 선택한 플랫폼에 맞게 콘텐츠를 최적화시킵니다.

이 기능은 게임의 **애셋 레지스트리** 를 활용하여 발매된 게임에 이미 제공된 콘텐츠가 무엇인지 알아낸 다음, 게임 콘텐츠에서 필요한 것들을 DLC 에 쿠킹해 넣습니다.

이 기능을 사용하려면, 메인 게임에 대한 쿠킹 유틸리티에 **-CreateReleaseVersion=x.y** 옵션을 붙여 실행한 다음, 각 DLC 플러그인에 대해 다시 **-BasedOnReleaseVersion=x.y -DLCName=MyPluginName** 옵션을 붙여 실행합니다.

#### Android 무비 재생
이제 **로딩 무비** 와 **스타트업 무비** 가 Android 디바이스에서 재생됩니다! **프로젝트 세팅** 에서 재생할 스타트업 무비 설정이 가능합니다.

Android 무비는 정상 재생을 위해 **MP4** 포맷이어야 합니다. 또한 무비 재생 기능은 Android 4.0 이상의 디바이스가 필요합니다.

#### 에디터에서 Android SDK 경로 셋업
Android 개발에 필요한 SDK 컴포넌트 위치 설정을 프로젝트 세팅의 "Andoird SDK" 섹션에서 바로 할 수 있게 되었습니다. 초기 셋업 절차를 대폭 간소화시킬 수 있습니다!

![](AndroidSDKpath.png)

이 세팅은 이미 설정된 환경 변수를 덮어씁니다 (원래 방식이 마음에 드는 경우 공란으로 비워두면 환경 변수를 사용합니다).

#### 편집불가 블루프린트 변수 접근
다른 블루프린트의 변수를 "Editable", 편집가능으로 만들지 않고도 다시금 접근할 수 있게 되었습니다. 이는 4.6 에서 이미 가능했으나, 4.7 에서는 안됐었습니다. 그 점 사과드립니다!

#### AI 블랙보드 동기화
블랙보드 애셋에 정의된 키는 이제 'synced' (동기화됨) 마킹을 통해 그것을 사용하는 모든 AI 에 걸쳐 그 값을 동기화시킬 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 복수의 AI 에 작동방식을 동기화시키거나, 그 사이의 통신에 사용할 수도 있습니다.

## General Release Notes

#### Rendering
* New: Preview Mobile Rendering right in the editor!
	* The "Feature Level Preview" option is no longer experimental
	* Use 'Settings->Preview Rendering Level' menu option to change the feature level used in the main editor window.
* New: Distance Field lighting features now support instanced static meshes and foliage (Ambient Occlusion, Ray Traced Shadows)
* New: Improved sky specular occlusion for the Two Sided Foliage shading model. Applies AO directly instead of doing the reflection cone vs bent normal intersection.
* New: Raised the default shadow map resolution to 2048, which allows higher resolution shadows
* New: Landscape causes Distance Field Ambient Occlusion on other parts of the scene, but no self-shadowing
	* Pixels without a distance field representation like Landscape can now receive occlusion with reasonable performance
* New: GPU object management of Distance Field meshes, can handle 100x more meshes with only a small GPU cost for culling
	* The CPU uploads scene change deltas only, nothing per frame
* New: Tangent bases for static meshes are now computed using MikkTSpace. Special thanks to JedTheKrampus for the GitHub pull request.
* New: Added the BC4 texture format to OpenGL on all platforms that support GL_ARB_texture_compression_rgtc.
* New: Added "Disabled LODs Keep Emitter Alive" to particle emitters. When true, this will cause any disabled LODs to keep the emitter alive so that the system is not considered complete. This keeps the emitter alive so that it will reactivate when re-entering a closer, active LOD.
* New: Added missing shadow rendering policies for mobile, including lightmaps with directional lights and cascaded shadows.
* New: New primitive component setting "Affect Distance Field Lighting" (disable this for small clutter objects)
* New: Marked members of Custom Mesh Triangles (used by CustomMeshComponent) as 'BlueprintReadWrite' to allow them to be created easily in a Blueprint.
* New: Added Set Occlusion Tint and Set Min Occlusion Blueprint functions to Skylight Components
* New: Subsurface scattering is now enabled when using the OpenGL RHI
* New: The UVs of sprite and GPU sprite particles can now be flipped at spawn time. This feature is available in the required module of emitters.
* The selected preview rendering level selected in the editor will now be retained when you create or open a different map

* Improved the world aligned texture material functions method for correcting projected normal maps.
* Fixed crash that could occur when exporting a texture with a maximum size of 64 or less.
* Fixed renderer reallocating scene render targets when rendering scene captures outside of the editor. This change improves performance in the standalone game.
* Fixed Distance Field Ambient Occlusion enabled in ortho viewports
* Emitters with one LOD disabled were assumed to be complete and so the enabled LODs were not showing when they should. Emitters with any enabled LODs remain active so this does not happen.

* Fixed a crash when dragging a skylight or reflection capture when the "no precomputed visibility" warning was turned on
* Fixed a rare race condition crash when using reflection capture render targets.
* Fixed a small memory leak in particle systems
* Fixed an issue causing particles using the Skel/Vert/Surf module in cascade to spawn at the origin.

* Fixed incorrect aspect ratio when using constrained aspect cameras with mobile's post processing chain.
* Fixed incorrect handling of light volumes and levels after feature level switch.
* Fixed issue where collision channel on emitters would not work correctly after a reload.
* Fixed issue which caused Orient Mesh Emitters to not work correctly in cascade's Skel/Vert/Surf module.
* Fixed issue with Mixamo Fuse characters having incorrect bone weights
* Fixed lighting not being fully built with static meshes with LODs that are fully shadowed from a stationary light

* Fixed potential crash when reading from reflection texture that was not ready. (affects SM4 only)
* Fixed rare crash bug in masked material compilation.
* Fixed a situation that could cause legitimate mobile preview shaders to fail compile. (Shaders were compiled against the deferred path, erroneously requiring more samplers than is available with ES2.)
* Fixed Skeletal Mesh rendering with a tessellated Material
* Fixed Subsurface Scattering Profile half resolution rendering
* Fixed swizzled UV1 for tessellation and displacement
* Fixed visible seams in landscape caused by LOD discontinuities between neighboring components in different streaming levels, and while texture streaming.

* The high resolution screenshot capture region rendering now correctly updates the gbuffer referencing counting system, fixing an occasional crash
* Various fixes have been made to the behaviour of fullscreen game windows when using Alt-Tab to switch to different applications. The window should now return to it's previous state when switching back into the game.
* Fixed text render actors becoming invisible when they are close to the player
* Fixed skeletal meshes rendered with a tessellated Material causing excessive blur
* Fixed render targets rendering with stretched pixels in standalone and launched games
* Fixed incorrect rendering of scene captures in section 1.7 of Content Examples Reflection map sample.

* The breadcrumb bar on the content browser now scrolls to the right to make the most child folder you're in always visible, instead of the most root folder.
* The Mesh Proxy tool now exports Base Color textures in the correct color space
* Placed limits on the sizes of font textures which can be generated when changing the Distance Field Scale Factor, preventing editor crashes for out-of-range values.
* The interior portion of the rotation gizmo no longer captures clicks when translucent selection is enabled
* Added some extra checks to close any open asset editors that may be editing play in editor lifetime objects when exiting play in editor, so that they don't hold on to invalid references.
* Fixed components on PIE instances of actors re-registering their properties change. This fix allows you to modify properties of actors during PIE (through the normal details panel in the level editor) and not lose all your state. 
* Fixed crash in Project Settings when changing default Game Mode from one that no longer exists.
* Fixed the edit/extrude BSP operation in Geometry Mode with multiple selected brushes, so that all geometry elements move in the expected direction. Also fixed scaling of BSP surfaces in the limited case that there is exactly one surface selected.

	* e.g. Given a landscape with built static lighting, sculpting the landscape (invalidating the lightmap), undoing (restoring the lightmap), then redoing (re-invalidating the lightmap) would crash

#### Content Browser
* New: The content browser in the default layout of the editor has been moved so that it is placed along the bottom of the editor to give it more room.
	* This will only affect new projects. To see this with an existing project, you must reset your layout via the "Edit" menu in the editor
* New: Added a new dialog for adding features previously only available as project templates, and content previously only available as starter content to an existing open project.
* New: Add an editor setting 'Log Timestamp Mode' that controls how timestamps are formatted and displayed or omitted in the output log
* New: Added a play button to tutorial assets in the Content Browser so that the tutorial can be played directly without opening the asset.

* Fixed an issue where large content browsers would become unusably slow due to rendering asset thumbnails.
* Fixed tooltip when creating a new Level via the Content Browser.

#### Unreal Motion Graphics (UI)
* New: Added snapping options to the UMG animation timeline.
* New: Added rulers to the UMG designer to give users a sense of size.
* New: When adding widgets to the viewport, you can now, as an advanced parameter, choose the ZOrder. Additionally ZOrder has been added as an option to the Widget Component. Widget Components now correctly take resolution quality/scale into account when positioning the widget on the screen.
* New: Helper lines are now drawn when moving the anchor gizmo. Along with percentage text, this information now appears on hover of the anchor medallion pieces.
* Create widgets that take a player controller now return null from instead of crashing if the player controller is not local (e.g not a remote player in a multiplayer session).
* Fixed a crash initializing a Dynamic Mesh Builder for each view in a UMG widget component.
* Copy / Paste of widgets now should remember the each copied widgets size when pasting
* New: Exposing the ability to configure Max Interactable Distance and Draw Size of the Widget Component to Blueprints and C++ at runtime.
* New: Get All Widgets Of Class added to the widget blueprint library. Allows accessing all widgets in the current world, optionally allows just getting the top level ones in the viewport.
* New: The 3D Widget Component now allows you to specify a Pivot (defaults to center, 0.5,0.5), old assets load with the original (defaults to 0,0, upper left).
	* Now allows Space to be specified. The default is world space, which renders in the world. You can also now select Screen, which will spawn it into the viewport, but places the widget based on world to screen projection of the component.
* New: A play button is now visible in the designer, just like in the graph view.
* New: The Scroll Box now has Scroll to End and Scroll To Start blueprint callable functions.
* New: The Widget Reflector can detect UMG widgets as being different than normal slate widgets, and the source link is replaced by a link back to the blueprint asset.
Animations on widget blueprints can now be looped a specified number of times (or indefinitely)
The Details panel in the designer view now correctly shows the selected widgets properties after going to the graph and then returning to the designer.
The DPI Scaling settings for UMG now properly label the axis that each value represents.
When renaming an animation we now also check for a valid variable name as well as checking collisions with other members of the blueprint. This prevents a common crash when renaming animations to match other members in the widget.
Widgets are now selected after being placed.
Fixed poor performance when using screen space widgets coming from components. We no longer attempt to recreate them every frame, and then remove them from the viewport.
* Made some improvements to Drag/Drop.:
* Now allows you to choose a pivot, and offset.
	* The drag data can no longer be Garbage Collected while the drag is being performed.
	* The drag pivot now defaults to Center,Center. 
	* In order to reduce drag/drop popping on begin drag there is now a small interpolation that occurs to move the object to the chosen pivot/offset.	
	* The Default Drag Visual is now correctly marked as ReadOnly.
* Fixed several UMG designer bugs when resizing, moving, re-anchoring widgets.
* You can no longer construct of abstract widget classes using the CreateWidget blueprint node. If the class has the abstract flag, CreateWidget will return null.
* Fixed text or checkbox state changes not being remembered when a UMG widget's slate widget is recreated.
* Fixed a crash that occurs when compiling a UMG widget without any animations, and without the timeline/animations visible. Causes an object to be garbage collected. We now report the object reference to prevent GC.
* Fixed a crash that would occur in UMG when adding an event handler to a widget after editing a value on the widget that caused a Garbage Collection.
* Fixed a crash when the animation tab is removed from UMG, future runs would fail to initialize the binding object the edtior would crash.
* Fixed an editor crash and memory corruption issue that occurs when UMG 3D Components have been placed in the level and the widget they spawn is recompiled with certain changes.
	* Restructuring the way external blueprint compilers are registered so that they can properly wait until all compiling has finished to do re-registering of components and complete other post compile work.
* Fixed an intermittent crash in the Designer that occurs during compile when you have an item in a canvas panel selected.
* Fixed many problems with the String Combobox. Updating/Refreshing issues as well as crash bugs when clearing the list.
* Fixed several crashes in the hierarchy view from edge cases not being accounted for when moving widgets around.
* Fixed spelling of Visibility on widgets. Now using a class enum with a specified size, this appears to fix the issue with visibility bindings returning bogus values on the stack, likely due to it being seen as an int32 vs. uint8 sized value in different places.
* Fixed a bug in the UMG animation timeline where resizing a keyframe section to zero would make it uneditable.
* Fixed 3D UMG UI widgets from appearing as a green quad for one frame when they become visible.
* Fixed a bug where renaming UMG widgets to a used name in the hierarchy could cause a crash.
* Fixed a bug where you couldn't safely access the certain functionality of a UMG Widget in the On Constructed callback.
* Fixed a crash that could happen while transitioning to PIE (Play In Editor) with a UMG editor open
* Fixed UMG UI Widget recompiles not updating 3D widgets in the world when not in realtime rendering mode
* Named slots to no longer disappear when PIE occurs.
* Removed binding options on the Root of a widget since they were not expected to work.
* It is now safe to call IsPressed on a button before it has been added to the screen.
* All UMG widgets when adding to the viewport now start at z-order 10 instead of 0
	* This ensures all UMG items always appear above items added by the engine like the virtual joystick on mobile. 
	* This prevents a common issue people encounter with UMG, having their UIs get interleaved with the virtual joystick, which absorbs all hits. 
* The Virtual joystick is now able to lock the finger index when clicked allowing it to work with other UI on the screen and now lose capture if your finger moves over other UI elements.
* Fixed a crash on recompile of widget blueprints if the editor is not yet available.

#### Animation
* New: Added double buffering for the bone transforms on Skinned Mesh Components.
	* This solves issues when you use a bone transform while it has not yet finished being modified by the animation system. Now the animation system waits until everything is complete (including physics simulation being blended in) before updating the public bone transforms.
* New: Added a new option to Anim Notifies context menu in Persona that will open the source blueprint for that notify (if it came from a blueprint).
* New: Added warning to Persona to make it more obvious that changes to preview properties will not be saved in the asset
* New: We now support blueprints and AnimNotify_State as branching points!
* Branching Points refactor. BranchingPoints are now regular AnimNotifies, with their MontageTickType set to 'BranchingPoint' instead of 'Queued'. 
* New: Added the Static Mesh Morph Target MAXScript to Engine/Extras/3DSMAXScripts
* New: Removed Blueprint Notify for State Transition Event
* New: Removed the user driven path to create rigid meshes and instead made the FBX importer automatically attempt to import a rigid mesh if a skeletal mesh appears to have no bone hierarchy.
* New: Fixed a bug related to dynamic parameters on mesh particle emitters, that could cause a crash under certain circumstances.
* New: Added the ability to create a blueprint from the Trail Notify State where you can then override the default particle system template by implementing the OverridePSTemplate function.
* Hid the backward/forward buttons in the animation asset browser when in Anim Blueprint edit mode, giving more vertical space for the asset list
* Fixed crash with index mismatches often after skeleton retargeting or reimport.
* Fixed a crash when right-clicking on variable nodes inside state machine transition rules
* Prevented editing preview properties in Persona when stopped at a breakpoint as it is unsafe

* Fixed various crashes with the Landscape Copy/Paste tools
* Fixed visual issues with landscape LOD in release builds when LOD Falloff is set to Square Root
* In the landscape editor using the "clear gizmo data" button now also removes any copied gizmo data from the clipboard.
	* This fixes previous gizmo content appearing again when entering the copy/paste tool even if it had previously been cleared

#### Matinee
* Fixed existing duplicate matinee groups not being overridden when importing new tracks over the top

#### Cascade
* New: Added a color property for Vector / Vector Random parameter types in particle instance parameters.

* Fixed an issue where the foliage UI showed outdated settings after changing the Static Mesh on a foliage type.
* Fixed issue applying changes made to shared foliage settings objects to instances already existing in levels
	* After making changes to a shared foliage settings object, such as modifying collision or lighting properties, those changes were not applied to levels that were not open when the property was changed.
	* Changes to shared foliage settings will now be applied to instances in levels that were not open at the time the change was made.
* Fixed rendering corruption such as yellow lines seen when using the foliage selection tools on foliage instances using a World Position Offset material.
* Fixed the ability to disable static lighting on foliage
	* It is no longer necessary to override the "Light Map Resolution" to 0, which didn't work correctly
	* This is now a separate "Enable Static Lighting" checkbox
* Foliage painted on BSP is now associated with the Brush actor rather than the generated BSP mesh.
	* Instances will now move when you move the BSP brush.
	* This also fixes an issue where instances painted on BSP would disappear after a rebuild.
	* Note that this applies only to newly-painted foliage and existing instances could still be associated with the BSP mesh instead of the brush actor. You can fix existing instances by selecting them with the Lasso tool, moving them above the BSP and then pressing the End key to snap them to the floor again.
* The foliage "Light Map Resolution" override now defaults to 8, as the previous default of 32 was impractical for both memory usage and build time

#### Paper2D

* New: Added support for merging tile map layers down on to lower layers (the command is in the context-menu on layer items in the layer browser)
* New: Allow adding additional vertices on top of an existing edge in the sprite editor (Shift+click always adds rather than preferentially selecting existing proxies)
* New: Improved sprite extraction behavior by generating a much better ordering for sprite sheets (it now sorts rectangles by row and names each with an explicit desired number suffix)
* New: Improved comments and exposed various properties from tile map assets and components to Blueprints
* New: The tile map editor now keeps track of the last selected tile set for a tile map and defaults the tile set viewer to that asset when it is reopened

* Tile maps and associated assets can now be created in any project without having to enable a setting
* Added support for the DoesSocketExist interface to flipbook and sprite components
* Made the flipbook asset type color green instead of cyan, so it is distinct from sprite assets
* Added a property restriction to prevent sprite collision geometry type from being set to Diced, which is an ignored value for collision geometry
* Adding a new layer to a tile map now inserts the layer above/below the selection, instead of always adding it at the end of the layer list
* Change asset type colors for tile maps to gold and tile sets to orange so they don't conflict with sprite assets
* Fixed an issue that prevented smooth panning of tile set preview viewports
* Fixed an issue when rendering orthogonal tile maps that was causing them to appear in the wrong place (off by one full tile)
* Fixed bounding volume on tile map components to properly account for layer depth, preventing the components from being accidentally culled
* Fixed flipbook thumbnail preview bounds zooming in/out from frame to frame (now uses the union render bounds for all frames)
* Fixed incorrect math in tile map editing intersection code that caused editing to feel inconsistent
* Fixed tile map layer visibility toggles not taking effect immediately
* Fixed z-fighting on tile map edit mode cursor preview
* Improved display message when no ink is selected in tile map edit mode
* Prevented drawing the grid lines for the selected layer in a tile map when there are no layers
* Prevented pivot cross from being drawn in tile map edit mode
* Selecting a tile from a tile set now takes effect immediately on mouse down, allowing click-and-release without dragging to work as expected, selecting a single tile
* Significant optimization to sprite importing speed when there are many sprite instances already in the level (from 10 minutes to 18 seconds in some test cases)
* Tile map layer edits now cause placed tile map components using the layer to reinstance, reflecting changes immediately
* Tile selection improvements
	* Tile selection now works on the right and bottom edges of a tile set
	* Changing the active tile set now updates the selection preview appropriately
* Tile map editing mode is now activated only when pressing "Enter Edit Mode" on a tile map, and can be left by selecting a different actor or switching to another mode. It no longer shows up in the always-visible modes list of the editor since it is selection-dependent.

#### Gameplay Framework
* New: Input Components and Actors can now specify an Input Priority value. This gives more fine-grained control over the order in which they get to handle input.
	* For C++ this is generally handled by setting the priority value directly on the Input Component prior to pushing it on the Player Controller's input stack.
	* For Blueprints this is set in its defaults.
	* Note that this only applies to Actors/Components that have their input Enabled dynamically, it does not affect the order in which the automatically enabled Pawn, Controller, and Level Script Blueprint inputs are processed.

	* Previously the default (and only) behavior was to possess on level startup.
	* Renamed existing "Auto Possess" to "Auto Possess Player" for clarity and to distinguish from the new AI flag.
* New: Added Get Materials function for SkeletalMeshComponent and StaticMeshComponent so that it works consistently with the Get Material function on components.

* Changed HUD drawing functions now use a default alpha of 1 (meaning opaque) instead of 0 (meaning transparent).
* Changed "Player State Class" variable in Game Mode to no longer be 'Advanced'.
* Characters placed in a level without an AI Controller Class but with "Run Physics With No Controller" set to true in their Character Movement Component will now initialize the default movement mode.
	* Previously those Characters would float in the air because movement mode was initialized to "None".
* End Overlap is now called not just when an Actor is Destroyed, but also when it is Removed from World by streaming out the Level it belongs to.
* Fixed major stall when moving from one tutorial stage to the next
* Fixed a divide by zero crash when setting field of view to zero on a camera
* Fixed a case where sub-levels were not always fully loaded before the player spawns
* Fixed an edge case where loading with a movie could cause a crash due to a frame without a viewport.
* Fixed an issue where collision profile isn't showing correctly when checking out the config file the first time
* Fixed character movement when standing on a non-root component that is destroyed. Previously it would teleport the player near the origin.

* Fixed network clients moving incorrectly when they have "Run Physics With No Controller" enabled and they are possessed by a player.
	* The server was running the movement code locally as well as when receiving the client's move, so would send a correction to the client causing jittery client updates.
* Fixed occasional crash after traveling from a standalone map into to a world composition map during PIE
* Fixed tutorial nodes not safely checking for focus
* Fixed tutorial welcome bubble constantly reappearing due to a bug with the close handler

	* Also improved the comment to make it more clear that Capsule Half Height must be more than Capsule Radius.
* Fixed several bugs with collision drawing not updating correctly when editing static mesh collision.
* Fixed the physics collision drawing code so that it properly applies the supplied scale factor when rendering solid boxes, fixing flickering assets in the Player Collision View mode.

![](Androidpackaging.png)
	* Please review your Android Project Settings and make changes as needed.
	* AndroidManifest.xml is re-generated every time you package (your original file stored in your project is safe, we just don't use it).
	* All of the relevant settings are now saved in .ini files, which you would check in to share with your team.
	* The settings that were read from SigningConfig.xml are now stored in your .ini file as well (and are stripped out during packaging).

	* Any special settings you may need can be added to the "Extra PList Data" section.
* New: Iteration times have been improved when utilizing the Launch On feature. Launch On now uses Cook in the Editor and Incremental Deploy to decrease iteration times after the first deploy. This can decrease deploy times to devices down to 10-15 seconds depending on the amount of content changes that have been made since the last use of Launch On.
* New: Addition of Provision and Certificate viewer in the iOS Project Settings. This view shows users what provision and certificates are currently and installed, which ones are valid (in green) or expired and which provision and certificate will be selected for code signing.
	* The expiration date of the certificate is displayed for convenience.
	* The status message for provisions shows the current state of the provision as well as why it was not selected for code signing.

* New: Added very early implementation of the deferred (desktop) renderer to Metal (for A8X devices). It is known in the code as MetalMRT. It can be enabled in iOS project settings (for GitHub/Perforce users).
* New: Devices that use Metal now render static instanced meshes using hardware acceleration
* New: Project compile settings can now be specified in IOSEngine.ini. This feature is experimental and can only be used by creating and editing the file manually. This file has no effect on content-only projects in the binary release.
* Added a DeviceProfile for iPad Air 2 to BaseDeviceProfiles.ini
* iOS games now overwrite the game log every time instead of creating a new log for each run.

* Fixed going into fullscreen mode in the Editor using the system titlebar button on Mac OS X.
* Fixed rendering on the ATi 4000 series of GPUs under Mac OS X.
	* These GPUs don't support combined depth/stencil clears in glClearBuffer, so perform separate depth then stencil clears instead.
	* Disable Depth-Fetch-During-Depth-Test as it doesn't work on these GPUs.
* Fixed the Editor on OpenGL 3.3 GPUs under Mac OS X by disabling translucent volume lighting as they cannot perform volume rendering.
* Fixed the rendering of point-lights on Intel HD GPUs under Mac OS X.
	* On Mac OS X we have to use more branches and constant index values to avoid a bug in the Intel GLSL compiler that leads to reading the wrong value from the shader's uniform array.
* Fixed a bug in Mac OpenGL initialization code that was setting incorrect height for some windows
* Fixed a bug that caused context menu stay open, but invisible, when the editor was deactivated
* Fixed a crash in UnrealFrontend caused by GPU switching on MacBook Pros with dual GPUs

###### Playstation 4
* New: Deployed applications are now sandboxed on the device. The deploy process is now iterative. The Launch On workflow for PS4 is now much faster!
* New: Companion App support is now controlled by a Project Setting. The default is no Companion App support.
* New: First draft of experimental parallel rhi execution! Disabled by default. Should only be enabled for testing if curious as big optimizations will be coming in the next release!
* New: Frame management has been modified to improve Morpheus headtracking accuracy.
* New: Logs and Screenshots are now always written to the PS4's local hadrdrive in Debug and Development builds. Installed packages of these build types now properly write out logs and screenshots.
* New: TestKits now support keyboard input.
* Fixed a crash when capturing reflections in levels with large numbers of reflection capture actors.
* Fixed Follow HMD Rotation for Morpheus builds. The behavior is now consistent with other HMD plug-ins
* Fixed bug causing Launch from editor to read from the hostpc rather than the deployed files.
* Fixed crashes caused by using a fileserver when the working directory is set to a staged directory.

	* We now support pausing
	* Better handling of spectator time dilation cancelling (use Ignore Time Dilation on movement component)
* The Game Session instance set in Game Mode is preserved through seamless travel to prevent crashes if a new player joins during this period
* Added the ability to detect when we are re-opening an actor channel that was previously closed but we were still processing queued bunches. This fixes issues where property replication could end up out of order.
* Cleaned up network demo file format, which will help with adding future options (checkpoints, streaming, etc)
* Implemented a more robust way to reset references to objects over the network during multiplayer gameplay. This should fix issues where you would see the server or client warn that references couldn't be resolved soon after a seamless travel.
* We no longer assert/crash when an actor fails to create. This will however leave the actor channel as invalid (the actor will be missing on the client).
* We no longer disconnect a client from the server when the server sends the client an invalid sub-object
	* We instead try to recover, and warn in the output logs instead.
	* However a server will disconnect clients that send the server an invalid sub-object. This is due to security concerns.
* Fixed crash that could occur when replicating a blank Text struct
* Fixed a bug that was causing actor components to not replicate properly during Play In Editor sessions.
* Fixed a bug that was causing the client/server to report their connection was still active when it no longer was

* Fixed a crash that could occur on clients when processing and updating unmapped properties on connections that were just closed
* Fixed a crash that could occur when replicating properties to clients
* Fixed an issue that could occur when shutting down actor channels
* Fixed an issue that could occur when tracking unmapped object references for native struct
* Fixed an issue where certain networking packets could get dropped due to incorrect sequencing logic
* Fixed an issue where object references in multicast RPC parameters could be NULL on the client (even if valid on the server)

* New: Added a material attribute output to the world aligned texture_complex function.
* New: Added a material node that will retrieve the screen and buffer resolution.
* New: Material Function RotateVector: Rotates an input vector to point toward a given direction.
* New: Material Function SkyboxImage: Projects an image onto an infinite sphere, useful for putting images in the skybox
* New: Material Function TriPlanarCameraVector: Applies a texture to the background, similar to a cubemap but uses the same 2d texture for all sides
* New: The Time material expression now supports a Period for wrapping around time; it will also evaluate this on the CPU for better precision on mobile projects.
* Deprecated the "Const A Equals B" material expression which was causing lines to appear down the middle of certain materials.
* Fixed focusing on the Preview Shape ('F' key) not correctly fitting the shape to the viewport
* The list of visible material instance parameters is now populated correctly when a material blueprint contains functions within functions.
* Fixed: Material instances using base property overrides now correctly inherit their parent's overrides rather than always using the base material's settings.
* New: Added a "Transform to Clip Space" material function
* The materials required for high resolution screenshot functionality are now only loaded when in the editor
* Fixed a bug that prevented user from double clicking on a shader compilation error for Materials.
* Fixed a crash bug that occurred when exporting materials. In doing so, refactored some code to allow material resources to create their own shader map IDs.
* Fixed deferred decal materials not appearing in game with the decal blend mode set to DBM_DBuffer_ColorNormalRoughness

#### VR
* New: Added the SimpleHMD plugin to the experimental plugins. This plugin can be used as a template for adding support for a new VR HMD device type. It renders in stereo with a fixed IPD and emulates a simple mesh based distortion if post-processing is enabled.
* New: Added an editor setting (Viewport Gets HMD Control) to allow users to use the Head Mounted Display orientation when in play-in-viewport mode
* New: Android builds can now target GearVR by enabling the GearVR plugin, and selecting the GearVR in the Android packaging project settings.
* Fixed camera behavior to be consistent across VR devices when Follow HMD Rotation is used. This setting should be used when attaching a player using a VR device to a moving platform or vehicle.
* Fixes a cooker crash if Morpheus is enabled for the project you are cooking.

#### Core
* New: Crash Report Client has been given a huge upgrade for better user experience after a crash!
* New: Crash Report data is now compressed to save bandwidth
* New: "-UserDir" command-line argument makes it easy to run multiple game instances from the same directory with different config files
* Improved the performance of duplicating Landscape-related objects.
* Fixed copying and pasting of properties of Actors with non-fully qualified paths
* Default config files no longer save over the file on disk twice after making changes in the "Project Settings"
* Duplicate data for the ICU internationalization library has been removed from the Engine/Content/Localization directory. The data remains in Engine/Content/Internationalization.
* Fixed issue where async loading a tightly connected web of assets would be extremely slow
* Fixed an issue with hot-reload not updating modified property values on default subobject properties in the constructor.
* Fixed an issue with the async io thread being starved when running on devices with only one core available.
* Fixed Crash Report Client not working in Windows 8.x
* Fixed issue on iOS where the OS language/region settings where not being properly used to set the engine's language/region.
* Fixed runnable threads overwriting the main thread's CPU core affinities. Runnable threads will now set their own core affinities properly.
* Fixed Unreal Swarm sometimes reporting an error that it can't access modules of a 64 bit process from a 32 bit process.
* Fixed a bug when Crash Report Client does not send all crash related files
* Fixed crash on shutdown. During the final garbage collection pass the classes (and their subobjects) are destroyed after all regular objects.
* Fixed a bug in the garbage collector where it would not call destructors on objects residing in permanent pool while performing exit purge.
* Fixed copy and paste of objects and actors not working when the property name contains a space.

## Programming Release Notes

#### AI
* Behavior Tree functions taking a BehaviorTreeComponent have been refactored to take references instead
* Added a little sanity check to make sure FEQSHelpers::FindNavMeshForQuery doesn't crash in the absence of any navmesh instances.
* New: Added a blueprint getter for NavigationSystem so that users can operate on the navigation system directly
* New: Added a RecastNavMesh function for calculating the distance to "wall" for a given location on navmesh
* New: Added functionality to navigation paths for querying the "direction" of a specified path segment
* Added a new behavior tree task class for handling pawn actions (BTTask_PawnActionBase)
* New: Added versions of UEnvQueryTest::GetItemActor that take the iterator rather then an integer to avoid silly mistakes of passing the Environment Query System item iterator without using the * operator, which used to result in always addressing the item at index 1
* New: Bits of Recast navmesh generation had been made more flexible to allow expansion by inherited classes.
* New: Virtual AIController::GetFocalPointOnActor has been added to allow game-specific AI controllers to modify the default behavior of focusing on the focus actor's location
* New: Added an auto restore feature for behavior tree assets that have a valid tree structure but their graph data was corrupted.
* New: Added ability to have a game-specific GameplayDebugger. It is now possible to add or modify keyboard bindings by deriving from UGameplayDebuggingControllerComponent and implementing BindAIDebugViewKeys.
* New: Added ability to set default settings for Gameplay Debugger during Simulate in the editor.
* New: Created an Environment Query System test for GameplayTags. This test requires an Item that derives from ActorBase; if no Actor is found or the Actor doesn't implement IGameplayTagAssetInterface, it will skip scoring for that item.
* UNavigationSystem::NavDataClasses and UNavigationSystem::RequiredNavigationDataClassNames have been removed.
* New: The navigation system now efficiently supports instanced static meshes and foliage
* Expanded AIController's movement request logging with information on the navigation filter used for easier debugging via Visual Logger
* Added a GetNavAgentLocation override to the Character class to have it return the feet's location rather than pelvis', which in the past was a source of subtle issues.
* Changed navigation octree creation policy so that it doesn't use up a game's memory when dynamic navmesh generation is not enabled
* Changed the signature of the FOnBlackboardChange delegate to require a reference to a BlackboardComponent rather than a pointer
* Changed the UNavMovementComponent::UpdateNavAgent signature to take references rather than pointers.
* Changed when Environment Query System queries' observers are being notified about a query finishing from inside the query processing loop to outside in a separate loop
* Environment Query System Logging: Changed the default LogEQS level from Log to Warning to prevent unnecessary spamming of the log in game.
* Environment Query System Logging: Generator "On Circle" no longer spams warnings if it has no center locations from which to generate items. Having no such candidates can be a valid case.
* Fixed crash related to Toggle AI Logging cheat.
* Fixed how Gameplay Debugger is drawing navigation-corridor-based AI paths.
* Fixed Gameplay Debugger initialization for Simulate to work correctly with pure Blueprint projects again.
* Gameplay Debugger no longer creates DebuggingReplicator in non-game worlds or in pending-kill worlds. It should fix a rare but possible crash.
* Fixed a bug in AI System where it tried to load subsystems' classes without checking if relevant StringClassReferences are empty
* Fixed a bug in the detour crowds wrapper that was resulting in a crash on the crowd's max size increasing
* Fixed a bug in resuming movement Pawn Action when GoalActor is pending kill that was causing a crash
* Fixed a bug in the AI perception system that allowed unsensed stimuli from being marked and registered as expired
* Fixed a crash when reporting AI perception events that no one was listening to
* Fixed compilation issues related to including CrowdAgentInterface.h in game-specific sources that 4.7 preview 2 users experienced.
* Fixed Project Settings not using game-specific NavigationSystem class if one has been implemented instead always making changes to UNavigationSystem's default object.
* Fixed UNavigationSystem::GetRandomPointInRadius always returning true if a NavigationData instance have been found, regardless of the actual result of the query
* Made PawnAction aborting be treated just like any other action event, meaning it's processed in PawnActionsComponent's tick rather than instantly
* Refactored INavAgentInterface::GetNavAgentProperties to return a reference rather than a pointer
* New: Removed the navigation component, which was acting as a proxy between the navigation system and AI agents
	* Paths will now handle updating themselves on destination change (moving actor)
	* Direct movement without path following will use special navigation data (AbstractNavData) for consistency
* Restricted Environment Query System queries from being added to the "current" queue while the queue is being processed. New queries are being accepted but won't be processed until the next tick.
* Added auto scaling of heuristic weight for pathfinding to compensate for areas with travel cost lower than 1.

#### Animation
* New: Added support for adding/reading 'AssetUserData' objects (via C++) to SkeletalMesh assets. This was already available for StaticMesh assets.
* Deleted some obsolete/unused LOD code (FLODSettingsWindow, FLODUtilities::ImportMeshLOD, and FLODUtilities::CreateLODSettingsDialog)

#### Audio
* New: Marked AudioVolume for export so it can be subclassed in other modules.
* Removed FAudioDevice::SetClassVolume and console command ModifySoundClass.
* Output from "ListSoundDurations" console command is now sent to the correct output location.
* Reduced possibility of cases where multiple wave instances generated by a Sound Cue could have the same hash value.
* Updated Audio Volume tests so that they use the listener location instead of the camera location.

#### Automation
* New: Automation functionality has been added that allows for the testing of the LaunchOn feature in the editor, requiring a user to specify a map and a platform to LaunchOn to.
	* To enable this test, update either the Engine.ini or Launch on Settings under Automation preferences with an appropriate "Launch on Testmap" and the DeviceId
	* Execution of this test can also be run with the following Command Line Syntax Example: 'FLaunchOnTest /Game/Path/To/MapName.MapName Platform@DeviceName'
* The individual open asset tests are now (only temporarily) simple tests.

#### Blueprints
* New: Blueprint runtime optimization:
	* Execution Flow Stack is used only when necessary
	* Number of jumps and gotos is reduced. Statements are sorted. Adjacent statements are merged.
* New: Mechanism to distinguish if instances of recompiled Blueprint Generated Class must be reinstanced. (BP compiler optimization)
* New: Allow any Blueprint subclassed from Actor or Component to tick by default
	* Added a new project setting "Can Blueprints Tick By Default", which defaults to true
	* Added a new class metadata flag ChildCannotTick, which can be used to prevent Blueprint subclasses from ticking
	* Improved the warning messages when ticking isn't possible
	* Blueprint subclasses are now allowed to tick as long as any of the following are true of the most derived C++ parent class:
		* C++ parent has bCanEverTick = true on their primary tick function
		* C++ parent is AActor or UActorComponent
		* C++ parent does not have ChildCannotTick metadata and bCanBlueprintsTickByDefault is true
		* C++ parent does not have ChildCannotTick metadata but does have ChildCanTick metadata
* Added utility methods to FBlueprintEditorUtils to get canonical display or root names for classes
	* GetClassNameWithoutSuffix removes the _C suffix on Blueprint generated classes, useful for generating roots of new names
	* GetFriendlyClassDisplayName looks for DisplayName metadata and potentially pulls a nice localized display name if one is available, falling back to removing _C when necessary
* Improved localization/display process for the quick Blueprint Parent Class choices in the NewAssetDefaultClasses ini key, which now use GetDisplayNameText and short tooltips instead of the hardcoded list in C++New: Blueprint Skeleton classes will now inherit their parent's Skeleton class, instead of the generated class.
* Component templates for AddComponent nodes in blueprints are now created as RF_Public.
* An Actor subclass that defines a native scene component without also explicitly setting the root component in C++ will no longer result in an invalid scene component hierarchy at construction time in a Blueprint that's based on that class.
* Added check to ensure that assign nodes can now only be placed in Macro graphs.
* Removed support for the Blueprint Save-On-Compile setting while running commandlets.
* Fixed a bug that caused properties marked BlueprintReadWrite to not be accessible in Blueprints (unless marked EditAnywhere).
* Fixed a bug where natively inherited interface functions were not shown in Blueprint node menus.
* Fixed crash caused by unresolveable ClassGeneratedBy
* Fixed stale skeleton generated class when compiling certain blueprints, resulted in TRASHCLASS compilation
* New: For native C++ methods declared as 'const' and tagged as BlueprintImplementableEvent, the Blueprint Graph view in the editor will now enforce a read-only state (i.e. 'self' cannot be modified). This allows the programmer to exercise some additional control over the implementation side.
* Made the implicitly created Blueprint Component variables non-transactional.
* New compilation error: "Static array cannot be exposed to blueprint"
* Added support for class metadata IgnoreCategoryKeywordsInSubclasses, which prevents inheritance of showCategories, hideCategories, AutoExpandCategories, and AutoCollapseCategories metadata when placed on the immediate parent of a Blueprint
* Added a new UCLASS() specifier ComponentWrapperClass, which implies IgnoreCategoryKeywordsInSubclasses metadata
* Demoted some IsValidLowLevel checks in pin watching code to once-per-session ensures to avoid crashing the editor in (still-)invalid cases where we can probably recover

#### Core
* New: Added a basic native Visual Studio visualizer for class FStatMessage, may be useful for debugging the stats system
* New: Teams using the engine through Git submodules can now set the EngineAssociation field in .uproject files to a relative path. The default behavior for local builds is still to use GUID strings for local source builds, though this will likely change in a future release.
* New: Faster engine compile times after reducing the number of includes in main engine global headers
* New: Commandlets can now be authored to be run using a Game executable, not just Editor executables.
* New: Generating new Visual Studio project files will collapse each project in the solution by default.
* New: Parsing options with arguments now supports fully quoted strings, e.g. "-Option=Value"
* New: Start-up stats (-LoadTimeStats) will dump the results after 240 frames, there is no need to stop it manually
* New: Added several visual studio code snippets to the source release.
* New: Added support for optional localizable short tooltip metadata
	* The short tooltip can be specified as metadata on the associated field macro (UCLASS, UPROPERTY, etc...) as meta=(ShortTooltip="The short tooltip")
	* UField::GetToolTipText now takes an optional parameter to indicate if the short tooltip is desired, but will fall back to the long tooltip if none was specified
* New: Adding "GetSignVector" to FVector2D
* New: Adding code to a Blueprint-only project will now automatically compile and load the new module without the need to restart the editor.
* New: Allowed use of "explicit operator x" in Visual Studio 2013+
* New: Assertion macros make debugger stop in current stack frame instead of Core internals.
* CastChecked no longer checks in Shipping builds and assumes the cast is legal.
* New: BuildPatchTool can now take a file path to a text file listing attributes. Currently supports readonly and compressed. See main cpp commenting.
* New: ClosestPointOnSegment2D function into FMath
* Deprecated 'operator new' for UObject-derived classes.
* New: FArchive subclasses can now implement a ShouldSkipProperty function to do custom filtering on properties. This cannot avoid filtering properties that normally would have been filtered, but can filter additional properties that would not have.
* New: Faster C++ iteration: UnrealHeaderTool no longer needs to run unless your change a source file with an Unreal class in it
* This makes it much faster to iterate on source files that UCLASS's or USTRUCT's aren't declared in
* New: GitDependencies now supports HTTP proxies via the -proxy=, -proxy-user=, and -proxy-password= command line options.
* Added an additional optional param to OsExecute so that cmdline params can easily be passed to the ShellExecute function too.
* Added cumulative stats of total time spent in FAsyncPackage::Tick(), FAsyncPackage::PostLoadObjects() and FlushAsyncLoading() functions.
* Added a safeguard check to make sure the name of created package does not contain double slashes.
* Added an Ini file cache to speed up loading parallel ini hierarchies (each platforms load and process most of the same .ini files when processing their final values)
* Added documentation for MultiLine property metadata in ObjectBase.h
	* This metadata can be specified on FString and FText properties, indicating that editors should allow multiple lines of text to be entered
* All runtime plugins now include static libraries for monolithic games, not just those which are enabled by default.
* Delegate comparisons, and any functions which use delegates as a form of identification, have been deprecated and replaced with handle-based systems.
* FAsyncPackage's PackageName has been changed from FString to FName to reduce the overhead of string comparisons in async loading code.
* FCoreUObjectDelegates::OnObjectModified is now called only once per frame for each unique object that has Modify() called on it. This improves performance for some editor operations.
* Improved FIntPoint's hash function. The old hash function (FMemCrc_Deprecated) was showing up in profiles of the landscape editing code.
* Made sure some of the most frequently constructed FNames are static to avoid the overhead of looking up existing FName
* Removed obsolete method QuantizeSize from memory allocator classes
* Removed obsolete UEBuildConfiguration.bBuildDedicatedServer and replaced it with Target.Type.Value == TargetRules.TargetType.Server which is more accurate.
* Removed stale GameName ini entries. [URL] GameName section in ini files is no longer used.
* Track Icon in Interpolation Tracks classes will no longer be cooked or used in cooked builds as it is only required in the editor.
* Call PollGameDeviceState during WaitForMovieToFinish so touch/controller events are processed, allowing MoviesAreSkippable to work.
* Changed MinimumLoadingScreenDisplayTime default to -1 to allow wait for movie completion to work.
* Config Ini Hierarchy cache respects the force reload hints.
* CRCs in code generated by UnrealHeaderTool will now match across platforms for the same source code. This should fix native package GUID differences when playing multiplayer games across different platforms.
* Fixed config file parsing issue that prevents urls of the form http:// from saving properly
* Fix for TArray<>:RemoveSingle which would incorrectly reconstruct elements currently in the array after the element being removed. Could cause leak in elements are of type TSharedPtr/Ref..
* Fixed a crash that may happen in the stats system as a result of Render Thread ID not being initialized early enough.
* Fixed a misleading error message when objects have the same fully qualified name but different paths to no longer strip off the number suffix from a FName
* Fixed a problem with FFileManagerGeneric::Copy corrupting files on Unix platforms if Source and Destination paths were the same
* Fixed certain cases where exporting a non-fully qualified path Object path name could end up fully qualified.
* Fixed check() when cvars are getting set in a certain order
* Fixed crash caused by FLegacyTextHelper::Format mutating the static empty FText instance
* Fixed FArchive::SerializeCompressed serializing wrong size of the compressed buffer
* Fixed potential divide-by-zero in FindBounds function for splines.
* Fixed Reserve/Empty methods in class TChunkedArray not reserving/emptying the correct number of items
* Fixed UWorld::RemovePIEPrefix to not return uninitialized value in some cases.
* Stopped the Crash Reporter always being staged when packaging via the editor
	* The crash reporter used to get packaged for all projects, but it is now only packaged for blueprint based projects.
	* It can also be excluded on a per-project basis via the "Include Crash Reporter" project packaging setting.
* The HTML output of the fpschart profiling command can now be used in a cooked build
* Gathering text from assets will no longer access elements of a native fixed-sized FText array improperly.
* Made more use of GET_MEMBER_NAME_CHECKED to catch code looking for removed/renamed variables by name.
* Made sure that running UnrealAutomationTool while the editor is running does not trigger hot-reload path in UnrealBuildTool.
* Method GetAllocatedSize in class TIndirectArray will return the correct size.
* Restored InterpEaseInOut functionality, which was accidentally removed
* SafeCopyFile's timestamp check now allows a variation of 2 seconds to prevent copy failure on exFAT.
* Staging settings for packaging games now accept cultures to stage in both hyphenated and underscored forms. IE: en-US or en_US are valid.
* Fixed a memory leak in the Stats system
* Switched SQLite module to use UTF8 instead of UTF16 to make it more compatible with iOS.
* TIndirectArray's Reserve and Empty functions will now reserve and empty the correct number of items.
* Fixed a crash when performing hot-reload after removing code responsible for creating default subobject from class constructor without removing the subobject property.
* Fixed a crash when performing hot-reload in a project that has deprecated UObject-derived classes.
* Fixed an error related to environment variables which could prevent UnrealBuildTool from starting up
* Fixed an infinite loop when performing hot-reload in some situations.
* Fixed bug where Unreal Build Tool could generate bad reflection code when bEnableFastBuildIteration was enabled
* Fixed hot reload not actually reloading game modules in some cases
* Fixed hot-reload sometimes crashing after adding new properties to classes.
* Fixed math numeric limits function for doubles returning the wrong value (TNumericLimits::Max)
* Fixed splitting UHT generated CPP files.
* Fixed two problems connected with FStringClassReference property in C++:
	* If the user set the property to some class and then set it back to None it would show up as a valid one (using IsValid() method).
	* If the user forgot to mention MetaClass in UPROPERTY macro in C++ the editor would crash.
* Fixed UnrealBuildTool Clean not deleting all project-specific intermediate files
* Fixed very slow compile times of some engine source files with Slate widgets
* Fixed a bug where the Media Player would not render any imagery
* New: Greatly improved the quality of C++ IDE code completion and error checking with Unreal Engine C++ projects
	* Xcode and Visual Studio projects will now have more reliable IntelliSense results
	* We now emit compiler definitions and include paths for editor targets (instead of runtime targets), which are much more inclusive
	* Fixed project targets "infecting" IntelliSense definitions of other target's project files
* Fixed an issue where Hot-Reload was failing if UClassA::StaticClass() was used in constructor of UClassB, and UClassA and UClassB was in the same reloaded module.
* New: If the user adds a reference in a class constructor using ConstructorHelpers namespace to an asset that doesn't exist, the resulting warning on startup will now also include the class name where it was referenced.
* New: If the user changes property values in a constructor of an UObject-derived class, the properties will now be propagated to all existing instances of that class after hot-reload.
* Improved compile times by no longer requiring Slate headers to be included in game modules
	* This nearly halves the time it takes to recompile small game projects!
	* Games that included EngineMinimal.h no longer get Slate header includes. You need to include those yourself.
	* Note that if your game previously used Slate features in C++, you may need to manually add includes for SlateCore.h or SlateBasics.h
* Fixed LinkerLoad circular dependency issue by ensuring that any parent default subobjects have been loaded before trying to create a CDO.
	* Fixes components in derived blueprints not inheriting default values from their parent blueprint.
* Made UBT generate a lot shorter command line for the compiler when compiling UELinkerFixups generated file to prevent the compiler from failing due to command line being too long.
* Mark three-argument form of FPropertyChangedEvent as deprecated.
* Modified FPaths::IsRelative to be more consistent with expectations and correct. No more prepending a slash just to make a path relative!
* New: Performance: Cast flags can now be declared for non-intrinsic classes. Added cast flag support to a handful of the most commonly used classes in the engine.
	* AActor, USceneComponent, and some derived classes have been added. See "Casts.h" for more information.
* PRAGMA_(ENABLE/DISABLE)_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS unified across all platforms.
* New: Renamed ClampSize and SafeNormal vector functions to make their use clearer
* The invariant culture for internationalization is now "en-US-POSIX" (English, United States, POSIX standard).
* There are two new .ini locations of note.
	* One is in your /AppData (or ~Library/Application Support on Mac) directory, called Epic/Unreal Engine/Engine/Config/User*.ini.
	* The other is in your project dierctory, Config/User*.ini.
	* If either or both of these exist, these are applied in that order AFTER all other .ini files.
	* This is currently being used for saving Android SDK directory locations in the Android SDK section of the Project Settings. However, you may want to make use of them yourself.
* New: BINARY: Unreal Build Tool will now use IncrediBuild (if available) when compiling game projects in the binary-only release
* The UnrealBuildTool setting to force unity build will now take precedence over the setting to try and compile faster without using unity files so that it's actually possible to force a unity build on all modules.
* New: UnrealHeaderTool will no longer automatically generate declarations for functions that the user has to manually implement (GetLifetimeReplicatedProps, all functions with _Implementation and _Validate suffixes).
* UObject::GetArchetype when called on construction script created components will now find the component from the SimpleConstructionScript to reference as its Archetype, rather than using the class default object for the component class.
* UObject::Modify has been prevented from doing anything during garbage collection.
* struct/class mismatch in generated code fixed.
	* FInterval has been deprecated and should be replaced with FFloatInterval.
* UnrealHeaderTool: Improved default-value parsing for things like FText::FromString, and corrected some places where it was treating C++ types as case-insensitive

#### Editor and Tools
* New: Add accessor GetModeTools() to FEditorViewportClient
* New: Added calls to PostEditMove when dragging an actor into the world.
* New: Added -List option to UnrealPak to list all files in a PAK file with stored size.
* New:  Added additional checks in the New Class dialog to disallow creating classes whose generated headers would clash with existing engine headers.
	* This should prevent users creating new code classes through the editor which would break the build, e.g. a class named Platform (which would class with the engine header Platform.h).
* New: Added UEditorEngine::ReplaceActors that allows a list of specified Actors to be replaced, not just those that are currently selected.
* New: After adding a C++ Class using the editor, the code editing IDE will be opened automatically (we no longer prompt)
* Fixed a failed C++ Hot Reload displaying a success notification in the editor
* New: Improved warning message for properties with bogus clamp ranges to include the property name
* Move some selection set references in mode tools to use the 'local' selection set (may still be the global one, depending on the instance)
* New: Push stat display/toggle functionality up from SLevelViewport/FLevelEditorViewportClient to SEditorViewport/FEditorViewportClient, so it can be used in asset editors as well

#### Gameplay Framework
* New: New starter C++ source files when adding new classes to your project
	* When creating new Actor or ActorComponent classes through the editor, you'll now get a nice example source to start with
	* The example source includes a constructor with useful defaults, a BeginPlay() and Tick() function
* New: Added UWorld::GetNumPawns() to return the number of pawns in the world without having to loop through the pawn iterator.
* New: AActor::GetComponents() can now support TArrays with different allocator types.
	* It is now recommended to use TArrays with a TInlineAllocator to potentially avoid memory allocation costs.
	* TInlineComponentArray is defined to make this easier.
* New: Moved WebBrowser and CEF3Utils projects to Runtime folder so that they can be used in games
* New: Optimized TimerManager performance when using TimerHandles.
* New: Plugins can put pak files into PluginName/Content/Paks/, which will be mounted automatically in cooked builds
* New: Add optional Thickness and DepthBias parameters to DrawOrientedWireBox
* New: Added build option to avoid building Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) libraries
* New: Added FBoxSphereBounds::SpheresIntersect() and FBoxSphereBounds::BoxesIntersect() to test for intersection/overlap between two bounds.
* New: Added FSphere::Intersects() to test for intersection between two spheres, with an optional tolerance.
* New: Added new methods to UPrimitiveComponent API
	* Added UPrimitiveComponent::ComponentIsTouchingSelectionBox and UPrimitiveComponent::ComponentIsTouchingSelectionFrustum, used by the editor to determine whether the selection box (in ortho or perspective viewports respectively) is overlapping with the component.
* New: Added reference bone pose overrides to FSkeletalMeshMerge.
	* An optional array of FRefPoseOverride structs can be passed to DoMerge().
	* This allows the merged reference skeleton to be composited from different source meshes independent of the order of the source meshes.
* New: Added XML Parser function for anonymous discovery of XML node attributes (FXmlNode::GetAttributes)
* New: Converted Engine and Sample projects to use Timer Handles instead of delegate based timer referencing.
* New: CharacterMovement networking tweaks for bandwidth and accuracy.
	* Acceleration is rounded to the 1st decimal place in network games for more client/server consistency and less bandwidth usage. Exposed through RoundAcceleration() function.
	* CanCombineMove(): angle between acceleration vectors is tunable (and lowered from 8 to 5 degrees).
	* Custom classes can decide to avoid delaying a move if CanDelaySendingMove() returns false.
* New: Made the following GameNetworkManager functions virtual: WithinUpdateDelayBounds(), ExceedsAllowablePositionError(), New: Added ToMatchingText() function to GameplayTagContainer for consistency and ease of use by various other classes that need to represent comparisons of GameplayTags in the Editor in translated text.
* AActor::SerializedComponents has been renamed to BlueprintCreatedComponents
* AActor::SetActorTickEnabled is no longer a virtual function
* ActorComponents no longer must be active to keep their primary tick function enabled
* Added a debug version of the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) DLL wrapper library to avoid problems when using debug C Runtime Library (CRT)
* Avoid registering PhysicsVolumeChanged events for movement components when the UpdatedComponent is pending kill. Also avoid registering for overlap events in CharacterMovementComponent when UpdatedComponent is pending kill.
	* Fixes ensure triggered under these (rare) conditions.
* Avoid using a potentially invalid faceIndex when retrieving the physical material from landscape collision data.
* Changed Pawn::PostNetReceiveLocationAndRotation() to use SetActorLocationAndRotation() rather than TeleportTo(), for efficiency.
* CharacterMovementComponent helper functions SafeNormalPrecise() and ClampMaxSizePrecise() renamed with "Get" prepended to indicate that they don't mutate but return a value instead.
* Definition of FTimerDynamicDelegate has been moved from TimerManager.h to EngineTypes.h to allow FBlueprintTimerDynamicDelegate to be removed and FTimerDynamicDelegate used directly instead.
* Don't assert in UCharacterMovementComponent::CapsuleTouched() if bEnablePhysicsInteraction is disabled, since it can be changed dynamically after the function is registered. Also don't gate removal of the delegate on this variable for the same reason.
* Changed EGameplayContainerMatchType from a namespace enum to an enum class. Removed all TEnumAsByte<> and ::Type parts from variables and parameters using the enum.
* Marked the proxy mesh created by camera components as NotForClient and NotForServer, as it isn't constructed in non-editor builds and is already invisible in-game
* When changing levels using seamless travel, objects in old sub-levels will now also be marked pending kill.
* When destroying components that create visualizer components, ensure the visualizer component is also destroyed.
* GameMode.h has been removed from EnginePrivate.h
* Fixed mismatches between WITH_EDITORONLY_DATA and WITH_EDITOR usage in UCameraComponent
* Fixed a case where a non-normalized normal can get through collision result handling. Renamed 'TraceDir' and 'Direction' variables to be more explicit that they are not actually normalized.
* Fixed CharacterMovementComponent::CalcVelocity() not actually clamping acceleration result of ApplyRequestedMove().
	* Was only an issue if someone had overridden ApplyRequestedMove() and not clamped it internally, since the engine's version still did.
* Fixed possibility of hanging on to stale references to UpdatedComponent in MovementComponent.
	* Pending kill objects are now not allowed to be used by SetUpdatedComponent().
	* MovementComponent::TickComponent() now nulls out UpdatedComponent if it is pending kill.
* NetworkVelocityNearZero().
* Made FComponentInstanceDataBase::MatchesComponent non-virtual
* Marked CharacterMovementComponent::PhysicsVolumeChanged() as an override.
* Moved stat counter for UpdateOverlaps() to the "Game" group from "Quick", and added stat counter for UpdatePhysicsVolume().
* Moved SWebBrowser into the WebBrowser module to reduce the amount of modules/projects that will include it automatically
* MovementComponent and ProjectileMovementComponent auto-registration moved back to InitializeComponent to avoid registration order issues.
* Networked simulated proxies now check the replicated server state when testing if a component had failed to resolve on client.
	* Previously it was checking the local version which could be incorrect on the client.
* Optimized TArray::RemoveAt() and TArray::RemoveAtSwap() to only call CalculateSlack if they are allowed to shrink the array.
* Optimized UpdatePhysicsVolume() performance using a new list of all PhysicsVolumes stored per game world.
	* 3 ms saving in test scene with many characters that have overlap events disabled (because usually we use those overlaps to do the physics volume tests).
* Performance: Changed a few GetComponent() calls in critical paths to use the direct access instead of the array copy.
	* This is only possible where it's known that the components will not change ownership or be destroyed.
* PlayerController SetPause is back to its original implementation. Pausing networked games will work as originally intended again.
* Removed dummy StaticMeshComponent that was created by WorldSettings, that was used for character networking movement on BSPs before networking was switched to use component references.
* Replaced some color literals with FColor / FColorList entries
* Sockets that are children of FSkeletalMeshMerge bone overrides now also get overridden.
* ULocalPlayer::ControllerId made private
* UPrimitiveComponent::UpdateOverlaps() optimizations:
	* Avoids attempting any determination of old versus new overlaps if there are no current overlaps.
	* Avoids dynamic array allocation when determining old and new overlaps (RemoveSingleSwap changed to avoid shrinking array).
	* Uses TInlineAllocator presized a small amount to avoid dynamic allocation in cases with few overlaps.
* EditReregisterContexts in UActorComponent is now properly handled when PostEditChangeChainProperty is invoked.
* Instance and BlueprintCreated components arrays are now being cleaned up correctly when removing elements from OwnedComponents array
* OnComponentCreated is now called for components after copy/pasting an Actor or the component is Duplicated
* Fixed typo in description of ToggleFPS command
* Fixed a performance problem in SSafeZone on Windows platforms.
* Fixed CharacterMovementComponent never accepting a new UpdatedComponent if it was set during movement and movement mode was "None".
* Fixed TimerManager bugs when using Timer Handles.

#### Landscape
* New: Added "RemoveLandscapeXYOffsets" console command to completely remove any XY offset data and restore the landscape to pure heightfield.
* Fixed "FBodyInstance::UpdateBodyScale NegX does not exist" warning

#### Networking
* We have greatly simplified how clients connect to servers, but we also allow you to override this functionality to suit your needs.
	* Out of the box, we use a combination of the engine version, project name, and project version string to compute a single checksum that is then used by the client and server to verify they are compatible.
	* If you want to override this functionality, we offer two new delegates in FNetworkVersion. GetLocalNetworkVersionOverride will allow you to override the version that is sent to the server, and IsNetworkCompatibleOverride will allow you to override the comparison used to see if the server and client are compatible.
* New: Added the ability for game code to get demo recording and playback failures
* New: Added the ability to get the demo playback position from game code, and added a demo playback timeline bar to ShooterGame to showcase this
* New: Added the ability to record demos when loading a map with the "DemoRec=" URL option
* New: When travel failure of type ETravelFailure::PackageMissing is invoked, the error string is now the redirect URL that was obtained from the server. This is the address the client can use to download the missing map.
* New: Improved the verbosity of logs on various important networking issues
* New: Added IOnlineFriends::QueryRecentPlayers, which gives you access to players you've recently encountered (which you may or may not be friends with)
* We removed some unused networking properties from the Actor base class
* We have lowered the verbosity on various benign network warnings
* APlayerState::UpdatePing, APlayerState::RecalculateAvgPing and APlayerController::UpdatePing are now virtual functions so they can be overloaded
* Removed obsolete seamless travel feature on AGameSession
* Added some missing const qualifiers to networking functions that are logically const:
	* AActor::IsNetRelevantFor, UNetDriver::IsLevelInitializedForActor, UNetConnection::ClientHasInitializedLevelFor, and FNetGuidCache::SupportsObject
* Exposed the UOnlineSession class variable on the ULocalPlayer to be able to access online features.
* Fixed an issue where a local listen server host wasn't able to pass the same "user options" on the login URL as clients were. Now all players do the same work.
* Reset name of last loaded client package mapname when server travelling between the same map. It is possible that the server can get to PostSeamlessTravel before the client has and it will think that the client is already there when it isn't.
* The world net driver should now properly return that it is a client for the duration of the tick in which it would have been destroyed in preparation for server travel. Previously GetNetMode() would return that it was a server for the remainder of the tick with undefined behavior.

#### Online
* The logging category 'LogHttp' is now visible to anyone who includes http.h.
* Fixed a rare crash when searching for sessions using the Null online subsystem.
* A couple enumeration values in EOnJoinSessionCompleteResult have been renamed to be more consistent with the rest of the session code.
* Fixed a GetLastError call being too late to be helpful in the HTTP WinInet implementation
* Fix for shutdown issue in BuildPatchServices
* Fixed an issue where online subsystem modules were not being unloaded in the reverse order in which they were loaded relative to other modules.
	* This ensures safety while unloading modules in case there is a dependency between an online subsystem module and another module.
* Some of the online subsystem classes were not destroying their interface objects in the reverse order in which they were constructed. These cases have been fixed.
	* This ensures safety in the case where one interface object holds a pointer or reference to another interface of the same online subsystem.

#### Paper2D
* New: Added a ContainsSprite method to UPaperFlipbook, indicating if a specific sprite asset is being used by the flipbook asset
* New: Added a method to determine if a tile map render component is instanced or referencing an asset (UPaperTileMapRenderComponent::OwnsTileMap)
* New: Added FPaperTileInfo::IsValid to determine if a single tile is valid or not
* New: Renamed UPaperTileMapRenderComponent to UPaperTileMapComponent
* New: Added DLL export to various actor classes, allowing them to be derived from in other modules
* Changed the default value for UPaperTileMap::SeparationPerLayer to 4 (from 64)
* Changed UPaperTileLayer::ResizeMap to avoid doing unnecessary work if the size didn't change
* Optimized UPaperTileMap::PostEditChangeProperty to only reregister components actually using this particular tile map
* Prevented a rare crash at startup by moving SmartSnapping module to load post-engine-init, preventing it from loading the level editor module at pre-init

#### Physics
* New: Add new API to do collision traces using a Collision Profile instead of a trace channel and response params.
	* The UWorld trace functions are the same except they end with "ByProfile" (ex. SweepSingleByProfile).
	* There is a BlueprintType structure called 'CollisionProfileName' that can be used to specify collision profiles in blueprints. It uses the collision profiles setup for your project and creates a custom combo box.

![](PanelWidget.png)

* There is also a graph pin widget that supports expose on spawn.

![](PinWidget.png)

* New: Added ENGINE_API to UTireType class to allow subclassing in C++ outside the Engine module.
* Added some utility functions that are useful when working with collision profiles, channels, and responses.
	* Added function 'UCollisionProfile::GetChannelAndResponseParams'. It returns the collision channel and the response params from a collision profile.
	* Added function 'FCollisionResponseContainer::ReplaceChannels()'. It will replace response channels that match a specific response with another response.
	* Added function 'FBodyInstance::ReplaceResponseToChannels()'. It will replace the body's response channels that match a specific response with another response.
* Optimized Vehicle UpdateDrag function to do nothing when vehicle is not moving.
* Remove triangles with very small area when cooking collision trimesh (BSP) data (area is controlled by physics settings "TriangleMeshTriangleMinAreaThreshold").
	* Fixes various issues caused by having degenerate triangles in PhysX trimesh collision data.
	* Geometry must be cooked for this to have an effect. Cooked physics data version has been bumped to force geometry rebuild.
* Setting scale when updating an instance transform on an instanced mesh component now correctly updates the physics state for the instance.
* Updated the WheeledVehicleMovementComponent class to allow for game-side inheritance.
* Fixed the results of OverlapMulti queries so that the overlapping object is not returned as overlapping itself.
* Fixed convex mesh not yielding useful penetration distances for "zero distance" hits (hits right next to something).
	* Fallback is now simulated for convex meshes (since we can't inflate them) by trying a distance pushed in the direction of trace, or back away from that direction, and then in axial directions (only against the shape the hit was reported for).
* Fixed BSP collision issues with initial overlaps (distance = 0 or less) when minimum translation direction fails.
	* The previous fallback of FindOverlappedTriangleNormal() could return no triangles when exactly against the point of contact, so if that test fails then use a slightly inflated query geometry.

#### Platforms
* New: When a GitHub/Perforce user attempts to Package a Content Only game without the relevant UE4 binary, they are notified, with details, during the packaging.

###### Android
* New: Message boxes are now displayed when appropriate when user input is required. Programmers can use the FMessageDialog interface to show them.
* We now enforce separate APKs if multiple CPU or GPU types are selected in the Android project settings, which causes the .apk to have -es2 (or -es31) in the filename.
* Added debug logging for screen resolution selection
* Cleaned up some of the Java Native Interface code for Android.
* Added a timeout for GooglePlay Game login wait and corrected missing forwarding of onActivityResult to GPG
* Cleaned up Android shader overrides and disabled caching after failed shader compiles so overrides are actually tested
* GL_OES_standard_derivatives extension is now detected for ES2 and works around missing dFdx, dFdy, fwidth functions by patching shader for Android. Be aware this does not properly implement these functions, but provides a workaround for some cases like distance-field fonts.
* Disabled OS crash handler on Android (getting better stack traces from system logcat for now.) May be enabled by uncommenting FPlatformMisc::SetCrashHandler(EngineCrashHandler) in JNI_OnLoad in AndroidJNI.cpp.
* Touch events no longer call GetScreenRect before OpenGL initialized. This would cause initialization from the event thread leading to later crashes
* Now caches FAndroidWindow::GetScreenRect results for performance.

###### iOS
* Changed default render target handling to Load/Store instead of NoAction (fixes some rendering errors at minor speed cost)
* Replaced an incorrect int32 usage in iOS which was causing issues in arm64 build.
* Fixed an error that could cause the compiler to fail to find header files in third-party frameworks when compiling plugins for iOS.
* Fixed usage of the deprecated handleOpenURL method in the iOS app delegate, it now implements openURL instead.

###### Mac
* New: Added size constraints for windows on Mac
* New: BINARY: Added handling of negative UBT exit codes to Mac RocketBuild.sh
* New: Disabled warning about unsupported OpenGL debug output extensions
* New: Added support for DrawIndirect rendering when the GL_ARB_draw_indirect extension is present.
* New: Mac now checks for the 'UE4_FORCE_MALLOC_ANSI' environment variable to use FMallocAnsi for memory allocation. This is required when attaching Apple's 'OpenGL Profiler' or it will crash.
* Disabled the call stack symbolisation on Mac OS X in everything but Crash Report Client & other helper programs to avoid a crash in Apple's code.
* Simplified dylib search paths with wider use of RPATHs
* The meaning of control and command keys are no longer swapped at the Platform level on Mac.
* Increased the default thread stack size on Mac to 2 MB
* Fixed a crash in MacToolChain caused by empty custom resource path
* Fixed a problem with Server targets missing from Xcode project
* Fixed linking with debug version of ICU libraries
* Fixed setting of rpaths on Mac when building remotely from PC
* Fixed syncing Git dependencies on non-Unix drives.
* Fixed a potential crash bug by using a static function to access SmallLayoutFont.
	* Were this value to be constructed before the UObject system was initialised it would trigger an assert, which can happen on Mac OS X depending on module load order.
	* Using a static function ensures that the value is only constructed when first needed which will always be after the UObject system is initialised.
* Fixed the incorrect usage of GL_UNPACK_CLIENT_STORAGE_APPLE that was causing texture creation to fail on Mac OS X, notably affecting the precomputed atmospheric fog texture data.
* Fixed UnrealBuildTool crash when launched with Mono 3.12.0
* Fixed using ApiTrace to record Unreal's OpenGL usage under Mac OS X by disabling the GL_APPLE_texture_range and GL_APPLE_client_storage extensions that ApiTrace doesn't implement correctly.
* From Mac OS X 10.10.1 onward we no longer need to flush OpenGL after creating a texture, which improves performance.
	* Add code to flush OpenGL before resuming the render thread after suspending it to ensure that we correctly share resources across OpenGL contexts.
* On Mac OS X 10.10.1 and upward use glBufferSubData with Multi-Threaded OpenGL as it works in Unreal from this release of Mac OS X.
* Prevent crashes on Mac OS X when using Apple's Multi-Threaded OpenGL option (the default).
	* Fixed FOpenGL3::MapBufferRange to use the proper flags for the RLM_Write mapping type.
	* Added FOpenGL3::BufferSubData which is used in place of glBufferSubData so that on Mac OS X we can avoid calling glBufferSubData to prevent an MTGL synchronisation bug.

###### Linux
* New: Added a plugin for interoperability with KDevelop when browsing/editing sources - experimental.
* New: Added case-insensitive reading of files independent from the file system (the engine will try to map a missing filename to one of existing files) - experimental.
* New: QMake project generator added to UBT.
* New: Switched to SDL text input API for handling input.
* New: UBT will now look for names of co-installable clang versions if clang++ cannot be found in $PATH.
* Unsuppressed many warnings - this can make Linux projects created with previous versions cease to build.
* Fixed a name collision between OpenGL functions and engine symbols.
* Compiling mono projects should no longer fail due to incorrect tool version (provided that an up to date mono supporting tools version 4.0 is used).
* GitDependencies.exe will now be restarted in case of mono crash.
* Fixed Linux not using SIMD math on x86-64 (mistakenly disabled when adding Linux ARM support in 4.6).
* Fixed Vehicle and Vehicle Advanced template code projects so they can be compiled on a case-sensitive file system.

###### Playstation 4
* New: Added function level optimization control. Use DISABLE_FUNCTION_OPTIMIZATION when declaring a function, eg: DISABLE_FUNCTION_OPTIMIZATION void TestFunc();
* New: Added LCUE to the UE4 codebase to allow future modifications and toggling of asserts and validations
* New: Added support for clearing the CMASK of a kRenderTargetFormat8 render target

* PS4's thread affinity interface is now fully implemented.

###### Xbox One
* New: Added a new Xbox One occlusion query system that uses the WriteQuery API which is more robust with parallel rendering.
* Xbox One builds now require the November 2014 QFE1 XDK.
* Fixed Xbox One package name utility to be called with the full engine path, which clears up build issues with particular pathing setups.
* Fixed OVERRIDE macro compilation warnings in Xbox One code.
* New: Xbox One debug symbols are now processed and cached for the runtime. This will enable future runtime debug improvements.

#### VR
* Updated the Oculus SDK to 0.4.4.
* Updated the Oculus Mobile SDK to 0.4.2.

#### Rendering
* New: Extended functions for debug drawing (API from SceneManagement.h file). It's useful for debug rendering.
	* Added "Thickness" parameter to some functions for wired shapes rendering. It's set to 0 by default.
	* Added GetHalfSphereMesh, GetConeMesh and GetCapsuleMesh functions.
* New: The "r.FullScreenMode" console variable has been updated to be more clear as to it's purpose
	* The value "2" (windowed at native resolution) has been removed as it was just a special case of "1" windowed
	* The engine now always obeys the requested resolution (from "r.setres") when in windowed mode
* New: Added r.SkySpecularOcclusionStrength to tweak Distance Field Ambient Occlusion influence on sky specular
* New: Changed parent class of SplineComponent from SceneComponent to PrimitiveComponent so that subclasses can add rendering functionality.
* New: Export Decal Component for sub classing
* New: Removed InstanceInverseTransform matrix from the InstancedStaticMesh per-instance render data, saving significant memory. This matrix was never used by the rendering code.
* Fixed OpenGL rendering after switching the shaders to use SV_Position wherever possible.
	* In the shader compiler correct for OpenGL's gl_FragCoord.w value being different to SV_Position's.
* Replaced uses of glBufferSubData with FOpenGL::BufferSubData allowing platforms to override the implementation.
* Fixed a bug that caused materials drawn with DrawMaterial/DrawMaterialSimple on Canvas to be drawn upside-down on iOS and Android.
* Fixed an issue on Metal where SVPosition.w should contain the distance to the camera.
* Recompile Renderer Module now backs up and restores global shader map for all available feature levels.
* Added support for all operations in the Vector Virtual Machine. Currently most are not vectorized and so are slow. Added a vectorized implementation of Sin and Cos.
* Fixed dynamic directional shadows not showing on some mobile platforms
* Fixes a ref counting crash in resource binding when using parallel rendering.
* Light shaft render targets are now properly released when the light component is deregistered, this fixes a memory leak

#### UI
* New: Added support for custom notifications in Slate. With these, a notification can display arbitrary widget content.
	* See new FNotificationInfo constructors for examples
* Fixed incorrect tooltips on some menu items. Localizable text gathered from the UI_COMMAND macro now uses the namespace defined by LOCTEXT_NAMESPACE, where applicable, and nests that namespace under the UICommands namespace.
* Prevent log warnings about ranged numeric values if UIMin metadata is used without UIMax, as it is a valid case that constrains the slider widget on one end only

#### Slate
* New: Added optimization to SCanvas::OnPaint to avoid painting children that are fully clipped
* New: Improved the Slate atlas visualizers, and added a font atlas visualizer to let you view Slate font atlas pages
	* The font atlas visualizer can be opened via the Slate Widget Reflector, or via the "FontAtlasVisualizer" cheat.
	* The texture atlas visualizer can be opened via the Slate Widget Reflector, or via the "TextureAtlasVisualizer" cheat.
	* Added support for zooming and panning of the atlas pages, which helps greatly when viewing font atlases as they can be as large as 2048x2048.
* New: Added button to trigger atlas debug view to the Widget Reflector
* New: Slate's Core Style now includes a monospace font, which is useful for showing tabular data.
* New: Locking the cursor to a widget now keeps the locking region's bounds up to date even if the widget's geometry changes.
* New: Multiple SMenuAnchor improvements
	* SMenuAnchors now automatically figure out whether they should EPopupMethod::UserCurrentWindow or EPopupMethod::CreateNewWindow based on context.
	* The menus that utilize EPopupMethod::UseCurrentWindow will now properly respect the window boundaries and attempt to best fit within the window.
* New: Slate now supports radial hittesting. This feature is still in active development and the API is likely to change.
* New: Slate windows now support MinWidth, MinHeight, MaxWidth, MaxHeight.
* New: The Widget Reflector can now visualize Slate performance metrics.
* New: GetMousePositionScaledByDPI has been added, can convert raw mouse positions into the same space as widgets after being scaled by the current DPI scale value.
* New: Added STableRow::OnCanAcceptDrop and STableRow::OnAcceptDrop. Implementing these delegates provides out of the box visualization and handling of drag and dropping in lists, trees, and tile views.
* List view should not attempt to scroll if that would lead outside scroll range. This check is performed only if overscroll is not allowed.
* Added debug-only warnings for missing float and vector constants in a style to match how the other Get methods work
* Fixed the Slate Draw Prepass only being called on top-level windows (not their children).
* SBoxPanel's InsertSlots function defaults to AddSlot if no index is specified.
* SSearchBox can now be customized so that button can appear to the left of the text entry area.
* Slate resources of a slot are now released after removing the slot from a panel. This fixes bugs users were experiencing as a crash on exit after adding and removing multiple items a panel, either through drag/drop or other means.
* Slate Application now passes along motion detection events to fix a bug where focusing a Slate widget would stop motion input from being received by the game.
* Fixed Slate inline editable text boxes not correctly restoring keyboard focus when they are closed
* Fixed a bug where not having focus meant a viewport would not report it's desired cursor visualization correctly.
* Fixed an issue in which menus were always causing the parent widget to lose focus, even if not requested.
* Fixed an issue where some key input event didn't properly specify they were from a gamepad.
* Fixed the ScrollView Bar Style not being used even if set.
* SListView no longer emits a SelectionChanged event if the selection is cleared, but nothing was selected.
* Fixed a bug in the element batcher where images were still being treated as a box if they had a margin, instead of it properly ignoring the field. 
* After a drag-drop ends, we now properly reset the widgets under cursor in order to ensure MouseEnter events are resent.

#### Sample Games
* Fixed crash in UStrategyAIAction_AttackTarget::MoveCloser
* Fixed spacebase not applying thrust in C++ Flying template.
* StrategyGame: Removed an unneeded call to PlayMovie()
	* PlayMovie() is called by FCoreUObjectDelegates::PreLoadMap.Broadcast() in UEngine::LoadMap()
* Fixed a potential crash in the Strategy Game sample
* ShooterGame sample: Revised several spawn functions
	* Revised IsSpawnpointPreferred to use the character default object to access the capsule data required to determine if a spawn point is usable.
	* Revised IsSpawnpointPreferred to return false if the player character object is not available
	* Revised IsSpawnpointAllowed to return false if it is given a null pointer as the spawn to check

#### UMG
* The UWidget and UWidgetTree now has a way to query the UWorld that they are currently part of, this fixes a crash in the MenuAnchor not having access to the current world when attempting to spawn a popup.
* The Widget Component in C++ is now a fully exported symbol from the UMG module DLL.
* UserWidgets now follow their outer chain looking for an outer that know what world they are in. This is necessary if you want to know what world a widget is in for player controller queries...etc from a nested UUserWidget that's defined statically.
* Added safer handling for the case when a user explicitly attempts to destroy a UUserWidget. It can now force the removal of the widget reference from the SObjectWidget, or the parent UMG Widget.
* Fixed a crash when FUMGEditorModule::PostCompile is called 2 times (without PreCompile)
* Fixed a crash that occurs in the UMG editor when trying to insert a new node into the graph and encountering null nodes.

## Upgrade Notes

#### Versioning
* The minimum engine version has been raised from version 108 to 214.
	* All content saved since April 2013 QA Build will still be loadable. All older content must be resaved before updating.
	* All backwards compatibility code for the removed versions has been removed, as have the deprecated properties, classes, functions, and all redirects that were in place as of P4 changelist #1563929.
	* More details in this forum thread:
[Old Sample Content in UE 4.7 [IMPORTANT]](https://forums.unrealengine.com/showthread.php?57455-Old-Sample-Content-in-UE-4-7-IMPORTANT)

#### Programming
* Visual Studio 2013 is now required to build the editor on Windows. Visual Studio 2012 format project files are still supported for platforms that require it, but building editor targets will always invoke the 2013 toolchain.

#### C++ API Breaking Changes
* ClampSize and SafeNormal functions have now been deprecated and will generate warnings if they are still in use.  You should now use GetClampedToSize and GetSafeNormal etc.
* Any titles that use Kinect will need to manually edit out the new sections in Deploy.appxmanifest.template and Package.appxmanifest.template for 4.7. This will be moved to project settings in a future release.
* Removed GPixelCenterOffset, GSupportsVertexInstancing, GSupportsEmulatedVertexInstancing, GVertexElementsCanShareStreamOffset, and GSupportsVertexTextureFetch variables.
* Removed FAudioDevice::SetClassVolume.
* Property editor APIs that used to get or set using an FString for the property display name, filter string, or tool tip, now use FText instead. This will most likely affect any detail customizations you may have.
* AActor::SetActorTickEnabled is no longer a virtual function
* Direct uses of ULocalPlayer::ControllerId need to be changed to use GetControllerId()
* The constructor signature for FEditorViewportClient has changed, so custom editors with subclasses of FEditorViewportClient will need to be updated to pass nullptr in as the first argument of the parent constructor (FEditorModeTools* InModeTools)
* Removed UNavigationComponent. 
* Material instances using base property overrides now correctly inherit their parent's overrides rather than always using the base material's settings. If you were relying on the old behavior you will need to update the overrides on some materials.
* Minor modifications to IHeadMountedDisplayInterface, which will need to be updated on other implementations of HMD devices if they want to take advantage of the extended functionality
* INavAgentInterface::GetNavAgentProperties changed the return type so if you have overridden it you'll need to update your code.
* If you created custom blackboard key observers you'll need to update your code. The compiler will generate warnings for you.
* If you've implemented your own Behavior Tree nodes in C++ you may need to update their overrides of parent functions.
* As part of the AIController::GetFocalPointOnActor change,  FFocusKnowledge::FFocusItem has been removed and replaced with regular FVector.
* AAIController::UseBlackboard has been unvirtualized. Override AAIController::InitializeBlackboard for once-per-blackboard-asset initialization.
* If you override AActor::IsNetRelevantFor or UNetConnection::ClientHasInitializedLevelFor in your code, you will need to add const qualifiers to your function signatures.
* A couple enumeration values in EOnJoinSessionCompleteResult have been renamed to be more consistent with the rest of the session code:
	* EOnJoinSessionCompleteResult::RoomIsFull has been renamed to EOnJoinSessionCompleteResult::SessionIsFull
	* EOnJoinSessionCompleteResult::RoomDoesNotExist has been renamed to EOnJoinSessionCompleteResult::SessionDoesNotExist
* GetDynamicMeshElements path on scene proxies is enabled by default
	* PreRenderView / DrawDynamicElements are no longer used and have been removed
* CharacterMovementComponent networking functions have had their acceleration parameter types changed from FVector_NetQuantize100 to FVector_NetQuantize10.
* EGameplayContainerMatchType has been converted from namespace enum to enum class so instead of EGameplayContainerMatchType::Type, you should directly use EGameplayContainerMatchType.
* Any scripts which invoke buildpatchtool.exe using the -touchonly switch should be altered to call it with -nopatchdelete instead
* FLevelEditorViewportClient::ComponentIsTouchingSelectionBox was removed, as was FDragTool_ActorFrustumSelect::IntersectsVertices. Code which handled specific component types in these methods should be moved to the appropriate UPrimitiveComponent interface method in the component itself.
* IContentBrowserSingleton::CreateOpenAssetDialog and CreateSaveAssetDialog now take a second delegate parameter: OnDialogCancelled.
* UpdateLevelStreaming and FlushLevelStreaming no longer require view information
* FAsyncPackage::GetPackageName() now returns an FName instead of an FString. In some situations may break existingcode.
* USkeletalMeshComponent::UpdateKinematicBonesToPhysics now takes a reference parameter to the set of bones to update.
	* USkinnedMeshComponent::SpaceBases public transform array has been removed, replaced with a private SpaceBasesArray and accessor functions GetSpaceBases() and GetEditableSpaceBases()
* Added a new pure virtual to IAssetEditorInstance; InvokeTab()
* Added a number of new pure virtual functions to the source control API:
	* Added new pure virtual ISourceControlState::FindHistoryRevision(const FString&)
	* Added new pure virtual ISourceControlRevision::GetRevision()
	* Added new pure virtual ISourceControlProvider::UsesChangelists()
* Any classes that inherit from ScriptComponent need to be updated to inherit from ScriptPluginComponent instead.
* Delegates are no longer comparable with operator==. All delegates are now created with an FDelegateHandle, which can be retrieved with GetHandle().
	* Multicast delegate .Add* functions now return a handle, and removed by .Remove(FDelegateHandle).  RemoveAll is still allowed.
	* Any system which was reliant on delegate identity has been replaced with a handle-based system, e.g. timers, tickers, etc.  Any such usage should be replaced with the functions mentioned in the deprecation warning.
* The return value of MovementComponent::UpdatedComponent has changed from UPrimitiveComponent* to USceneComponent*.
* Added an early-out to AttachTo() for the case where a component was attaching with the same parameters as it is currently attached with
	* If you rely on the behaviour that calling AttachTo() with identical params would cause a detach and reattach, you will now need to explicitly detach first
* FCoreUObjectDelegates::OnObjectModified is now called only once per frame for each unique object that has Modify() called on it.
* SListView can no longer be instantiated on non-UObject pointer types; this has never been valid use of SListView, but was previously only enforced by way of documentation.
* Adjusted the descriptions for Macros and Functions as well as added a section on Calling Functions.
* Added a radius parameter to FHittestGrid::GetBubblePath for virtual cursors. This allows us to have cursors larger than a single point.  You can leave it set to 0 if you do not require this behavior.
* Rename MeshComponent::Materials to OverrideMaterials to more accurately describe their role as a per-instance override
	* Accordingly GetNumOverrideMaterials now returns number of overridden materials.
* Exposed the owning mode tools on FEdMode as GetModeManager() and refactored GetWorld() code into a virtual on the mode tools (overridden in FAssetEditorModeTools to pull from the asset editor scene where possible)
* Standalone asset editors can now host their own mode tools instance, allowing reuse of editor modes and associated machinery outside of the level editor
	* This feature is still a work in progress, as many pieces of state such as the selection set and path to the world instance are still typically accessed via globals like GEditor, but there is a proof-of-concept implementation in the standalone tile map editor in Paper2D
	* Most ModeTools interaction and support has been moved into FEditorViewportClient from the level editor
* UEditorEngine::ReplaceSelectedActors no longer takes unused parameter NewActorClass
* Remove some ancient references to RF_EdSelected and some unused selection methods
* Replace some GLevelEditorModeTools() uses with ModeTools in editor viewport client subclasses
* Split out FEdMode and FEditorModeTools into separate files
* Split graph connection drawing policies out into individual files and moved ConnectionDrawingPolicy.h to a public folder, as it was already being used externally
* Added DLL export to FWidget::SetUsesEditorModeTools, allowing it to be used in other modules
* Some classes which are mirrored as UStructs, like FTransform, FMatrix, FVector etc. are now defined as structs instead of classes. Any forward declarations of these types will need to be changed from 'class' to 'struct'.
	* Some typedefs, like FFloatInterval, FInterpCurveFloat, FDateRange, etc. are now structs and may cause type deduction errors when used as TInterval etc. and should be updated if necessary, on a case-by-case basis.
* The default visibility of the transform gizmo, when no editor mode tools are registered with it, is true (visible). If you do not wish to display the widget in a custom viewport, you should call SetDefaultVisibility(false) on the viewport client's FWidget.

#### Animation
* Old branching points are now automatically converted to custom Anim Notifies.
* If you used previous "adding looping interpolation", you'll have to undo that change and apply this change.
* Double buffering is now on by default for all instances of Skinned Mesh Component. It can be turned off by calling SetSpaceBaseDoubleBuffering(false). Any custom derived classes that do use double buffering and do their own bone updating will need to call FlipEditableSpaceBases. USkeletalMeshComponent or UPosableMeshComponent can be used as examples.

#### Blueprints
* If you are carefully managing which Blueprints are allowed to tick (e.g. for dedicated server performance), you will probably want to set Can Blueprints Tick By Default to false for your project and explicitly opt in for ticking via ChildCanTick on specific cosmetic classes.
* Blueprints that contain Add Component nodes for non-Scene Component subclasses no longer need to specify a Transform, but existing nodes that have connections will be left intact with the pins visible.
* We now user preference for legacy menuing system to be cleared. If you want to continue using the legacy Blueprint Editor context menu you will need to reselect it in the Editor Preferences. The Blueprints team would also love to hear about why you can't switch to the new system!
* Some Actor functions have become 'pure', which means they no longer have 'execution' inputs and outputs. Blueprints should be fixed up automatically.
* Blueprints searching functionality was moved to use the asset registry. To fully utilize this functionality, Blueprints are required to be resaved. The old Derived Data Cache (DDC) data will still be used, if available, for searching.
* If you are using the FText AsDate node in any blueprints, confirm that the output still fits expectations.
* If there happens to already be an implemented const function in a Blueprint that was in place prior to this change, the compiler will allow it to pass as an event. However, deleting the event and re-implementing the override will open as a function graph with a read-only 'self' context. For example, if you have a function declared in C++ like this:

	UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent)
	int32 MyFunctionThatReturnsSomeValue() const;

* If you implement that BlueprintImplementableEvent (BPIE) function in a Blueprint, it will now be flagged as 'const'. This makes any properties of 'self' read-only within the context of that graph, which means the compiler will emit an error if you try to set a property or otherwise call a non-const, non-static function with 'self' as the target.

* If there happens to already be an implemented const function in a Blueprint that was in place prior to this change, the compiler will emit a warning instead of an error, in order to allow existing Blueprints that may currently be "violating" const within the context of a const BPIE function to still compile, while still alerting to issues that should probably be addressed.

#### Core
* Make sure to convert the result of FAsyncPackage::GetPackageName() to FString with ToString() method of an FName if code fails to compile as a result of this change.
* All instances of using operator new for creating new UObject-derived class instances should be replaced with NewObject or NewNamedObject.
* The syntax for FPropertyChangedEvent constructors has changed.  Replace calls to the three argument form of FPropertyChangedEvent with the one argument or two argument form

#### Gameplay Framework
* All SceneComponent subclasses that implement ApplyComponentInstanceData now must call Super::ApplyComponentInstanceData or else attachment to that type of component will not be maintained.
	* All SceneComponent's FComponentInstanceDataBase subclasses must be changed to subclass FSceneComponentInstanceData.
* Ensure that the WebBrowser and CEF3Utils folders have been removed from the Developer folder otherwise you may get a conflict with the new versions
* Some code that assumed a UPrimitiveComponent* type in MovementComponent will fail to compile. This should easily be fixed by using either the cached 'UpdatedPrimitive' or doing a manual cast in code that needs it.
* If you need the "Weapon" collision channel in your "UI" collision profile, please use Project Settings -> Collision to re-enable it.
* C++ references to UPaperTileMapRenderComponent will need to be updated to UPaperTileMapComponent to avoid a deprecation warning. Blueprint references will be automatically fixed up.
* FComponentInstanceDataBase subclasses that used MatchesComponent to not apply changes due to state changes should now do this filtering in the UActorComponent::ApplyComponentInstanceData override.

#### Physics
* If you would like to use the deprecated collision channels ECC_OverlapAllDynamic_Deprecated or ECC_OverlapAllStatic_Deprecated, please use FCollisionObjectQueryParams::AllDynamicObjects, FCollisionObjectQueryParams::AllStaticObjects.

#### Slate
* Input Pre-Processor and Analog Cursor support
	* Slate now supports an input pre processor.
		* Extend and implement IInputProcessor then register it FSlateApplication::SetInputPreProcessor()
	* FAnalogCursor is an implementation of a pre processor that allows for control of the cursor with the left game pad stick.
* Slate header files are no longer included in game projects automatically
	* If your game used Slate features in C++, please add #include "SlateCore.h" or #include "SlateBasics.h" to your game module source files
	* This change was made to greatly improve C++ rebuild times for projects that did not use Slate features directly
* Widgets that are not drawn will no longer be ticked. Widgets that are visually clipped, collapsed, or have 0-size will no longer be ticked.
* Prevented paint and tick methods from being called while GIsRoutingPostLoad is true. This can occur in editor builds when uncooked data needs to be streamed in. When this is occurring, slate can tick UMG blueprint code which is unsafe to call while loading.

#### Platforms
###### Android
* Changes you had made to AndroidManifest.xml or SigningConfig.xml will no longer be used. You will need to go into the Android section of Project Settings and enter your customizations there. If you had set "Package .pak in APK" you will need to set that as well in Project Settings.This is a one-time change for old projects. We have put some information on that screen to help with the transition.
* If you had added Java function calls to AndroidJNI.cpp, you will need to be careful when merging your changes.
* Known Issue: Due to a crash on some Lollipop 5.0.1 OpenGL drivers, we removed usage of ES 3.0 shaders on Android hardware supporting less than ES 3.1. The most visible side effect of this change may be seen on metallic materials (showing as **highly reflective**). Uncomment line 353 in AndroidOpenGL.cpp to return to previous behavior if you need this before a fix is ready in 4.7.1.
* To use a Gear VR, see the Oculus set up notes for installing your osig signature file in the .apk in order to run on device.

###### iOS
* Changes you have made to your Info.plist settings will no longer be used. You will need to go into the iOS section of Project Settings and make sure everything is set as desired. You may want to delete your Info.plist file when you are done to reduce confusion.

###### PS4
* Companion App support is longer enabled by default, and must be enabled through the PS4 section of the Project Settings.
* Users must clear their PS4's O: because the hashing algorithm on directory paths changed.

###### Xbox One
* While the title is running, logs can be accessed from the scratch partition with Windows Explorer by going to the path \\\RunningTitle\Drives\Scratch\Logs.
* Xbox One builds now require the November 2014 QFE1 XDK.

#### Rendering
* We plan to add occlusion culling to the hierarchical foliage management system. Until then you may see decreased performance in situations where the camera is indoors but a large amount of foliage is in the view frustum.

#### Other
* We no longer support slash for command line switches (e.g. "UE4Editor /SomeOption"); only dash switches (e.g. "UE4Editor -SomeOption") are supported. If you have any scripts or other tools that have been using slashes, change them to dashes.
* UnrealVS does not auto-update. The latest vsix must be executed to install the new version.

#### AI
* ReceiveConditionCheck has been changed to return a value (no longer requiring user to call FinishConditionCheck) which resulted in it no longer being possible to use it as a plain blueprint event. Now users will need to re-implement this even like a function (there's an option to generate this implementation in Blueprint UI). Blueprint editor may have an issue with creating ReceiveConditionCheck implementation while the old ReceiveConditionCheck event is in the event graph, so we recommend deleting all old ReceiveConditionCheck occurrences, saving all Blueprints, restarting the editor and implementing the new ReceiveConditionCheck. Sorry for the hassle!
* AIController class allows you to change how pathfinding requests are being created, executed and passed to path following. See following functions for more details: PreparePathfinding, RequestPathAndMove, RequestMove

#### Paper2D
* Any existing tile maps that relied on the default layer separation being 64 will need to be updated to set the Separation Per Layer property back to 64, as the default was changed to 4
