(#what'snew)

# 新内容

这个版本包含了许多新功能和大量性能优化。在我们准备发行下一款游戏Paragon时，性能一直是我们关注的焦点。4.11中包含了一些新的渲染和动画功能，主要是渲染真实的角色，还有一些新的音频功能和工具改进。UE4继续推动VR向前发展，改进了VR渲染，并支持最新的SDK，这样当VR硬件对消费者可用时，您就可以发布您的游戏了。

(#majorfeatures)

# 主要功能

(#performanceandmultithreading)

## 性能和多线程

在过去的几个月里，我们一直在努力优化UE4，以便让我们的下一款游戏Paragon能够在PC和PlayStation 4上以60fps的速度运行。

Paragon为团队提供了一系列独特的挑战。在Paragon中，我们需要支持一次性动画化10个英雄和120多个仆从，大量的特效，同时渲染一个美丽、详细的地图，以及60fps的长视线。Paragon将引擎推向极限，尤其是在动画和渲染方面。

![image alt text](image_0.png)(convert:false)

整个引擎中成千上万的小优化使得Paragon的性能有了很大的提高，并将使所有使用UE4构建的游戏受益。其中许多优化都在4.11中，将来的版本中还会有更多优化。下面是我们一直在进行的一些较大的优化。

 **并行化**。多核扩展对于在现代PC和主机上实现高帧率至关重要，因此，我们在几个方面改进了我们的 **线程架构**。我们降低了创建任务的成本，增加了对高优先级任务的支持，并删除了许多同步点。  

 **渲染性能**。渲染器现在可以更好地平衡工作任务的大小和为GPU生成的命令缓冲区，从而在不增加GPU开销的情况下实现最大的并行度。我们还努力删除渲染器中的同步点，以便更好地利用所有可用的内核。

 **服装模拟** 现在大大加快了速度，更好地利用了多线程。现在，我们直接从工作线程中调用每个资源的APEX解算器。这允许更好的调度，并消除了许多同步点和开销。服装现在将在动画后更新（当不需要混合时），否则在骨架网格体组件更新后更新。 

 **更快的垃圾回收**。现在，我们支持垃圾回收“群集”，它允许引擎将对象组视为一个单元，从而大大减少了需要考虑的对象数量。目前，只有用于材质和粒子系统的子对象是群集的。此外，标记和销毁阶段的缓存一致性更强，从而减少了9倍的时间，并在可达性分析期间减少了内存抖动。

 **多线程动画**。动画图形更新现在可以在工作线程上运行，允许动画角色的数量与内核的数量成比例。查看升级说明，因为我们已经弃用了许多与动画相关的API，而且动画图表在工作线程中运行有一些限制。

**即时动画变量访问**。我们在动画图表更新中为变量访问添加了一个“快速路径”。这允许我们简单地在内部复制参数，而不是执行蓝图代码。编译器目前可以优化以下结构：成员变量、否定布尔成员变量和嵌套结构的成员。

**附加动画“烘焙”**。我们现在有一个用于启用 **烘焙附加动画** 的选项。这可以将 **附加动画** 的使用速度加快 **3倍**。计算附加动画的差量姿势所涉及的工作是在烘焙时间而不是运行时完成的。这不仅节省了创建附加差量所涉及的计算工作，还节省了在运行时不再需要的基本动画解压所涉及的内存访问和分配。这个功能增加了烘焙时间，所以您需要通过将cvar“a.UseBakedAdditiveAnimations”设置为1来启用它。未来版本的引擎将重做动画烘焙，以避免这一成本，并永久启用此优化。

## 新内容：逼真的头发着色

基于最新的薄膜研究，我们添加了一个 **基于物理的逼真头发着色模型**。 

![image alt text](image_2.png)![image alt text](image_3.png)

它建立了两个高光叶，即透射和散射的模型。要使用此功能，只需从材质编辑器中的着色模型列表中选择 **头发（Hair）**。

(#new:)

## 新内容：逼真的眼睛着色

现在可以使用虚幻引擎新的基于物理的眼睛着色模型赋予您的人物 **高度逼真的眼睛**。

![image alt text](image_4.png)

着色模型近似于通过巩膜的次表面散射、虹膜上的焦散和湿层上的高光。与所提供的眼睛材质和眼球几何体一起使用。此外，这些效果一同模拟了通过角膜的折射，角膜缘环的变暗，并控制瞳孔的放大。

(#new:)

## 新内容：改进的皮肤着色

我们改进了逼真皮肤的次表面散射剖面 **着色模型** 的 **质量和性能**。

![image alt text](image_5.png)

更新后的着色模型以一半分辨率运行，需要的GPU内存更少。散射与分辨率无关，对象边缘不再有颜色偏移。通过以棋盘格模式分别存储漫反射和高光照明而非将两者打包到单个像素，纹理和照明细节得以更好地保存。

(#new:)

## 新内容：逼真的布料着色

我们添加了一个 **基于物理的布料着色模型****。这将模拟一个绒毛层，并将产生比以前更逼真的效果。要使用它，在材质编辑器中选择布料着色模型。

![image alt text](image_6.png)

## 新内容：胶囊体阴影

虚幻引擎现在支持由角色的 **胶囊体呈现** 投射的 **非常柔和的间接阴影**：

![image alt text](image_7.png)

通常情况下，当只是受到间接照明时，它们将不会有任何阴影，除了屏幕空间环境遮挡。间接阴影需要非常柔和，因为间接光照来自很多方向，所以传统的阴影贴图不是很好用。间接阴影方向和柔和度来自于全局光照在照明构建过程中放置和计算的体积照明样本。

在游戏中，间接的胶囊体阴影用于将角色置于环境中：

![image alt text](image_8.png)

您也可以使用胶囊体获取直接阴影。光源的半径或角度决定了它们的柔和度。这可以用来在一个有效的烘焙照明环境下实现非常柔和的角色阴影，这在以前是不可能的。

![image alt text](image_9.png)

这个胶囊体阴影实现是非常有效的，因为它使用深度感知上采样计算半分辨率的阴影，并使用屏幕图块剔除来将阴影限制用于需要它的地方。

GPU成本与胶囊体的数量和受投影影响的像素数量成正比。

如何启用胶囊体阴影

1. 仅使用长菱形体（胶囊体）创建一个新的物理资源。球体也可以，但不够灵活。胶囊体应在关节处略重叠。足部胶囊体是最需要调整的部分，以使角色看起来接地。通常不需要手臂，除非可以进入掩体或在地面上爬行。

2. 将物理资源分配到骨架网格体资源的阴影物理资源

3. 最后，在骨架网格体组件上启用胶囊提间接阴影

## 新内容：粒子景深

新的材质函数可以像渲染不透明的粒子一样，为景深扩展小的、离焦的粒子。

![image alt text](image_10.png)

左边的图像是一个简单的场景，许多粒子被放置在地面上。右边的图像启用了圆形景深，新的材质函数离焦渲染粒子，像所有其他几何体那样。质量甚至更好，因为它们不受噪点瑕疵的影响。为了避免闪烁，我们总是将离焦粒子扩展一个像素以上。

这个功能要求您对粒子材质进行更改：

![image alt text](image_11.png)

(#new:)

## 新内容：递色的不透明遮罩

您现在可以使用不透明材料通过递色的不透明遮罩 **模拟半透明表面**。

![image alt text](image_12.png)

材质编辑器中的“递色的不透明遮罩”复选框在启用时间抗锯齿时提供了一种与顺序无关的随机半透明形式。它利用时间抗锯齿将前景对象和背景混合在几帧上。这可以允许半透明对象使用我们所有的延迟着色特性，代价是一些噪点和重影。

(#new:)

## 新内容：递色的LOD交叉渐变

静态网格体现在可以使用动画递色模式 **平滑地在细节层级之间交叉渐变**！

![image alt text](image_13.gif)(convert:false)

注意：必须在材质上启用此功能，因为启用该功能需要的性能成本较小。

![image alt text](image_14.png)

(#new:)

## 新内容：改进的层级LOD

该版本对 **层级详细级别**(HLOD)系统进行了 **主要改进**。当详细网格体离得很远时，层级LOD可以自动地用一些简单的网格体替换大量的详细网格体。这将帮助您在近距离查看对象时获得更高的质量级别，并为您的关卡提供更快的整体性能。

![image alt text](image_15.png)

Paragon的 **Agora** -- 256万个三角形，5690个绘制调用（之前是394万个三角形，7060个绘制调用）

为了从HLOD中获得最大的好处，您需要Simplygon SDK（需要Simplygon许可证）。需要Simplygon以生成一个减少了多边形数量的代理网格体。没有它，系统将只烘焙使用不同材质的部分，并将它们组合到单一的绘图调用中。

还可以查看新的 **层级LOD大纲视图（Hierarchical LOD Outliner）** 功能，它有许多新设置，可以帮助您设置关卡的HLOD。

(#new:)

## 新内容：VR实例化立体渲染

实例化立体渲染是一种优化，可以使引擎更有效地渲染VR耳机的立体图像。 

以前，引擎通过为左眼绘制所有内容，然后为右眼绘制所有内容来渲染立体图像。通过实例化立体渲染，我们同时渲染两只眼睛，这大大减少了CPU的工作量，提高了GPU的效率。下面是并排运行的两种技术：

![image alt text](image_16.gif)(convert:false)

以动车作为我们的测试内容，我们看到CPU时间大约有14%的改进，GPU大约有7%的改进，且无工作需要！请注意，虽然大多数渲染功能都使用了立体实例化，但仍有少数功能不受支持（例如，DFAO）。

要在项目中启用此功能，请转到编辑器中的项目设置（Project Settings），并选中“实例化立体（Instanced Stereo）”框。

![image alt text](image_17.png)

(#new:)

## 新内容：动画动态（角色的快速物理模拟）

 **动画动态（Anim Dynamics）** 是一个用于动画蓝图的全新的 **自包含** 和 **简单物理模拟** 节点，允许动态运动通过程序添加到骨架网格体，而无需使用完整的物理解决方案：

![image alt text](image_18.gif)(convert:false)

下面是对动画动态的主要功能的概述：

* **简化的刚体模拟**

    * 在动画评估步骤中运行。

    * 在组件空间中运行以响应动画。

    * 没有碰撞，实现更快的模拟

    * 只支持盒体的惯性计算

* **刚体约束**

    * 角度 - 一个两轴约束，第三轴被锁定。刚体可以在给定的角度范围内绕两个自由轴旋转。与棱柱和平面约束配合使用

    * 锥体 - 自由旋转约束，使刚体保持在其约束的指定角度内。如果选择这个，则将与棱柱和平面约束配合使用，但取代角度

    * 棱柱 - 一种三轴线性约束，允许在规定的限制范围内沿所有三个主轴移动。

    * 平面 - 平面约束是刚体无法跨越的无限延伸平面的列表，可用作悬挂对象的接地面或用于阻止对象穿透角色。每一个平面都可以放置在世界场景空间中，或者由角色的骨骼驱动它的变换

* **链**

    * 每个节点既可以表示单个动态骨骼，也可以表示共享类似约束数据的连续动态骨骼链。这使得在模拟大量的连接体时可以实现更逼真的行为。

    * 对于单节点，我们只将力向下推到链上，而不将它们传播回去 - 对于链模式，我们向两个方向传播力，以得到更好的链

* **弹簧目标**

    * 使用线性弹簧和角弹簧可以得到更多的弹跳效果。这些弹簧是独立配置的，可以有不同的弹簧常量。

* **风**

    * 动画动态可以与影响APEX布料对象的相同风源Actor一起使用。这可以在每个节点上打开或关闭，并可缩放以创建完美的风振响应。

* **自适应分步**

    * 模拟可以使用物理项目设置中的法线标记设置运行，也可以使用自适应分步运行。 

    * 可以为每个节点配置模拟 - 因此，如果需要更多的迭代来模拟收敛，可以配置为拥有尽可能多的迭代，而不影响其他模拟。

    * 在这种模式下，我们分别跟踪游戏运行的时间和模拟实际运行的时间，如果我们开始落后，那么我们就会保留时间债并多次运行模拟。这加上了一个上限以停止螺旋问题，但可以提高复杂模拟的稳定性

* **可视化**

    * 当选择节点时，节点上有一些选项可以显示各种内容。可用的查看器包括：

        * 角度限制

        * 棱柱限制

        * 平面限制

        * 平面排除方法（球体与平面限制的碰撞）

(#new:)

## 新内容：从游戏进程中现场录制动画

您现在可以在 **实时游戏进程** 期间 **录制骨架网格体的动画**，并将其另存为动画序列资源！

![image alt text](image_19.gif)(convert:false)

该资源可以在引擎中使用，也可以作为FBX导出，以供第三方工具使用。这应该适用于任何活动的游戏场景，无论是实时还是观看重播。 

如何使用此功能：

* 要录制动画，打开控制台并键入：**RecordAnimation** MyActorClass_05 /Content/Foo/RecordedAnimation

* 要停止录制，键入：**StopRecordingAnimation **MyActorClass_05 或 **StopRecordingAnimation** all

* 如果省略或提供无效的资源路径，将会弹出一个选择器，您可以在其中进行选择。您可以使用世界大纲视图来查找感兴趣的Actor的名称（将鼠标悬停在Actor名称上，查看它的“ID名称”）

(#new:)

## 新内容：更高质量的景深

现在，您可以增加景深（“圆形景深”）的样本计数，通过减少噪点来提高质量，但要付出一些额外的性能代价。 

![image alt text](image_20.png)

(#new:)

## 新内容：平台和SDK更新

除了通常的更新，我们也更新了我们所有的主要VR平台，使用他们最新的SDK来准备在不同VR平台的发行窗口中发行作品。伴随着这些更新的是对稳定性和最终打磨的注重，所以4.11上的任何UE4标题都应该是“VR准备就绪！”

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_21.png)
[/REGION]

这个版本中平台的亮点：

* Oculus Rift 1.3.0 SDK即将在虚幻引擎4.11.1热修复补丁中登场。（虚幻引擎4.11.0中是Oculus Rift SDK 0.8.0 beta）  

* Oculus Mobile SDK 1.01

* Playstation VR SDK 3

* SteamVR 0.9.12

* PS4 SDK 3.008.201（带PSVR）

* Xbox One XDK November QFE 1

* HTML5 SDK (Emscripten) 1.35.0

* Linux Clang 3.7.0

* Apple tvOS 9.0支持（仅适用于GitHub）

(#new:)

## 新内容：改进的DirectX 12

![image alt text](image_22.png)

我们集成了微软在虚幻引擎中对DirectX 12的更新，以便在并行生成渲染命令的同时更好地利用CPU；还增加了对多个根签名的支持、默认启用异步管道状态磁盘缓存、减少内存占用并修复泄漏、资源转换优化、更快的内存分配和有限的GPU匮乏（通过在空闲GPU时间刷新工作）等改进。

(#directx12forxboxone)

### Xbox One的DirectX 12

微软的工程师们已经开始在 **Xbox One** 上增加对 **DirectX 12** 的实验支持！  

启用此功能需要一些步骤：

* 在BaseEngine.ini的XboxOneRuntimeSettings部分中将 **bBuildForD3D12** 设置为 **true**

* 在XboxOneShaderCompiler.cpp中将D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE设置为1

* 注释掉PostProcessSelectionOutline.usf中使用的GetSamplePosition（Xbox One尚不支持）

* 重新编译并重启！

由于其实验性质，启用后可能会出现渲染和/或稳定性问题。

(#new:)

## 新内容：Mac OS X上的Metal渲染

Metal现在是Mac OS X El Capitan上的默认图形API！

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_23.png)
[/REGION]

Epic已与苹果、AMD、NVIDIA和Intel密切合作，为Mac整合Metal，并在4.11取代OpenGL成为OS X El Capitan的主要图形API。默认情况下，4.11版本在Metal和OpenGL之间提供了相同的渲染特性。Metal提供了一个精简的、低开销的API，带有预编译着色器和高效的多线程支持，以最大化GPU的处理能力。我们将继续改进和扩展对Mac Metal的支持，并寻找在即将发布的引擎版本中利用新的API特性的方法。

还有实验性的Metal支持着色器模型5的特性，可以使用“-metalsm5”命令行开关进行尝试。

(#new:)

## 新内容：更快的照明构建（Intel Embree支持）

我们已经将 **Intel的Embree射线跟踪** 库集成到Lightmass，并用它极大地改进了照明构建。

大部分的照明构建时间都花在跟踪光线上，以了解光线是如何反弹的。作为一个测试用例，“太阳神庙”关卡照明现在使用Embree构建 **2.4倍速度**（从45秒到18秒）。在间接照明质量（Indirect Lighting Quality）设置为4的情况下，结果在视觉上是相同的。

(#new:)

## 新内容：Lightmass门户

室内的天空光源质量现在可以通过在开口上方设置门户Actor来大幅提高。

![image alt text](image_24.png)(w:640 convert:false)

门户告诉Lightmass在哪里寻找进入的光线；它们本身并不发光。门户最好覆盖对最终照明很重要的小开口。这产生了更高质量的光源和阴影，因为Lightmass可以将光线聚焦到入射光。（下图 **左侧**：无门户。下图 **右侧**：有门户）。

![image alt text](image_25.png)(w:640 convert:false)

在Lightmass质量方面还有其他一些改进：

* 修复点光源/聚光源/定向光源的漏光瑕疵，和静态照明关卡比例的小值。

* 天空光源间接照明得到改善

(#new:)

## 新内容：通过从网格体中复制来实现动画造型

我们已经添加了一个新的动画节点，它在动画图表中的骨架网格体组件之间复制一个姿势。这是主姿势组件的改进版本，因为现在可以将源动画与新动画混合在一起。 

![image alt text](image_26.gif)(convert:false)

在上面的例子中，Gauntlet使用自己的动画蓝图中的Copy Mesh Pose节点从源网格体（女性角色）复制手和手臂的变换。与此同时，Gauntlet的突刺正在独立地动画化。 

![image alt text](image_27.png)

我们将源网格体设置为从另一个网格体组件复制姿势。它只会复制骨骼名称匹配的转换。一旦从节点获得了这个姿势，就可以将其他动画混合进来。 

源网格体必须在目标之前进行动画化，当目标被附加到源时，这将自动发生，并且需要匹配关节名称。还要注意，骨骼变换是在物理模拟 *之前* 复制的，这意味着如果源网格体进行模拟，那么骨骼变换就不能实施，但是如果目标网格体是在物理运行 *之后* 动画化的，那么这就不是问题了。 

(#new:)

## 新内容：LOD骨骼减少工具

现在可以从骨架网格体LOD **移除骨骼**。骨架权重将自动更新！这是一种提高游戏角色动画性能的简单方法。

![image alt text](image_28.png)

在 **骨架树（Skeleton Tree）** 的右键菜单中使用新的 “移除子项（Remove Children）”选项，可以禁用任何给定LOD的骨骼。

![image alt text](image_29.png)

以前，此功能紧密耦合到网格体减少工具。现在您只需查看想要移除骨骼的LOD，选择所需的关节并移除它，如果您愿意，还可以移除子项。您还可以选择只从当前LOD中移除或包含所有较低的LOD。

一旦移除骨骼，它们会变成灰色，表明它们在当前LOD中没有蒙皮。Persona中的LOD预览模式在禁用时也会显示灰色的骨骼名称。  

最后，在骨架树（Skeleton Tree）工具栏中有一个新的“**LOD骨骼（LOD Bones）**”显示选项下拉框，用于过滤哪些骨骼可见。

![image alt text](image_30.png)

(#new:)

## 新内容：粒子挖剪（快速Flipbook粒子渲染）

粒子挖剪可使flipbook粒子渲染速度加快三倍！  

使用flipbook动画（Sub-UV动画模块）的粒子往往有相当多浪费的过度绘制 - 像素着色器必须执行的区域，但最终的不透明度为零。例如，下面的纹理主要由透明像素组成。

![image alt text](image_31.png)

我们现在可以用更紧密的边界几何体渲染粒子，去掉不可见的区域，而不是使用一个完整的四边形，不管动画正在播放的是什么帧。  

![image alt text](image_32.png)

(#setup)

### 设置

默认情况下，引擎不能使用粒子挖剪，因为材质图表允许任何逻辑创建粒子的不透明度 - 它甚至可能不是来自纹理。艺术家必须通过设置粒子挖剪来使用它。

1. 从flipbook纹理中创建一个新的“SubUV动画”资源（在内容浏览器中右键单击纹理）

![image alt text](image_33.png)

2. 打开“SubUV动画”资源，确保子图像（Sub Images）属性设置正确。前两个步骤只需要对每个flipbook纹理执行一次。

![image alt text](image_34.png)

3. 在级联中，找到SubUV模块并分配动画资源

![image alt text](image_35.png)

(#performanceresults)
### 性能结果

![image alt text](image_36.png)

在着色器复杂性视图模式下，使用挖剪时粒子系统中的过度绘制少的多。使用挖剪几何体将这个粒子系统的GPU成本减少了 **2-3倍**！

(#new:)

## 新内容：逐顶点半透明照明

现在可以使用新的 **逐顶点** 半透明照明设置 **加快渲染**。

![image alt text](image_37.png)(convert:false)

在材质编辑器中有两种新的半透明照明模式，可以计算逐顶点的照明

![image alt text](image_38.png)(convert:false)

* 逐顶点照明模式仅使用 **一半的着色器指令** 和纹理查找

* “体积逐顶点非定向（Volumetric PerVertex NonDirectional）”设置非常快 - 几乎与无光照材质相同！

* 我们建议尽可能多地使用逐顶点半透明照明。非常大的粒子或三角形属于例外情况，因为照明将内插在各个三角形上。

(#new:
)
## 新内容：照明通道

照明通道允许动态光源 **仅影响照明通道重叠的对象**。我们现在支持 **多达3个照明通道**。

![image alt text](image_39.png)

您可以设置基元组件或光源组件所在的通道。  

![image alt text](image_40.png)

* 这些对过场动画非常有用！例如，可以在角色上添加轮廓光，而不影响周围环境。

* 照明通道的影响是动态应用的 - 这意味着它不能使用静态光源。您需要使用静止的或可移动的光源。此外，照明通道只会影响对不透明材料的直接照明。

* 照明通道在使用时只增加了少量的GPU成本。

* 请注意，这只适用于延迟渲染，所以这将不可能用于使用SM5或Metal的Mobile或Mac。

(#new:)

## 新内容：立体空间化

 **3D空间化** 现在可在PC、Xbox One和PS4平台用于 **立体资源**。立体空间化本质上是将每个输入源通道（例如左通道和右通道）空间化，就好像它们是单源一样。左右通道的位置由发声器位置决定，此发声器位置的偏移量由音效衰减设置（Sound Attenuation Settings）中的一个新参数3D立体声扩展（3D Stereo Spread）设置。

![image alt text](image_41.png)

3D立体声扩展参数定义了游戏单位中左右通道之间沿着垂直于收听器-发射器矢量的矢量的距离。这意味着立体声通道扩展参数在世界坐标中，并且在侦听器距离发射器越远的地方，它将自然地折叠成一个单点源（左通道和右通道的总和）。 

![image alt text](image_42.png)

(#new:)

## 新内容：声聚焦

音效衰减（Sound Attenuation）设置资源现在支持 **声聚焦**，这是一个新功能，允许音效设计师根据相对于听众的音效方向自动控制各种参数。 

下图说明了方位设置：

![image alt text](image_43.png)

音效设计师指定方位角值，该值定义音效在焦点内和焦点外的时间。将这些方位角之间的相对音效位置内插，以在区域之间混合。新设置在音效衰减设置UStruct中指定：

![image alt text](image_44.png)

焦点值和非焦点值用于通过三种方式修改音效：距离缩放、音量缩放和优先级缩放。距离缩放用于通过缩放焦点内或焦点外的音效的表观距离，创建一个吊杆麦克风或变焦麦克风效果。音量缩放可以根据音效的可见性为其添加另一个衰减。优先级缩放用于降低（或增强）音效并发的音效优先级。

(#new:)

## 新内容：音效遮挡

UE4现在支持简单的基于光线投射的音效遮挡。要对音效使用启用遮挡计算，只需在音效衰减设置资源中指定它，如下图所示：

![image alt text](image_45.png)

如果对一个音效衰减对象启用了遮挡，那么为该对象播放的音效将对碰撞几何体执行光线投射，以确定音效是否被遮挡。如果确定音效被遮挡，它将应用给定的低通滤波器频率（Low Pass Filter Frequency）值和音量衰减。由于遮挡系统基于二进制光线投射（遮挡和未遮挡），因此提供了一个可选的遮挡插值时间，该时间将从未遮挡和遮挡的频率值进行插值。提供了一个可选的复选框，用于启用对复杂几何体的碰撞检查。 

(#new:)

## 新内容：音效并发

新的并发系统从音效实例中移除并发数据，并将其放入自己的资源中。您可以通过在内容浏览器的“新资源（New Asset）”菜单下选择“**音效并发（Sound Concurrency）**”来创建这些。

除了前面的最大计数和解析规则之外，新的音效并发对象还添加了一些其他与并发相关的附加功能，如下所述。 

 **限制至所有者（Limit To Owner）**

此框用于指示使用此并发播放的任何音效都应该尝试与音效的所有者一起执行其并发计数。如果没有音效的所有者（例如，它没有在Actor上播放或通过音频组件播放），那么它将计算并发性，就像没有选中复选框一样。这是为了能够限制每个Actor的并发性。

 **音量缩放（Volume Scale）**

此功能将音效分组为用于音量管理的并发组。当并发组中的多个生效同时播放时，较旧的音效将变得更安静。在此特性下，音效的音量缩放公式为：

VolumeScale = VolumeScaleSettingNewerSoundCount

其中 *VolumeScaleSetting* 是一个用户设置的值，*NewerSoundCount* 是在这个并发组之后开始的并发组当前正在播放的音效的数量。例如，如果音效A、B和C位于相同的并发组中，并在 *VolumeScaleSetting* 为0.9的情况下快速连续播放，它们将被调整如下：

A的VolumeScale = (0.9)2 = 0.81

B的VolumeScale = (0.9)1 = 0.9

C的VolumeScale = (0.9)0 = 1.0

换句话说，最新的音效不会受到影响，但每一个较旧的音效都将被回避，这样它的音量就会呈指数衰减，有效地充当了一个自动回避机制，将音效组合在一起。

 **新解析规则：停止最低优先级和停止最安静**

新的并发对象还引入了两个新的并发解析规则：停止最低优先级和停止最安静。 

停止最低优先级规则使用USoundBase对象（SoundCue、SoundWave等）上设置的优先级值。一旦达到并发组的限制，系统将运行组中的所有活动音效，并停止最低优先级的音效（如果新音效是最低优先级，则不播放）。

顾名思义，停止最安静规则的作用是：它不会根据距离（通常与音量相关，但不一定）停止播放，而是停止播放最安静的组中的音效，如果新音效最安静，则不播放新音效。最安静的音效被定义为在对音效的所有增益级进行评估后，音量刻度最小的音效。

 **将音效并发对象应用于音效**

要使用音效并发对象，只需将其提供给任何音效调用或音效对象，方法与音效衰减设置对象非常相似。下面是音波资源的详细面板。

![image alt text](image_46.png)

上面突出显示的新部分允许您插入对新音效并发资源的资源引用。

 **覆盖音效并发**

对于向后兼容性和首选旧行为的情况，都可以选择使用资源上的一组本地数据覆盖并发设置对象。在这种情况下，音效资源成为它自己的并发组，并且实现了通过资源实例限制并发的旧行为。转换为4.11的旧项目将自动为它们的音效资源使用覆盖设置。

## 新内容：基于标记的动画同步

![image alt text](image_47.png)

现在可以使用动画数据中的 **标记** 对动画进行 **同步**。在以前的版本中，同步两个动画的唯一方法是基于时间的 - 动画只是缩放以使它们的长度匹配。您可以通过右键单击通知轨迹并选择添加通知（Add Notify）->添加同步标记（New Sync Marker）来添加标记数据。 

初始版本的特性集如下：

* 只有在同一同步组内的动画才会同步。领先者驱动同一同步组中随后者的位置。

* 没有播放速率调整，播放速率始终是主动画的速率。

* 只对组内所有动画通用的标记进行同步。例如，如果一个动画缺少“右脚放下”标记，那么在确定该帧的位置时，所有动画都将忽略这些标记。

* 位置是基于领先者相对于其通用标记的相对位置来同步的。例如，如果领先者在其左右脚标记之间的25%距离处，则随后者将同步到其各自左右脚标记之间的25%距离处。

* 当同步组中的动画具有足够的匹配标记时，将自动使用基于标记的同步。否则，将使用原始的缩放长度同步行为。

* 蒙太奇还支持在混出的同时执行基于标记的同步，所以您可以无缝切换回其他动画。您可以在蒙太奇中找到同步组（Sync Group）设置。

## 新内容：动画蒙太奇的曲线混合

**蒙太奇** 现在支持 **曲线混合**。蒙太奇上的混入（Blend In）和混出（Blend Out）选项控制蒙太奇在播放时的混合方式。注意，如果播放额外的蒙太奇，将使用它的混入（Blend In）设置。

## 新内容：层级LOD大纲视图

新的 **层级LOD大纲视图（Hierarchical LOD Outliner）** 允许您可视化网格体actor的群集，并允许编辑各种HLOD设置和生成过程。

![image alt text](image_49.png)

(#materialgeneration)

### 材质生成

材质合并过程现在支持更多材质属性，比如逐顶点颜色、顶点位置和顶点法线。这意味着，诸如世界空间纹理、基于表面法线混入雪或苔藓、以及通过顶点颜色遮蔽材质层等技术，现在可以正确地使用HLOD。

一些特性仍然不受支持，比如逐像素法线和世界到切线转换。在这些情况下，或者在您希望为HLOD使用不同的或简化的材质的其他情况下，可以使用 **Material Proxy Replace** 节点。它的功能和 **Lightmass Replace** 节点很相像：“实时”输入在运行时使用，而“材质代理”输入仅在生成过程中使用。

除了 **世界设置（World Settings）** 面板外，材质合并过程的设置现在可以在 **HLOD大纲视图（HLOD Outliner）** 面板中找到。

(#proxymeshgeneration)

### 代理网格体生成

代理网格体生成已经被精简，并新近集成了Simplygon SDK，网格体生成过程的设置现在也可以在HLOD大纲视图（HLOD Outliner）面板中找到。

其他改进：

* 样条网格体现在受HLOD系统支持。

* 代理网格体/群集现在仅为可见（子）关卡显示、生成和构建。

* 自发光现在受材质合并过程支持。

* 使用不透明材质的静态网格体现在受材质合并过程支持。

## 新内容：复杂文本渲染（实验性）

我们正在努力向Slate添加 **从右到左** 和 **双向文本** 支持，包括对复杂形状文本的支持（比如阿拉伯语）。 

![image alt text](image_50.png)

此功能仍在初期阶段。我们鼓励您试用它并提供反馈，尽管在这个版本中某些区域的边缘可能还有些粗糙。

已知问题：

* 单行可编辑文本块目前不能处理复杂文本（只能处理多行可编辑文本，以及静态纯文本/富文本）。

* 不支持文本Actor或画布。

* 复杂文本渲染目前仅适用于WindowsMac和PS4版本。

(#new:)

## 新内容：高级蓝图搜索

蓝图搜索工具已经更新，以支持更高级的搜索功能（以获得更有针对性的结果）。

![image alt text](image_51.png)

* 现在可以在搜索中针对特定的元素，例如：节点、引脚、图表、函数、宏、变量、属性和组件。完整文档在此处：[https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/Search/index.html](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Blueprints/Search/index.html)

* 支持And (&&)和Or (||)逻辑运算，以及标签/值匹配（使用语法：Tag=Value）。

* 变量的“查找引用（Find References）”选项现在利用这个改进的功能进行更精确的搜索。

## 新内容：VR头戴式显示器摄像机改进

头戴式显示器的摄像系统已经进行了重构，使其具备更多功能且更易使用。它能使您的活动摄像机组件在引擎中抵消，就像您的头盔在现实世界中与它的起源相抵消。这意味着您可以轻松计算VR头盔在您的世界场景中的位置，将网格体和其他对象直接连接到它，并简化你的VR游戏的控制方案。

此外，任何附加到摄像机组件的东西都将“延迟更新”，这意味着它将使用尽可能最新的位置数据进行渲染，以减少延迟。连接到摄像机的网格、效果和sprite将被牢牢锁定在那里，并以与我们更新头戴式显示器本身相同的方式更新每一帧。

有关如何迁移当前项目以使用新系统的说明，请查看[更新的文档](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Platforms/VR/VRCameraRefactor/index.html)！

## 新内容：VR立体图层

立体图层允许您在一个单独的图层上绘制一个在世界场景中任何位置的带纹理四边形，这个图层直接被输入到VR的合成器中。这可以使UI可读性更高，失真更少。目前，这一功能只在Oculus Rift头盔上实现，但很快就会在其他平台上登陆！

## 新内容：序列器的主要进展（实验性）

序列器是我们新的非线性过场动画系统。序列器仍在大力开发中，我们不建议在生产工作中使用它，但欢迎您试用它并给我们反馈！期待在即将发布的UE4中听到更多关于序列器的信息。  

4.11版序列器中值得注意的新功能：

* 新轨迹：拍摄/导演、播放速率，慢镜头、淡出、材质、粒子参数轨迹。

* 改进了电影渲染；.EXR渲染支持。

* 改进了关键帧行为，复制或粘贴关键帧，从matinee复制关键帧，3d关键帧路径显示。

* 控制序列工作流，这样您就可以在更大的序列中拥有子场景

* 支持“可生成”（存在于您的过场动画资源中的Actor）

* UI改进：轨迹着色、关键帧形状/着色、轨迹过滤。

您可以通过打开插件（Plugins）面板并启用“关卡序列编辑器（Level Sequence Editor）”插件来打开序列器，然后重新启动编辑器。

### Animation

* **New:Level-of-Detail Threshold for Animation Graphs**

    * Many animation graph nodes now have an **LOD Threshold **option for **performance optimization**:

        * Apply Additive

        * Apply Mesh Additive

        * Aim Offset

        * All Skeletal Control nodes

    * Whenever the Skeletal Mesh instance drops below this LOD, the node will not execute.

![image alt text](image_52.png)

* **New:Per-Animation **Compression** Settings

    * You can now set **animation compression **on a **per-animation** basis. 

![image alt text](image_53.png)

* Choosing *Automatic* and then pressing *Apply* will cause the engine to determine the best setting (based on error metrics) and set that for you.

* New:Added "Delete All" option to anim curve panel.

* New:Added a new property called "Min Time Between Ticks" to particle systems.This can be used to force a lower tick rate on a particle system by specifying the minimum number of milliseconds between ticks.

* New:Added a new role for sync group members:TransitionLeader.It is excluded from the group while it blends in. Once it reaches full weight it becomes leader until it is fully blended out again.

* New:Added AssetRegistrySearchable tag to AnimSequence's EnableRootMotion property so that it shows in the content browser.

* New:Added blend profiles to skeleton assets, which allow per-bone multipliers when using blend per bone or other blending nodes.

    * These are accessible from the skeleton tree pane in Persona.

![image alt text](image_54.png)

* New:Added DrawCanvas and viewport string support to skeletal controls to enable them to output debug information to the viewport.

    * This feature can be enabled using the Show -> Display -> Skeletal Controls option in Persona's viewport,

* New:Added a flag to animation evaluator nodes so users can set whether they should loop when being ticked.

    * With the addition of Marker Based sync, evaluator nodes now have the ability to be ticked like sequence players (by adding them to a sync group). 

    * By default, the evaluator node's playing direction will be forward or backward based on whether the target time is earlier or later than the current time.

    * With the loop flag enabled the playing direction will be based on whichever direction will reach the target animation time more quickly.For example, going from 4.9 seconds to 0.1 seconds in a 5 second animation will play forward and loop instead of playing backward.

* New:Added GetCurrentStateName as a blueprint-accessible function on animation instances.

* New:Added a "Random Player" node for anim graphs.With this node, the user can play a selection of animations in a random order with certain randomized parameters.With Random Player, "Shuffle Mode" acts more like a randomized playlist, in that it will play everything on the list before repeating.

* New:Added SetMinLOD and SetForcedLOD functions.These enable the user to restrict LODs for the a specific SkeletalMeshComponent.

    * For example, calling SetMinLOD with 1 will mean that the component will not use LOD 0, even if it gets close to the camera, but it can use LODs 1 and higher as it normally would.

    * Similarly, calling SetForcedLOD with 0 will force the component to use only LOD 0 all the time.This can be useful for ensuring that the local player's character is always at maximum quality.

    * If both functions are used, SetForcedLOD will override SetMinLOD.

* New:Added support to tie update rate optimization directly to LOD level instead of selecting the amount based on screen size.

* New:Added a "Start Position" to the player node.The Sequence Player and BlendSpace Player both contain the Start Position parameter, which will start the animation at the given position on the first time it plays.

* New:Added support for space conversion in the copy-bone skeletal controller node.

* New:Added support to PoseableMeshComponents for the MasterPoseComponent property.

* New:Added the ability to remap to existing assets when retargeting in Persona.

    * Persona can also attempt to auto fill the correct assets if the source and destination assets use a similar naming scheme.

* New:Allow users to change animation compression settings per animation in the detail panel.

    * Note that you'll have to click "Apply" to apply to the current compressed data.If not, data will not match the displayed compression setting.

    * Default compression settings are in Project/Animation.

    * An automatic setting exists.This may take a while, as it will try all possible configurations and compare results, but it will find the optimal compression settings.

* New:Anim Montage now contains FAlphaBlend BlendIn/BlendOut option

    * Supports both preset and custom curve types.

* New:Blend List node now supports Reset Child On Activation for reinitialization when reactivated.

* New:Changed TrailRelaxation to Curve type, so that different relaxation values can be used on chains.

* New:Offline animation retargeting supports rules for naming output animations.

    * Rules supported:Target folder, Prefix, Suffix, Replace.

* New:Exposed SkeletalMesh property bDisableMorphTarget to blueprints.A new cvar, r.EnableMorphTargets, can be turned off to disable all morph targets.

* New:FBX import now saves animation length property.

* New:Persona Asset Browser displays folder path column.

    * Tooltip also displays folder path.

    * Sorting by path in the asset browser is supported.

* Bugfix:Error is reported instead of crashing when compiling an animation blueprint that has a missing skeleton asset and contains a ModifyBone node.

* Bugfix:Displaying the debug info of an AnimInstance object whose root node is null will no longer cause a crash.

* Bugfix:Blendspace editor does not crash when the editor opens for the first time.

* Bugfix:The random animation sequence player does not crash when there are no entries in the playlist.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when default transition pins are set to true.

* Bugfix:Reimporting a skeletal mesh that is currently open in Persona does not crash.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash with animation editing when the source data gets invalidated, possibly due to retargeting.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash with Blendspace having per bone set up when the interpolation value is 0.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash with invalid BlendSpace preview input coming when switching preview assets in Persona.

* Bugfix:Prevented a crash in Persona while reimporting data.

* Bugfix:Removed possible divide by zero in state machine transitions when using crossfade durations of zero.

* Bugfix:Fixed assert on executing blueprint code during post load when an animation wants to spawn a "needs re-saving" message.

* Bugfix:Fixed potential to call incorrect functions in derived anim blueprints, which could make derived anim blueprints function incorrectly.

* Bugfix:Importing corrupted FBX files no longer crashes.

* Bugfix:Fixed issue when importing curve values from FBX files with unwind rotation on.

* Bugfix:When importing curves, the break tangent doesn't work, so now import curve defaults to auto.

* Bugfix:Particle systems and other events triggered from anim notifies now work properly in the editor and at runtime.

* Bugfix:Root Motion from Everything is no longer calculated incorrectly with animations that are part of a sync group.

* Bugfix:Anim montage playback error correction is no longer incorrectly applied when the montage is stopped.

    * Removed iteration over the entire pose (we can start at the first bone in the transform list).

    * Removed bone masks and instead collect interesting nodes to perform conversion on.

    * Removed unnecessary conversions.

* The anim blueprint compiler can now access member variables directly instead of thunking to the VM.

* OSX version of the Maya rigging tools are now included in the launcher distribution.

* Some animation nodes have moved to AnimGraphRuntime module.

* Added a few support functions to UAnimInstance to make querying asset player states easier.Also added more montage stats to UAnimInstance.

* Animation Compression:"Automatic" animation compression settings now default to the settings specified in Project Settings:Animation:Compression.

* Reduced memory churn by removing many unnecessary allocations in various animation update and evaluate methods.

* Sub-state machines can now work properly with native bindings.Previously, only sub-state machines in entry states worked correctly.

### Audio

* New:Improved Gameplay Statics sound API.

    * New Spawn at Location functions return an Audio Component that allows manipulation of the played sound similar to the Attached version.

    * Play at Location still does not return the audio component and should be used for one-shot sounds.

    * Rotation added to Location and Attached API to allow facing to be specified to work properly with non-spherical attenuation shapes.

    * Play Attached renamed to Spawn Attached.

    * Sound and Dialogue APIs are now consistent.

* New:Added ability to set a global pitch scale for every non-UI sound in the game via a new blueprint function.

* New:Made audio component's applied sound attenuation settings accessible from blueprints.

* New:Orphaned sounds due to a Sound Node Looping now output a warning to the log.

* New:Sound attenuation boundaries match the attenuation curves at min/max.

* New:Sound attenuation values match attenuation curves at min and max rather than assuming 1.0 or 0.0 respectively.

    * This allows for more unusual distance-based attenuation curves, such as donut-shaped curves, or curves that cause audio to be loud far away but quiet nearby.

* New:Support for playing sounds with audio component properties without needing an audio component as long as the sound's properties do not change.

* New:XAudio2 voices for PC/XBoxOne platforms are pooled and reused.

* New:Volume-weight voice prioritization sorting for active voices.

    * This allows for sounds with zero volume, but high priority, to be stopped by lower priority, but audible, sounds.

    * Bugfix:This feature includes a fix for when sounds go out of range (attenuation reaches zero) and then come back in range while still active.If not stopped in between, the sound won't automatically restart from the beginning.

* Bugfix:Fixed a probable crash that could have happened if 9 reverbs became activated at once.

* Bugfix:Concatenator sound cue nodes will now wait for all sounds to finish in child mixer nodes before playing next sound in sequence.

* Bugfix:On PC/XBoxOne, an audio skip in sounds past a certain length have been removed.

* Bugfix:On Mac, splitting and merging audio streams when using reverb, EQ, or radio effects no longer causes volume levels to to change.

    * Added low-pass filter for voice audio units to closer match PC audio.

* Bugfix:Play In Editor Sound Quality Level is now being used correctly for Sound Quality nodes in Sound Cues when playing in editor.

* Bugfix:A rare case where a sound would not be played because an async load request had been made too recently has been fixed.

* Bugfix:Core Audio API no longer crashes on Mac when the number of active sounds exceeded the number of available audio units.

* Updated OVR Audio SDK.

### Automation

    * Also specifies whether platforms are available for code or content projects only

* New:Added -FastPDB commandline parameter for UnrealBuildTool, so that we can make use of the /DEBUG:FASTLINK option in Visual Studio 2015

    * Used by default in Visual Studio Projects and Hot Reload, with a Build Configuration override if you don't want to use it

* New:Adding option to mark the output of a module as publicly distributable if the module source code is not

* New:Improved methods of identifying installed builds

* New:Improved methods of identifying installed builds

* Deprecating -rocket command line argument as it is no longer needed to identify installed builds

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when running automation tests from the commandline.

* Bugfix:Fixed issue with Packaging DLC on Mac

* Bugfix:Use runtime dependencies from module files to determine what needs to be included in released builds

### Blueprints

* **New:Blueprint "Development Only" Functions**

    * Native C++ functions marked *BlueprintCallable* can now also be optionally marked as *DevelopmentOnly*.This new metadata allows calls to those functions to be disabled (compiled out) of all Blueprint function graphs in cooked/packaged builds without breaking the execution flow.![image alt text](image_55.png)

* The *PrintString* and *PrintText* system library functions have now been marked *DevelopmentOnly* by default.This allows for a quick removal of Blueprint logging in the final build product.

* To get packaged/cooked Blueprints to compile without the "*DevelopmentOnly*“ nodes, disable the “Compile Blueprints in Development Mode" option found in the project's Cooker settings (this option is on by default to preserve functionality).

* **New:Condensed Blueprint Struct Nodes**

    * We've improved and refined usability for structs that contain toggle values that are conceptually linked to other property "settings" in the same struct (like how our PostProcessSettings struct operates).![image alt text](image_56.png)

* Different override/enabled states are now managed through a toggle or dropdown widget that is exposed along with the setting on "Make Struct" and “Set Member” nodes.

* To associate a toggle variable with another property, use the "*EditCondition*" metadata like is pictured above.

* We've adopted this workflow for our PostProcessSetting nodes, which have proven to be unwieldy and confusing without it.

* New:Added advanced searching syntax to Find-in-Blueprints.

* New:Added experimental option to use the Blueprint Diff Tool with Animation Blueprints and Widget Blueprints.

* New:Added facilities for specifying override vertex colors for meshes via Blueprints:PaintVerticesSingleColor and PaintVerticesLerpAlongAxis.

    * PaintVerticesSingleColor sets all mesh vertices to the specified color.

    * PaintVerticesLerpAlongAxis allows you to specify a linear blend along a mesh axis from one color to another.

* New:Added Min and Max nodes for byte variables.

* New:Added CopyPoseFromSkeletalMesh node, which takes a snapshot of a skeletal mesh pose and applies it to another skeletal mesh component.

* New:Added support to AsyncTask nodes so that their corresponding functions can return null.

* New:Added the ability to mark BlueprintCallable functions as development only.

    * By default, these nodes will be compiled out of Blueprint class function graphs at cook/package time, potentially improving runtime performance.

    * The "Print String" and "Print Text" functions are now marked as development-only, and will not be executed at runtime in cooked builds by default.

* New:Added asset registry tags "NativeComponents" and "BlueprintComponents" to store the number of native and blueprint components, respectively.These counts can be used to identify targets for optimization.

* Blueprint context menu performance improved.

* By default, Buildmachines will no longer ignore compile on load errors for Blueprints.

* Users can no longer edit Actor default values on properties in User Defined Structs or in CDOs that have structs with Actor properties.

* New:Users can now delete function graph overrides that used to be interface implementations.

* Bugfix:Crash fix when undoing add/remove operations on default instanced subobjects in a Blueprint.

* Blueprint division nodes now show the callstack if a divide by zero is attempted.

* During undo/redo, when deleted Blueprint instances are restored to the scene, they will be reinstanced using the newest version of their BlueprintGeneratedClass.

* New:GetPathName node created.This node returns the full path name of a UObject.

* New:Exposed many scalability settings to Blueprints via UGameUserSettings, making it easy to build a settings screen entirely in UMG.

* New:The Blueprint Profiler is now available as an experimental feature to help identify costly operations in blueprints and guide optimization.

    * Enable the Blueprint performance analysis tools option in editor preferences under General - Experimental in the Blueprints section.

    * Analysis is currently enabled on a per-blueprint basis in PIE only.

    * To profile a blueprint, enable the profiler option in the blueprint editor and recompile the blueprint to add instrumentation.Then enter PIE and the editor will display the blueprint profiler tab and display timing data.

    * Work is ongoing in this area and the feature is not expected to be fully complete in this release.

* New:Vector2D now has equal and not equal functions, just like Vector3D.

* New:Improved the asset gathering and path prioritization workflow for very large projects.

    * Previously, the file discovery phase of the asset gathering process would block the entire process until it had found all of the files it needed to test.

    * This can take quite some time for projects with a large amount of assets, so this change adjusts the process so that discovered paths will be reported back to the asset registry while the file discovery is on-going.This allows you to prioritize the scanning of certain folders before the initial discovery phase has finished.

* Bugfix:Visualization sub-components for camera component could end up duplicated and one version would be in the incorrect location.

* Spectator pawn movement now accounts for per-actor time dilation.

* Bugfix:Fixed USplineComponent::GetInputKeyAtDistanceAlongSpline for closed loops so that the correct value is returned when the input key lies on the closing segment of the loop.

* Bugfix:Level streaming will now correctly handle "package async load failed" event

* Bugfix:GameInstance objects will no longer be leaked when exiting Play In Editor due to referenced objects preventing garbage collection.

    * When PIE ends all Objects outered to the GameInstance are now marked pending kill in the same way that Objects outered to the World are.

* Bugfix:GetInputKeyTimeDown now returns correct value for Touch inputs.

* Bugfix:Changing the values of the Main and Alt Input Keys for a Touch Interface now works correctly.

* Bugfix:Actor destruction will no longer output warnings about moving a component with a non-movable mobility.

* Bugfix:Actors being spawned during another Actors' BeginPlay during map load will no longer cause ensure() to be called.

* Bugfix:Component overlaps now always end when a component is destroyed.

* Bugfix:High res screenshot will not break focus in full screen games.

* Bugfix:Incorrect Begin/End overlap events are no longer run when BeginOverlap is used to disable collision or overlap events on the other object.

* Bugfix:Actors/Components will no longer tick until BeginPlay() has been called when in a game world.This was an issue in some situations in network games.

    * Actors may opt out of this by setting bAllowTickBeforeBeginPlay to true.APlayerController, AInfo and derived classes (AGameMode, AWorldSettings, etc) enable this by default because they typically have match start up logic.

    * Components with no Actor owner will start ticking immediately before the world begins play.This should be rare however.

    * Editor worlds don't "begin play", so ticking begins immediately in those.

* Bugfix:GameplayCues will no longer be invoked from ActiveGameplayEffectsContainer::NetDeltaSerialize when there are unmapped objects.This was causing GameplayCues to be invoked with incomplete information in their EffectContext.	

* Bugfix:Timers that are set and paused in the same frame now keep track of their remaining time correctly.

* Null pointer checks on LocalPlayer->ViewportClient have been added to PlayerController.cpp.

* bShowDebugForReticleTarget in the HUD is no longer static.

* AInfo's root component in editor builds is now set to the sprite component.This avoids AInfo subclasses generating warnings when going into PIE.

* ChildActors now inherit their visibility from the owning component and actor visibility.

* Keys bound via key or action events will now count as having consumed the event even if there wasn't a pressed or released event this frame.This prevents axes from using the key in lower priority input components in future frames.

* Lighting and vertex coloring now persists correctly for Child Actor Components.

* Memory corruption no longer occurs due to improper clean up of GameplayDebuggingReplicator

* Network clients now sync physics simulation state (on/off) from the server if bReplicateMovement is true.

* OnComponentDestroyed now ensures and logs an error about the inconsistency instead of crashing in the case a component is in the AttachChildren array, but has no AttachParent.

* Optimized FURL construction when passed a short map name by trying the asset registry before resorting to a disc search.This can save 10-20 seconds when issuing an "open mapname" console command on some platforms.

* OnComponentBeginOverlap has been prevented from triggering more than once in some cases, usually when the event tries to disable collision or overlaps.

* DestroyActor calls will no longer recurse.

* Removed allocations in player input system.

* In USceneComponent, AttachTo() now returns a bool indicating if attachment is successful (or if already attached).OnRegister() now clears AttachParent and AttachSocketName if the AttachTo() call fails.

    * Fixes AttachParent still being set when initialized in a constructor but when the attachment is invalid.

* When destroying a component, attached children will now remain correctly at the same world position.

* Whether or not to draw subtitles will now take immediate effect rather than waiting for the next sound to play.

* Improved error message when SpawnActor fails due to the spawned actor being marked pending kill.

### Learning Resources

* New:Clarified some comparison functions (IsZero, IsNearlyZero, Equals) in FRotator to explain that they compare as orientations, not other interpretations such as rotational speed, winding, etc.

#### Sample Content

* Bugfix:Old file was checked out.Had to revert.

### Localization

* New:Added ability to opt out of adding reference comments as extracted comments when exporting localization to PO files.

* New:Added new setting for localization import/export in order to persist comments in PO files that aren't generated from manifest/archive.

* New:Culture names now consistently use hyphens rather than underscores.Culture names with underscores are still accepted.

* New:First pass of the OneSky plugin:Extend Localization Dashboard toolbar with OneSky buttons for "Import all cultures/targets from OneSky" and "Export all cultures/targets to OneSky"

* New:Improved the text gather from assets

    * We now gather the texts from Blueprints using their generated class and script bytecode.This avoids polluting a game gather with all of the editor-only texts that come from the K2 nodes in the blueprint asset.

    * The objects within a package are now gathered recursively, as this correctly honors the editor-only flags used by the containing object (this both recurses by walking properties - to detect editor-only properties - but also by gathering all of the inner objects at each level).

    * We now recurse through and gather from map properties.

    * Fixed texts of differing case being combined when gathering from assets.

    * Editor tutorial BPs are now gathered as as editor-only.

* New:Overall improved Editor Region & Language settings page.

* New:Blueprint text pins now generate a new key each time they are set, rather than use a deterministic key

    * This matches what text properties do, and removes the possibility of having a duplicate key (eg, if you serialized some data from a BP pin, changed the BP pin text, and then reloaded the data).

* Bugfix:FTextLocalizationManager::UpdateFromLocalizationResource was discarding the data it had loaded

* Bugfix:Crash on the Chinese version of Windows version when changing the editor language

* Bugfix:Some FText instances were not rebuilding correctly when the culture is changed

* Bugfix:The culture display name was not updating when the culture was changed

* Bugfix:The Category Names of Components in blueprints are no longer gathered for localization when the "ShouldGatherEditorOnlyData" setting is false.

* Bugfix:The editor now loads all available cultures

    * It only used to load EFIGSCJK culture data, which prevented you being able to localize for other cultures.

* Bugfix:The spoken text of dialogue wave assets are now gathered for localization under the root localization namespace, rather than a "Dialogue" namespace.

* Bugfix:The translation editor now properly supports viewing and editing the individual translations for different contexts of a dialogue wave's spoken text.

* Updated PO export/import logic to use generate msgctxt based on namespace and, conditionally, key (only if key metadata is present) and added info metadata as extracted comments.

### Networking

* New:Added ability to force various replay failure conditions.Use demo.ForceFailure to enable.1 Will force failure during initial call to start streaming.2 will simulate load map failure.

* New:Added an initial implementation of an InMemoryNetworkReplayStreaming module.

    * Unlike NullNetworkReplayStreaming and HttpNetworkReplayStreaming, this implementation doesn't rely on the disk or network, and as a result is generally much faster.

    * It is intended to be used for specific cases where a local, transient replay would be useful.

* New:Added initial support for game clients to record replays.Previously replay recording was only supported on servers.

    * A client replay will only record the client's view of the world, so actors that are not considered network relevant to the client will not be present in the replay.

    * Note that RPCs are not currently supported in client replays.

* New:Added new Lobby module for a server to host a lobby via beacons before actually connecting to the server itself.Actor replication and classes similar to AGameMode (ALobbyBeaconHost), AGameState (ALobbyBeaconState), APlayerController (ALobbyBeaconClient), and APlayerState(ALobbyBeaconPlayerState) added.

* New:Added -REPLAY= cmdline option, which allows you to play a replay from the cmdline

* New:Added server network stats that measure in/out bandwidth per client connection (min among clients, max among clients, average among clients).

* New:Added task system to replay systems internals for more code maintainability, and stability.

* New:Allow ping to subtract server and client frame time from ping to try and predict what true cloud ping is

    * Set net.PingExcludeFrameTime to 1 to test this out

* New:Better networking logging format.Example:[2015.08.03-21.06.12:006][285]LogNet:UChannel::CleanUp:ChIndex == 0.Closing connection.[UChannel] ChIndex:0, Closing:0 [UNetConnection] RemoteAddr: x.x.x.x:xxxx, Name:IpConnection_1, Driver:IpNetDriver_3 IpNetDriver_3, Server:YES, PC:NULL, Owner:BeaconClient_0

* New:Changed the stats port format to be "HTTP-like" (just enough to be compatible with curl/wget/etc)

    * stubbed out a super basic framework for being able to issue exec commands via this port (not open by default and binds only to loopback)

* New:Custom events are now supported in demo replays.An event has custom metadata and data and is tied to a timestamp in the replay.

* New:Allow for servers to create multiple voice data channels.

* New:Initial Oodle support as a plug-in added.This is work in progress, and will improve over time.

* New:Lots of networking profiler improvements:

    * Restore chart position when loading new charts after applying filters

    * Draw last selected range as a transparent red overlay to remind you where selection is after zooming out/scrolling

    * Re-calculate selected range when filters are applied

    * Fixed more anchoring issues when maximizing window

    * Removed default chart series from designer since we add these programmatically now

    * Added context menu strip for future right click capabilities to be added

    * Differentiating replicated actor count from total actor count to give a sense of waste

    * Added "hz" to end of count/s items in summary * Added "Bytes/s" when representing bytes per second in summary

    * Added tabs for summary, actor perf, and details

    * Actor perf view how uses a list view, with actual columns you can sort by

    * Added combo box for search filters that fill in automatically fill in with searchable data, and supports auto-complete

    * Added "Waste" columns to actor perf view, which shows how much an actor updates vs actually replicates something

    * Add KB/s in actor details view + more anchoring fixes

    * Allow loading partial networking profiles (so you no longer have to force a level change to save the profile)

* New:Messaging:Implemented interceptor tracing

* New:Minor improvement to the setup/tick logic of the perf counter module query port implementation.Should prevent "connection not ready" timeout issues that occur sporadically.

* New:Optimized networking CPU time somewhat by not ticking network channels that don't need to be ticked.

* New:The NullNetworkReplayStreaming implementation can now play back live games.This is useful for testing with multiple instances of the game running on the same machine.

* New:The replay streamer implementation module to use can now be overridden at runtime.

    * You can pass the name of the module to use into FNetworkReplayStreaming::GetFactory, or you can use the "ReplayStreamerOverride=" URL option.The URL option is useful when combined with the "DemoRec" URL option.

    * If neither of these overrides is provided, the implementation will fall back to the one defined by the "DefaultFactoryName" in the Engine configuration file, as before.

* New:The replay streaming system can now scrub to a new time while playback is paused.Try it out in ShooterGame!

* New:UdpMessaging:Added console commands for basic diagnostics

* New:Allow replay chunks to request downloads even if something else is in-flight or pending

* Bugfix:Added missing socket error type ENODEV

* Bugfix:Removed bug in FNetViewer::FNetViewer that could cause the view location to be at (0,0,0) when nothing was hit which would then cause the net relevancy distance check to fail.

* Bugfix:Character movement component now has better smoothing when going up/down terrain in replays

* Bugfix:Disconnect instead of assert when channels receive reliable packets before fully opening (this can happen from malicious clients)

* Bugfix:A fatal error if a replication notify function couldn't be found at runtime.Now a warning will be logged and the notify function will simply be skipped.

* Bugfix:Replays were not recording at intended framerate

* Bugfix:RPC's weren't being sent to connections + fixes warning spam where rpc's were getting rejected

* Bugfix:Issues when replay scrubbing was aborted mid scrub

* Bugfix Crash that happens when server stops recording replays

* Bugfix:Crashwhen loading older replays

* Bugfix:Bug prevented HTTP retries from working.TimeSinceLastResponse was not getting reset with ElapsedTime so once a request timed out it would always time out N more times until the retry sys gives up

* Bugfix:Bug caused the incorrect IRepChangedPropertyTracker to be passed to the UActorComponent::PreReplication function during replay recording.The tracker is now correctly looked up in the demo net driver instead of the game net driver.

* Bugfix:Crash  occured when many static meshes set to replicate movement were placed in a level.

* Bugfix:Crashed when the server stops recording a replay.

* Bugfix:Fixed a race condition in UdpMessaging

* Bugfix:Replay recording could cause large portions of "dead air" to be saved into the replay if there were slow frames during recording.

* Bugfix:An issue caused the output log to spam "no owning connection" warnings when a client used the "ToggleDebugCamera" console command.

* Bugfix:An issue occurred while connecting a client to a server while in Play In Editor (PIE) mode during runtime might fail and instead load the default map.The travel to the server's world should now succeed.

* Bugfix:FNetViewer::FNetViewer could cause the view location to be at (0,0,0) when nothing was hit which would then cause the net relevancy distance check to fail.

* Bugfix:Incorrect receive buffer size in UdpSocketReceiver

* Bugfix:If the server detected a malicious packet, the connection would then remain open until session manually stopped

* Bugfix:Fixed typo in property tooltip and comments

* Bugfix:Lots of cleanup and improvements to how we smooth out character movement in replay playback.

* Bugfix:Lowered the verbosity of networking logs involving doubly acked packets, and out of sequence packets (this is completely normal when there is packet loss)

* Bugfix:Messaging:Fixed message bridge not unregistering remote endpoints on shutdown

* Bugfix:Networking:Processing UDP receive buffer only if bytes received.

* Bugfix:Ping calculation fixes:

    * Fix bug where extra acks were contributing to ping.

    * Call FlushNet on frames where SendAck was called.

    * Use wall time when calculating pings.

    * Stop subtracting half of frame time from ping.

* Bugfix:Properly go back to default map, and recover from error gracefully when replay level fails to load.

* Bugfix:Replay scrubbing stability fixes.

* Bugfix:Sockets:Setting number of bytes read to zero on failure.

* Bugfix:Temporarily disable seamless travel in PIE when using single process until proper fix comes in (it results in crash otherwise).

* Bugfix:UdpMessaging:Always forcing service restart on settings changes.

* Bugfix:UdpMessaging:Avoid an extra copy of outbound message data.

* Bugfix:UdpMessaging:Fixed a race condition during message serialization.

* Bugfix:When replay events fail to download, it's no longer catastrophic (won't cancel playing the replay), will return error instead.

### Online

* New:Added a function to the replay streamer to retrieve the custom event data for a specific event.

* New:Added a reconnecting state for parties.

* New:Added delegates that report download progress for OnlineTitleInterface's reading of files from a remote server

* New:Added functionality to the network replay streamer to be able to search for any events from a specified group.

* New:Added the following console commands related to replays:

    * demoscrub <seconds>: jumps to the given time in seconds in the replay

    * demospeed <speed>: sets the playback speed for the replay.As an example, demospeed 1.5 sets the speed of the replay to 1.5 times the normal speed.

    * demopause: pauses the replay if it is paused, or unpauses if it is already paused.

* New:BuildPatchServices will skip running of prerequisites that were previously completed successfully

* New:Created an early version of a runtime hotfix system.This is a WIP and is not fully complete yet.

* New:Exposed username/password settings for logging into an online service (OSS) while running Play In Editor (PIE).If enabled/defined, the credentials will be used to login before PIE actually begins.Not all online services support multiple sign-ins on the same machine.

* Bugfix:SSO domain checks would return false positives if a whitelisted domain appeared in the query string portion of the url.

* Bugfix:Collision for the spectator pawn is no longer disabled by default in network replays.

* Bugfix:Rejoining a steam lobby quickly after leaving would caused the player to get booted from the session.

* Bugfix:Making sure that In App Purchase callbacks for making a purchase, restoring purchases, and querying purchases still get triggered when the game is paused.

* Bugfix:Making sure that the logged in player's GooglePlay Player ID and Name get saved after GooglePlay Login UI completes successfully

* Bugfix:The demorec and demoplay console commands have been disabled while in Play In Editor (PIE), due to likely crashes and unreliability with saving and loading replays.Demorec has also been disabled if a replay is already playing back.

### Other

* **New:****Stat Budget View

    * A new budget view allows you to configure which stats you want to see (across different stat groups if needed) and gives you a running total that is broken down by threads.This view is useful for prioritizing CPU performance for different features of characters and gameplay objects.You can assign a total budget per thread.

![image alt text](image_57.png)

A view is specified in your DefaultEngine.ini by creating a new section and use that section name as the budget name.

[MainPlayerHero]

+Stats=STAT_AnimGameThreadTime

+Stats=-STAT_BlueprintUpdateAnimation

+Stats=-STAT_Montage_Advance

+Stats=STAT_PerformAnimEvaluation_WorkerThread

+Stats=STAT_ClothTotalTime

+Stats=FPhysXClothTask

GameThread=0.25

MergedTaskGraphThreads=1.0

A "-" in front of the stat indicates that this stat should not be counted for the running total since a parent stat is already accounting for the time.

To bring up this view simply use budget <section name>

You can also filter stat and budget groups by root strings.For example, "stat anim -root=MainPlayerHero" will show the stats that you'd expect from “stat anim” but will filter by UObjects that have “MainPlayerHero” as a substring of their name.This is not limited to UObjects as it's simply looking at parent stats with that substring in their name.

Stats are automatically broken into the threads they execute on and can appear in multiple threads if that is the case.

* New:Added benchmarking of Linux clock sources on start in order to determine which one is the fastest and diagnose performance problems earlier.

* New:Added GetTimeStampPair() to the platform file interface, for performance improvements

    * Used for situations like localization where we know that a pair of files will always exist in the pak file or not at all.If one exists but the other doesn't, we don't check the lower level IO layer, saving a lot of time in platform specific IO calls!

* New:Changed cache line size to 64 for PS4 and Xbox

    * To override the system-installed CA certificates, create a CurlCertificates directory in the project's Contents directory for a ca-bundle.pem text file, then in Packaging Project Settings add this directory as an additional non-asset directory to package.If you want to add your own certificates instead of overriding them, place a ca-additions.pem file here instead.NOTE: pem file must use Unix line endings (LF only, not CR/LF)!

* New:Optimized media playback to remove extra copies and fixed SetRate so pausing playback works

* New:Implemented audio seek functionality on android platform 

* New:The user can now specify the relative priority for each Android texture format in Project Settings.

    * This will affect the texture format used when Launching on Device

    * With "r.UseAsyncShaderPrecompilation” enabled shader precompilation is now executed on the render thread alongside the predraw, not as a single operation on loading the binary cache.

    * The setting "r.TargetPrecompileFrameTime" controls what the target frame rate should be when performing async. precompile and the shader cache will try and adjust how many shaders to precompile to stay within this limit, with a minimum of 1 shader per frame.

    * Removed special handling on the Intel HD 3000 GPU on Mac - we no longer officially support OpenGL 3.3 GPUs.

    * Removed the explicit sRGB encoding/decoding in shaders as AMD have fixed sRGB render target support in OS X El Capitan.

    * Removed the Mac-specific change to HZB texture format and instead attempt to optimise the CPU texture read back for this particular texture.

* Bugfix:Fixed wrong colors and artifacts when using color grading (extreme red in darks or more subtle ones)

* Bugfix:The near depth of field blur should occur after separate translucency is merged in to the final frame buffer to avoid errors

* Bugfix:The shadow color of FCanvasTextItem is now drawn before the outline color.

* Bugfix:Give access to SceneDepth in worldPositionOffset

* Bugfix:Improved ScreenSpaceSubsurface quality

* Bugfix:Instanced stereo rendering only available on D3D SM5 and PS4.Packaging for other platforms have this disabled.

* Bugfix:Now LensFlares are off by default (project settings prevented it)

* Bugfix:Prevented a possible access of uninitialized memory in ribbon emitters

* Bugfix:Texture import causes the texture to be compressed processed twice (was only for DDS_cubemaps, DDS_2d, HDR and IES)

* Bugfix:Texture processing:Alpha channel was missing sharpening effect

* Bugfix: ubsurfaceScatteringProfile for OpenGL (appeared to not have a BaseColor applied / grey)

#### FX

* New:Cascade:Added a viewport overlay display of 'Completed' when a self-terminating system has finished playing (controlled in the View..View Overlays menu)

* New:Added a number of useful particle system properties as asset registry searchable data

    * FixedBoundsSize (maximum component of the fixed bounds or None if it does not not use fixed bounds)

    * NumEmitters (number of emitter modules)

    * NumLODs (number of levels of detail)

    * LODMethod (method of computing which LOD to use)

    * LODDistanceCheckTime (interval of LOD checking when LOD mode is automatic)

    * Looping (True if the emitter will keep playing forever without external intervention)

    * These will show up in the content browser as tooltips or in the columns view, but unloaded particle systems will not have values for these columns until they are resaved!

* New:Added flag Auto Deactivate for particle systems.This will automatically deactivate particle systems that have completed and won't spawn again, even if the emitter duration hasn't expired yet.This can help performance by essentially auto-trimming the duration, especially useful for non-looping burst-only systems that don't continuously spawn particles.

* New:GPU particles are now simulated using fixed timestep, allowing different frame times and gameplay time scales to generate consistent results.

    * The fixed timestep is configurable through the ini variable "r.GPUParticle.FixDeltaSeconds".

    * A tolerance is configurable through "r.GPUParticle.FixTolerance" to prevent small variation of frame time to affect the number of iterations required.

    * The maximum number of iterations is limited by configuring "r.GPUParticle.MaxNumIterations".This prevents long frame from having costly simulations.

* New:It is now possible for deferred decals to access the underlying scene normals if they are not also updating it.

* New:Particle Effect lights can now be made 'high quality'.In those mode they go through the normal deferred lighting path.High Quality FX lights can also now become shadow casters.Content creators should use these sparingly as the performance impact can become very high, very quickly.

* New:Added a 'auto deactivate' flag for particle systems, that will automatically deactivate them if they can never again spawn particles.Useful for burst-only emitters, to not need to hand-trim emitter lifetime precisely.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to hang after being minimized or losing focus and coming back to it, if GPU particles are visible.

* Bugfix:Fixed a case where fog used incorrect data.

* Bugfix:Fixed animated particle emitter attributes not being animated when time exceeded 1 second.

* Bugfix:Fixed non-sprite emitters not being checked for bHasPhysics during PostLoad()

* Bugfix:Fixed particles with "Generate Spherical Particle Normals" having wrong normals when used with the pivot offset module.

* Bugfix:Increased size of curve texture used for GPU particle curves (now 512x256)

* Bugfix:Prevent particle system bounding boxes from being typed in the wrong way around (with Min > Max)

#### Lighting

* New:Added new PrimitiveComponent setting bSingleSampleShadowFromStationaryLights

    * When enabled, shadowing of a movable component from a stationary directional light will come from the Volume Lighting Samples precomputed by Lightmass

    * This provides essentially free on/off shadow receiving on dynamic objects, with a fade over time between states

    * Lighting has to be rebuilt once for this to work

* New:Added SourceCubemapAngle to sky lights, so the incoming lighting can be rotated

* New:Lightmap streaming fixes - Changed the default MaxLightmapRadius from 2k to 10k, as the previous default made thousands of tiny textures.

* New:Lightmass triangle normal is now averaged over the lightmap texel, improves cases where a small ledge near the texel center causes the final gather to be self-occluded.

    * The lighting position is no longer offset when detecting intersecting surface frontfaces within a texel.This was causing fully shadowed artifacts in cracks, as one side of the crack would move the shading position into the other.

* Bugfix:Fix for objects being culled by the near plane of the shadow frustum with RTDF shadows (shadow casters behind the camera pop out)

* Bugfix:Fixed a case where self-shadowing would break when selecting an object.

* Bugfix:Fixed a minor self-shadowing artifact.

* Bugfix:Fixed a rare case where Lightmass would hang on the final stage.

* Bugfix:Fixed an IndirectLighting cache bug where an IndirectLighting policy was still chosen even if a mesh had selected ILC quality OFF.

* Bugfix:Fixed lightmass exporter being deleted before the swarm connection is closed, causing occasional crashes when canceling a lighting build

* Bugfix:Fixed line light source shadows in lightmass

* Bugfix:Fixed several incorrect interactions between HLODs and Lightmass.

* Bugfix:Fixed skylight occlusion maps being generated from Lightmass for static skylights.Reduces lightmap encoding time, disk space and memory when only a static skylight is present.

* Bugfix:Fixed skylights on translucency in projects with static lighting disabled

* Bugfix:Fixed spot lights not generating cast shadows

* Bugfix:Fixed translucent self-shadowing on static meshes using the static draw path

* Bugfix:Fixes for building lighting in a commandlet

* Bugfix:More graceful handling of overflowing object count for distance field shadowing and DFAO

* Bugfix:Objects with 0 scale are excluded from the distance field scene, fixes bugs with several lighting methods with 0 scale objects

* Bugfix:Removed shading terminator bias meant for shadow map acne but it made character faces look worse.

* Bugfix:The static shadow depth map used to shadow translucency from Stationary lights is now saved properly during a blueprint construction script

#### Materials

* New:Added Dithered Opacity Mask option for materials.

* New:Derive Tangent Basis:New material function can derive a tangent basis from a specified UV channel in order to use normal maps from UV channels other than 0.Can also output a world normal transformed into the derived basis.

* New:Give access to SceneDepth in WorldPositionOffset

* New:Parallax Occlusion Mapping: added checkbox to use worldcoordinates which skips tangent space transform.For xy world coordinate materials.

* New:Parallax Occlusion Mapping: fixed compile error on macs caused by uninitialized variable.

* New:TextureCoordiate ID now shown in the caption in a materialexpression.

* New:Unit Vector to Octahedron and Octahedron to Unit vector:New material functions for packing v3 vectors as v2 and vice versa.

* New:Virtual Plane Coordinates:Updated this material function to include the UV coordinates of the plane.

* Bugfix:Automatically migrate View/Frame uniform usage in material custom nodes.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash which occurred when overriding the blend mode of a distortion material to opaque in a material instance.

* Bugfix:Fixed DepthFade material node

* Bugfix:Fixed issue with distortion not rendering on opaque materials that have been overridden to be translucent in an instance.

* Bugfix:Fixed issues with volumetric deferred decals (quality, baked shadows, depth out) partly from Inigo Quilez

* Bugfix:Fixed UI materials not working with separate translucency

* Bugfix:Materials using separate translucency should now work in stereo mode or other multiple-view scenarios.

* Bugfix:Shader compiler emits a warning when instanced stereo is enabled but not supported for the target RHI

#### Postprocessing

* **New:****Updated Camera Lens Effects

    * The camera lens effect system has been heavily updated.We've streamlined the process of adding particle effects such as water droplets or dirt to the game camera "lens" and it now follows camera motion properly.These features can be used in both C++ code and Blueprints.

    * To use this feature, create a subclass or Blueprint of AEmitterCameraLensEffectBase and configure it as desired.These effects can then be triggered via the PlayerController or PlayerCameraManager, using functions such as APlayerCameraManager::AddCameraLensEffect() or APlayerController::ClientSpawnCameraLensEffect().

* Bugfix:Fixed multiple ScreenSpaceSubusrfaceScattering artifacts

* Bugfix:Fixed a performance regression in the Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

* Bugfix:Fixed blacks of old tonemapper not being black with log space LUT.

* Bugfix:Fixed broken material post process blendable references

* Bugfix:Fixed bug where it was looking for tonemap shader features that don't exist in the PC path.Changed the compiled shader options slightly to reflect common use better.

* Bugfix:Fixed post process materials not supporting view specific material expressions

#### Optimizations

* New:Added reversed index buffers to static meshes to reduce the number of GPU state changes.

    * This is can be enabled/disabled per static mesh in the static mesh editor under "Build Reversed Index Buffer" in the "Build Settings" section.

* New:Improved the texture streaming logic when hierarchical LODs are used.

    * Hierarchical LOD textures are not streamed anymore unless they are visible.

    * Static meshes having hierarchical LODs are not considered by the texture streaming logic when their hierarchical LODs are visible.

    * A transition prefetch distance is configured by the "RangePrefetchDistance" value in the [TextureStreaming] ini section.

* New:LOD dithering now applies a stencil optimization when using a full z-prepass.

* New:Material nodes hooked to multiple inputs (emissive, normal, etc) will now share generated code resulting in less shader instructions

* New:Optimized particle system initialization by caching more information in advance.

* New:'ShowMaterialDrawEvents' now reports triangle counts properly

* New:When using separate translucency, setting r.SeparateTranslucencyScreenPercentage [0;100] can be used to change the resolution of translucency rendering as a percentage of the current rendering resolution.This can be useful to reduce fillrate and bandwidth demand especially for effects heavy situations.

* New:Adding instanced stereo support for the following factory types: terrain, foliage, beams, particle trails and GPU particle sprites.

* New:Adding instanced stereo tessellation support

* Bugfix:Disable instanced stereo rendering when not using a compatible RHI.

* Bugfix:Fixed depth buffer decals when using instanced stereo

* Bugfix:Fixed foliage culling when using instanced stereo.

* Bugfix:Fixed static meshes depth only index buffers not being used with cooked data.

* Bugfix:Fixing bias issue when using dynamic shadows and instanced stereo rendering.

* Bugfix:Fixed Global shaders compiled twice when running a cooker

#### Mobile Rendering

* New:Devices that do support hardware instancing will always use it (most Android devices, all iOS devices)

* New:HQ ES2 Reflections

    * Added mobile material flag to enable high quality reflections.(parallax correction).

    * It selects the nearest 3 reflection captures to the primitive and reflects based on the capture size and type.

* New:'Receive Decals' flag supported on all meshes (previously only for skeletal meshes)

* New:There is now a Project Setting checkbox "Game Discards Unused Material Quality Levels".

    * This allows a Device Profile to select shaders from a particular Quality Level at startup and then free up the memory occupied by shaders for the other quality levels.

    * If the checkbox is not checked, the shader quality level could be changed at runtime by game code, for example by a Settings user interface screen.

* New:Update reflection captures button now works when using the editor in mobile preview mode.

* New:Adreno 420 based devices will use [Android_High] profile

* Bugfix:Fix lighting error in mobile / mobile preview where an object that is fully shadowed from the directional light instead renders as fully lit

    * This only happened if there was _another_ (e.g. point) light causing the object to have a shadowmap

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug in mobile preview mode in which a material texture's alpha channel would be erroneously gamma corrected before use.

* Bugfix:Cases where UMG material was not rendering correctly on mobile devices

* Bugfix:HUD::DrawMaterialSimple does not look correct on Android device when MobileHDR is disabled

* Bugfix:Materials not showing up in HUD on mobile

* Bugfix:Refraction should not cause rendering artifacts on devices that do not support refraction

* Bugfix:Rendering artifacts specific to Nexus 6 devices

* Bugfix:Static shadows rendering artifacts on Galaxy S6 Android 6.0.1

* Bugfix:Translucent objects disappear if scene has decals or mod shadows enabled

* Bugfix:Uniform binding logic for OpenGL, now it correctly handles situations when uniform array was optimized away in a linked program.This was causing various rendering issues on Android 6.x devices.

* Bugfix:Widget 3D Component is not rendering on specific Android devices

* Bugfix:When updating reflection captures, the editor now waits for any outstanding shader compilation to complete.This issue was causing black reflection captures on mobile in some circumstances.

### UI

* New:Added visual editing of analytics provider settings inside the project settings

* New:Converted the Slate text layout to use shaped text

    * The Slate text layout is now aware of bi-directional text.Each hard-line (paragraph) within a document will calculate its base flow direction, and then each run within that line will be broken at flow direction boundaries before being converted into blocks for the text layout to shape and draw.

    * The base flow direction is used to adjust the logical justification of the text, so that when dealing with right-to-left text, a "left" justification will be transformed into a "right" justification and vice versa.The base flow direction is also used when splitting the text for a line into its directional blocks, as it may affect where some characters are placed, such as brackets and quotes.

    * The default text shaping method (see ETextShapingMethod) is Auto, as this will always produce the correct result regardless of the text being shaped.You can override this default using the "Slate.DefaultTextShapingMethod" CVar, and you can also override the shaping method per-widget (for example, if you had widget that you knew would only contain numbers, you could set the shaping method to KerningOnly to avoid any bi-directional detection over

    * The default flow detection method (see ETextFlowDirection) is Auto, as this will always produce the natural result for the text in question.You can override this default using the "Slate.DefaultTextFlowDirection" CVar, and you can also override the flow detection method per-widget.

* Bugfix:After closing the console, keyboard focus will now be restored automatically to the widget that had focus when the console was opened.

* Bugfix:Changed the font used when a font is missing or invalid to be the last resort font, rather than the localized fallback font

    * The localized fallback font could cause different results based on your culture, and the last resort font makes it clearer that something is set-up incorrectly as it just draws invalid glyph markers for all of the text.

* Bugfix:Creating a menu anchor with a MenuLeft placement now works properly, in both UMG and native Slate

* Bugfix:Fix a crash in widget blueprint animation which would occur when starting a new animation in response to another animation ending.

* Bugfix:Fix placement of widgets spawned from a MenuLeft Menu Anchor

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when deleting a font in the font editor

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash while editing a font in the editor with no TTF/OTF file set

* Bugfix:Fixed a font cache crash when using a 3D widget

* Bugfix:Fixed an infinite loop when using Ctrl+Up/Down in a multi-line editable text

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where floating windows were having their border size added again and again, causing them to grow in size with each subsequent editor launch.

    * Allowed PIE windows to not respect work area bounds if they are created centered, so that they can overlap off the edge of the screen (to give the impression of a fullscreen window).

* Bugfix:Fixed crash in UObject::SetLinker after loading some circularly dependent UMG assets

* Bugfix:Fixed some kerning issues when scaling text

    * We now handle scaling the kerning ourself, as FreeType scaling didn't work correctly for all fonts

* Bugfix:Loading movies can now be skipped via gamepad button press.

* Bugfix:Fixed STextBlock not passing through the reply of the double-click handler

* Bugfix:When SWindows are constructed with an auto center rule in place, their size will now be automatically clamped to not be bigger than the preferred work area.This prevents partially offscreen windows from being created.

#### Slate

* New:Added custom UV support to Slate vertex shaders

* New:Added different scroll descendant behavior for scrolling into view, or to the top of the scrollable area

* New:SListView objects now handles gamepad directional up/down and left analog up/down for scrolling.

* New:Table Row expander arrow brush is now customizable

* New:Updates to the PS4 virtual cursor

    * Cannot leave the bounds of the screen

    * No longer spams MouseDown events while a face button is pressed on a controller.On press = one mouse down (just like a mouse!)

    * In "Game and UI" input mode with cursor hiding during capture enabled, the cursor does not move during capture.This prevents an issue where the hidden cursor was still bound to the edges of the screen and restricted the possible movement during capture.

* Bugfix:Substantial progress has been made in hardening Slate.Lots of problems related to memory lifetime/strange crashes have been fixed.This was especially problematic on platforms using a separate RHI Thread.

* Bugfix:Fixing a long standing issue with the 3D Slate Renderer.It was conditionally flushing the font cache which in the case that it needed updating was causing it to corrupt the frame that was actively being rendered and needed the cache to still be alive.The primary renderer is now the only one who should be conditionally flushing the cache.This crash normally reproduced by crashing inside of ​FSlateRHIRenderingPolicy::DrawElements(), trying to access the memory of a now bogus shader resource that was previously the shader resource of the font cache.

* Bugfix:Double-click when the mouse captor has capture is now treated as a normal mouse button down event (prevents the double click event falling through to other widgets)

* Bugfix:Ensured that Engine/Runtime modules don't depend on SlateReflector in a shipping build

* Bugfix:Fix for scrollbox not updating when jumping to a descendant widget

* Bugfix:SButton::SetButtonStyle now updates hovered and pressed sounds.These sounds can be dynamically changed from a Blueprint by simply switching the button's style.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash that could occur when flushing the font cache when drawing the main window element.

* Bugfix:Fixed a memory leak in shaped text

* Bugfix:Fixed bug where Slate Button didn't use it's disabled brush when disabled by hierarchy.

* Bugfix:Fixed memory leak in Slate Renderer that can occur when a batch contains no vertex or index data.

* Bugfix:Fixed problem with menus not closing when clicking in another window on Mac.

* Bugfix:Resetting a slate brush image size will now correctly reset to the image size and not to the default slate size (32x32).

* Bugfix:Fixing several issues involving multi-touch.Data stored involving widgets under cursor are now bucketed based on user and cursor index so that multiple pointer devices, as well as index can independently hold separate widget under cursor data.

* Bugfix:In an editable text box, the caret position is now updated in the next tick if the text was changed via virtual keyboard input.

* Bugfix:Mac OS X:Fixed a potential crash when closing windows

* Bugfix:Manually closing an SMenuAnchor will properly flag it as having been closed that frame

* Bugfix:SProgressBar marquee can now be tinted and accounts for widget color and opacity.

* Bugfix:Supersearch no longer displays the previous set of results if no results for the current search are found.

* Bugfix:The visibility of the SMenuContentWrapper that surrounds SMenuAnchor content is now set to match the visibility of the content

* Bugfix:Custom Draw elements no longer are attempted to be early clipped using the known scissor rect before going through the element batcher, since their clip rect info isn't valid we just ignore doing this step for those elements.

* Bugfix:Improving the way we track references to materials in slate to better keep things alive until they're no longer needed for rendering.Additionally, making it so the we use the material and texture free list when possible when cleaning up things as to not allocate new memory if not required.Coincidentally this can help with problems with corrupted memory on destruct as well, because it means the memory isn't really going to become garbage any more.

* Bugfix:Viewports can now use both pre-multiplied and non-pre-multiplied alpha blending

    * SViewport now has an PreMultipliedAlpha argument (default true), which can control whether to use pre-multiplied alpha when blending is enabled (blending is disabled by default).

    * Note:This is a change in behavior from 4.10, as non-pre-multiplied alpha blending used to be the default.

#### UMG

* New:Invalidation Box Widget - Allows child widgets to be cached and not be pre-passed, ticked or painted.

    * The Invalidation Box has been further enhanced from the one that went out in 4.10.The newest version now caches the vertex and index buffers for the children widgets, so it can execute the draw calls directly instead of rebatching the element list every frame.

* New:Retainer Box Widget - Renders child widgets to an offscreen render target.

    * Some UI can be updated at a lower rate than the rest of the game.You may for example, only want the HUD to redraw at 20Hz to increase performance.The Retainer Box by rendering the widgets offscreen can present them every frame, but only update them at both a specific Frequency, and Phase.To allow you to load balance when they redraw as well.

    * Bonus feature unrelated to performance is that because the children are rendered to an offscreen render target, you can use a material on the Retainer Box that can run shader code on the resulting retained buffer.Which you could use to add some simple post process effects to the children.

* New:Added "Go to Variable" functionality for widgets in Widget Blueprint Editor.

    * When switching modes from Designer to Graph.The widget variable is automatically selected, if one exists.

* New:Added a function to convert slot to border slot.

* New:Added basic controller support for Checkbox, Slider, and ComboBox

    * Checkbox - Can now be toggled using the controller's bottom face button.

    * Slider - The controller's bottom face button must be pressed to begin manipulating the value.The value can be manipulated by using the controller's directional arrows ( This is relative to slider orientation ).Finally, press the face button to navigate away.

    * Combo box - The controller's bottom face button can be used to open the menu.Directional arrows can be used to navigate options before using the face button to accept the value.

* New:Added Blueprint callable functions for setting Slider handle and bar colors.

* New:Added individual start/finish delegates to widget animations.Note that stopping a playing animation will trigger OnFinished while pausing the animation will not.

* New:Added support for vertex shaders in UI materials.

* New:Adding a few extra scaling modes to the scale box, allowing it to Scale to Fit X, and Scale to Fix Y.

* New:Adding a new option to the "Replace With..." menu that offers up, replace with your child widget.So if you're a widget with a single child, you can delete yourself from the hierarchy and promote your children up.

* New:UserWidgets now have a Padding property for their content.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash that occurred when opening Widget Blueprint Editor if 'Animation' and 'Timeline' windows had been previously hidden.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash when dragging widgets out of Switchers in the UMG designer.

    * Fixed unsafe active widget index in SWidgetSwitcher that could act as out-of-bounds index into child array.

* Bugfix:Fixed drag-drop to and from named slots in the UMG widget hierarchy view.

* Fixed incorrect brightness for UMG Image widgets on mobile devices when the widget used both a texture and modified its color value.

* Bugfix:Fixed linker load warnings about WidgetTree outers in cooked builds (of the form Failed to load Outer for resource 'WidgetTree':WidgetBlueprint /Script/UMGEditor.Default__WidgetBlueprint)

* Bugfix:Fixed UMG compiler errors caused by changes to widget blueprints of nested child widgets.

* Bugfix:Fixed UMG editor allowing invalid object names when renaming widgets.

    * Having a period in the name of a widget would cause the editor to crash after copying and pasting.

* Bugfix:Slider value has been clamped to [0,1] to prevent the handle from sliding off the bar.

* Bugfix:UScrollBox's ScrollWidgetIntoView no longer crashes if you pass it a null widget.

* Bugfix:Renaming a widget in the designer is now reflected in the sequencer view.

* Bugfix:AddToPlayerScreen now properly respects any Aspect Ratio lock you currently have on the camera, so that it does not cover the black bars.

* Bugfix:When the Widget Component's Blend Mode is set to Masked, it now correctly makes itself relevant to the opaque pass so that it draws into the velocity buffer to prevent TxAA from blurring it.

* Bugfix:Fixed ScaleBox not reporting its relative layout scale correctly, and making it better at laying out text by doing another prepass after calculating the newest scale.Does add additional overhead for using the scalebox but ensures the proper result.

* Bugfix:We now properly synchronize the Layer property to the grid slot when it's changed.

* Bugfix:Attempting to parent multiple widgets (in Hierarchy tree) to a widget that can't have multiple children will notify the user and ignore the operation, rather than crashing.

* Bugfix:Now clearing the AllWidgets array on UWidgetTree after load.This should fix the issue with widgets removed at runtime not being garbage collected.

* Bugfix:Slate Brushes now properly pay attention to the Filter option on the UTexture you use.

* Bugfix:Fixing the Left menu anchor position to offset the correct amount.

* Bugfix:Slider Locked/HandleIndent properties are now respected.

* Bugfix:DrawTextFormatted is now correctly static.

* Bugfix:The WidgetComponent will now correctly hit test once again.

* Bugfix:Fixing placement of hint text in a TextBox when scaled, also multiply HintText's Color by the incoming widget tint, so that it's properly alpha blended if the parent's alpha is modified.

* Bugfix:Mostly fixing the notorious problem in UMG when modifying a dependent widget, and it causing cascading compile failures across all widgets that use it - forcing you to recompile them all manually.The new compiler code ensures we use the latest class before generating the variable list.

* Bugfix:Fixing the animation stopping code to permit a restart of the same animation on end.If it's played again, we don't add it to the stopped pool.

* Bugfix:The widget component now creates the correct collision volume and bounds for any pivot it is given, this fixes some of the strange hit testing issues.Fixing collision and bounds rendering in the editor to correctly render for multiple views and collision visualization now also renders, previously it never showed if you enabled the flag in the editor.

* Bugfix:Making it more obvious what keys do special stuff with anchors in UMG.Fixing the way snapping to anchors works with Control, it now only zeros out the side you're dragging instead of the entire widget, which was silly.Enhancing the designer message system to no longer be based on an enum and instead let arbitrary systems push and pop FText messages.Fixing animations in the anchor drop down to properly animate, broke when we introduced active timers.

* Performance:If the user does not implement Tick / OnPaint, we now note that in the generated class and configure some flags on the instance to not attempt to ever tick or paint if those were not implemented.

* Added missing resource cleanup code to UMG widgets (ListView, TileView and Slider).

* Attempting to parent multiple widgets (in Hierarchy tree) will no longer crash if parent can only accept fewer child widgets.

* Border widget now correctly updates padding properties.

* DrawLines, DrawFormattedText added to the set of low level painting methods for UMG.

* Relaxed the naming restrictions placed on UMG widgets in the hierarchy by adding a DisplayLabel to UWidgets for editor-friendly naming

* Removed unnecessary check for cleaning up resources when a widget component is about to be destroyed

* The cursor property on widgets now works as it should.You can also call SetCursor and ResetCursor to set it at runtime on any UWidget, or clear your overridden cursor.

* Correctly setting the affected buttons in touch pointer events, restoring input for checkbox/slider on iOS that were only checking the EffectingButton.

* UserWidgets are no longer Focusable by default.Existing UserWidgets should be unaffected.

* New:An alternative way of gathering neighbours of a given navmesh poly has been added.

    * The new way is more efficient and returns a set of NavPolyRefs, as opposed to the older version that was fetching portals.

* New:An alternative way to batch point projections to navmesh has been added.This new way supports declaring custom query boxes per batched point.

* New:ARecastNavMesh::OnNavMeshGenerationFinished has been made virtual to make it easier for game-specific navmesh classes to react to navmesh generation completion.

* New:FNavAgentProperties member variable has been added to FPathFindingQuery and is now being reused in pathfinding code instead of previously used blank, locally created FNavAgentProperties instance.

* New:Moved navigation flags from PrimitiveComponent to ActorComponent for simplicity and to avoid some casting

* New:Unnecessary AI navigation-related headers has been removed from Engine.h.

* A bug resulting in NavigationSystem dynamically spawning NavigationData instances, even if game is not configured for runtime navmesh generation, has been fixed.

* Bugfix:Fixed MovingAgent cleanup in NavLinkCustomComponent.

* FNavigationQueryFilter has been made thread-safe.

* NavigationData's cleanup has been fixed to work reliably both when destroyed and when the game ends.

### Animation

* New:Added a stat for the specific component in the parallel evaluation worker thread, improving the quality of stat captures or named event captures

* New:Added buckets to use for update rate optimizations when configuring native parameters so it can be used over a number of mesh categories without stalling important meshes.

* New:Marked AnimNotify_PlayParticleEffect and AnimNotify_PlaySound as MinimalAPI, so they can be cast to outside of the Engine module

* New:UAnimNotifyState_Trail cam now be overriden by native classes as well as blueprint classes.

* Bugfix:Fixed uninitialized variable in FAnimUpdateRateParameters (OptimizeMode now defaults to TrailMode)

* Removed a bogus unguarded dereference of GetWorld() from USkinnedMeshComponent::GetSkeletalMeshResource(), preventing a crash when working with an unregistered component

* New:Moved some automation tests into separate test files their respective modules.

* Refactored Async tests; added validation to Void Task test.

* Removed dead UDPMessageSegmenter test

### Blueprints

* New:USCS_Node::ChildNodes is now a private member.Manipulation must be performed via accessor functions.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug that caused instanced properties to be cleared on Blueprint compile.

* Made a load warning when a node class is missing more actionable by including the package name in the log output

* Reduced the number of memory allocations done when managing latent actions, and added a stat tracking the time spent in ProcessLatentActions

* Spline Component Get Segment Length now correctly takes into account the world scale of the component.Also exposed UpdateSpline to Blueprints so that the spline can be updated in code after applying a new scale transform.

* UObject::execLocalVariable will no longer crash when there is a type mismatch

#### Core

* New:Added FastDecimalFormat to provide efficient and culture aware number formatting

* New:Added FindSortedStringCaseInsensitive overload which takes an array type.

* New:Added FPackageName::TryConvertLongPackageNameToFilename

    * This allows you to attempt convert a package name (or path) into a filename (or path) without generating an assert.FPackageName::LongPackageNameToFilename now calls this function and asserts on failure.

* New:Added functions to access low-level file stat data as a single file-system request

    * You can now use GetStatData to get all of the stat data for a file (its timestamps, size, read-only state, and type (file or directory)) in a single file-system request

        * Depending on the platform, this can be much more efficient than making multiple requests

    * This change also adds alternate directory iteration functions (IterateDirectoryStat and IterateDirectoryStatRecursive) for when you need the stat data along with the files/directories on disk

        * For platforms that provide this stat data as part of the low-level directory iteration (such as Windows), this can yield much better performance than making two separate file-system requests

        * Platforms that do not provide this information as part of the directory iteration will just perform a stat request while iterating

* New:Added inline allocator support to TFunction.

* New:Added intrinsic support for FMath::CountLeadingZeros and FMath::CountTrailingZeros on Clang platforms.

* New:Added IsAligned function for testing a pointer's alignment.

* New:Added IsValidLowLevel checks to root set objects when initializing Garbage Collector.

* New:Added macro "logOrEnsureNanError" which either logs an error or triggers an ensure, depending on the value of GEnsureOnNANDiagnostic.

    * CVar "EnsureOnNaNFail" can be used to control this behavior.

* New:Added specific FMath rounding implementations:

    * FMath::RoundHalfToEven

    * FMath::RoundHalfFromZero

    * FMath::RoundHalfToZero

    * FMath::RoundFromZero

    * FMath::RoundToZero

    * FMath::RoundToNegativeInfinity

    * FMath::RoundToPositiveInfinity

* New:Added write flags support to FFileHelper::SaveArrayToFile and FFileHelper::SaveStringToFile.

* New:Allow development command line options -execcmds, -exec, -vsync, and -novsync to work in Test configuration builds (still disabled in Shipping configuration builds)

* New:Allow memreport to work in Test configuration without requiring UEBuildConfiguration.bUseLoggingInShipping to be true

    * Note:It still requires ALLOW_DEBUG_FILES, and is disabled in the true Shipping configuration

    * Added a new FOutputDeviceArchiveWrapper which doesn't try to do any special work and merely adapts the FOutputDevice API to write to a FArchive

    * Switched UEngine::HandleMemReportDeferredCommand over to use FOutputDeviceArchiveWrapper

* New:Basic support for dynamic UClasses (UClasses that don't need to be constructed at runtime, and can be later removed).Native blueprint support for UnrealHeaderTool.

* New:Blueprint Generated Class references can now be redirected to Native Class references.

* New:CrashReporter - Added a safer method for adding new crashes to the database, should no longer time-out

* New:CrashReporter - Added initial support for the unified crash context

* New:De-templatizied GetPrivateStaticClassBody to help improve compile times.

* New:Engine:Added build configuration (e.g., Development, Test, or Shipping) to the output .log generated for fpscharts

* New:Fixed UHT parsing of PRAGMA_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS and PRAGMA_ENABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS macros.

* New:FReferenceCollector::AddReferenceObjects performance improvements for TArrays

    * AddReferncedObjects will no longer call HandleObjectReference multiple times but instead will call HandleObjectReferences just once (currently only implemented for FGCCollector).Reduces the number of virtual function calls while collecting garbage.

* New:Garbage Collection and WeakObjectPtr optimizations

    * Moved some of the EObjectFlags to EInternalObjectFlags and merged them with FUObjectArray

    * Moved WeakObjectPtr serial numbers to FUObjectArray

    * Added pre-allocated UObject array

* New:Improved "obj list" formatting to make it easier to work with

    * Removed meaningless 'ResourceKB' number (it is never actionable due to double-counting, etc...); ExclusiveResKB is still present and useful

    * Changed all sizes to be float KB instead of int KB (10.2f)

    * Added commas between entries and dropped the K suffixes, to make it easier to import into other software

* New:Initial implementation of makefiles for UnrealHeaderTool - designed to improve programmer iteration times.

* New:Introduced GC UObject clusters.GC clusters provide means to create disregard for garbage collector subsets at load time (e.g. Materials with material expressions and their textures).

* New:LoadClass now provides the same default arguments as LoadObject

* New:Made delegates' Create functions throw a warning when their return value is ignored.

* New:Merged FTlsObjectInitializers with FUObjectThreadcontext to avoid excessive thread local storage lookups when creating UObjects.

* New:Added FVector::DistSquaredXY helper function

* New:Replaced GetUObjectArray() function calls with GUObjectArray object to avoid redundant function calls in performance sensitive places.

* New:Replaced the checks of duplicate bindings in multicast delegates with ensures.

* New:Tick functions can now have a different start and end group

* New:Turn on async component tick by default.This means any tick function marked as being able to run on any thread will actually do so by default

* New:UnfocusedVolumeMultiplier can now be set programmatically.

* New:UnrealBuildTool:Exposed the ability to disable /largeaddressaware for Win32 compiles (bBuildLargeAddressAwareBinary)

* Bugfix:Fix for implementation of FWindowsPlatformMisc::Is64bitOperatingSystem() which was always returning true.

* Bugfix:Fixed Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 and Visual Studio 2015 debug visualizers.

* Added an API macro to UMaterialExpressionObjectOrientation.

* Added overload for FMath::RandRange() that takes two floats.Using floats with the int32 version is most often a mistake so this makes the behavior explicit.

* Better detection of hot-reload-from-IDE builds.

* Changed a failure to set a cvar due to a previous set via system settings ini to be displayed as Display instead of Warning

    * Rationale:There is no way in a game to prevent the project settings or scalability from trying to set the value and failing with the message, and a user had to go out of their way to add one and intended them to exist (there's no UI way to set them in this manner in the editor)

* Deprecated FDelegateBase::GetDelegateInstance.This was an internal API that was never intended to be exposed.

* Disabled Hot-Reload functionality in game builds.

* FArchiveReplaceObjectRef will now respect references added through AddReferencedObjects

* FDefferedMessageLog class will now be more thread safe

* ForEachObjectWithOuter now correctly considers children of excluded objects for being operated on.

* [UObjectGlobals] Do not overwrite instanced subobjects with ones from CDO

* Linkers will no longer be reset when renaming objects while post loading blueprints.

* Lowered the priority of task graph threads and added the ability to control this with a console command for testing.

* Made a serialization error about enums more actionable by including the name of the asset being loaded (if there is one)

* Made FCriticalSection non-copyable.

* Made FMath::IsPowerOfTwo a template to allow it to take any integral type.

* Modified GetParamValueIfNotSpecified to return Default value if the param is not part of the command line

* Optimization:Improved FWeakObjectPtr::Get() performance.

    * Inlined some internal functions that were not being inlined.Removed some branches, especially in the common case when bEvenIfPendingKill=false.

* Fix "error:'&' within '|'" in EditorPerformanceTests.cpp when using clang-3.5.2 

* Fixed LogCompile typo:Tabify time was was... 

* Prevented FPaths::MakeStandardFilename from crashing when passed a 1 character string

* Refactored FMallocBinned.

* Removed copies of FD3D12PipelineStateCache now that FCriticalSection is uncopyable.

* Removed deprecated CanConvertPointerFromTo metafunction.

* Removed DiskCachedAssetDataBuffer as it was not strictly necessary and was triggering a crash when loading the cached registry from disk.This data is now stored directly in DiskCachedAssetDataMap.It was already true that this map does not change outside of SerializeCache but now it is critical since NewCachedAssetDataMap keeps pointers directly to its values.

* Removed FNameLookupCPPArchiveProxy as it was not used by anything

* Removed redundant memory allocation when loading empty files in FFileHelper::LoadFileToString.

* Removed unnecessary memory allocations from TMultiMap::MultiFind.

* Removed unnecessary zero-byte allocations from BulkData.

* Removed unused FUntypedBulkData::GetBulkDataResourceMemory and FUntypedBulkData::ShouldFreeOnEmpty functions.

* Replaced some -1s with INDEX_NONEs.

* Stopped FName instances with the same string but different numerical suffixes all getting the same hash

* UnrealHeaderTool:Fixed a bug where some kinds of shadowing would not generate an error (e.g., struct member shadowing), and one where thrown errors would not return a failure code stopping the build

* When cooking by the book, imports that should be excluded from packages for specific targets (i.e. NotForServer imports should not be created for the server cook target) will no longer be created.

* Wrapped all vector library calls to math functions through our FMath versions, so they benefit from fixes or improvements therein.Added Exp2() function.

#### Editor and Tools

* New:Added a complete framework to allow plugins to add their own editor build steps.

    * These can be executed individually (e.g. by selecting an entry in the Build drop down menu), and in the Build All action.

    * Build actions can be registered to run at any point during Build All, except after Lightmass, as Lightmass never calls back to the editor build system to say it's complete.

    * Builds can be asynchronous, like Lightmass, and the system handles continuing Build All after this is complete.

* New:Added option to display installed platform options even if they are not valid for the current project type

    * This is used to show the option to package code projects in the editor, so that it can display a message about it not being available

* New:Added support for OrthoFreelook viewport types when calculating the view rotation matrix for the viewport.

* New:Better display support for Arrays of structs within UDataAssets

    * Added support for optional meta=(TitleProperty="StructPropertyNameHere") tag on properties of type TArray<FSomeStruct>

    * This changes the editor rolled-up display of these values from "{0} members" to a stringified version of the specified property (if found) making it easier to identify the element you want to work with.

    * For example, if your struct has a UPROPERTY called Name you can set that as the TitleProperty to use it as the row summary.

* New:Moved component visualizer headers to the Public folder to allow their use as base classes in project code.Also moved some spline visualizer members from private to protected scope and DLL exported the necessary symbols.

* New:Refactored the way that property keying works in sequencer based tools.Any sequencer code for custom property tracks in either the widget blueprint animation editor or the level sequence editor will need to be updated.This allowed deleting a lot of duplicated complex key behavior code.No data changes are required.

* New:Removed the limitation that BSP must be rebuilt during a transaction.

* New:Slow Task dialogs can now be set to automatically open only after a certain amount of time has passed.

    * This can be useful if it's not necessarily known in advance how long a task will take, but where opening the dialog for only a second or so would be disruptive.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash bug in FEditorFileUtils::AddCheckoutPackageItems when no OutPackagesNotNeedingCheckout array is specified.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug that was causing TAssetPtrs to point to the wrong objects during play-in-editor sessions.

* Memory Profiler:Optimized FillActiveCallStackList to avoid frequent reallocations, significantly improving overall token stream parse speed

* Prevented ResaveContent commandlet from resaving all content when passed a PACKAGEFOLDER= directory that contains no assets (it now gracefully exits since there is no work to do)

* Exposing an extenders list for the Play menu in the level editor toolbar for extension.

##### Content Browser

* New:Added a way to handle user-defined drag-drop operations in the SAssetView

    * You can now use FContentBrowserModule::GetAssetViewDragAndDropExtenders to register callbacks that are used by SAssetView to handle custom drag-drop operators.

    * Note:These callbacks are only called if the operation isn't handled by SAssetView itself.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash caused by accessing an invalid string when using the PathChangedDelegate callback

* Bugfix:Fixed the back/forward buttons in the Content Browser not triggering the PathChangedDelegate

#### Gameplay Framework

* New:Addded a method IsLooping to determine whether an AEmiterCameraLensEffectBase object will loop forever

* New:Added FScopedPreventAttachedComponentMove scoping construct which temporarily sets a SceneComponent to use absolute location/rotation/scale to prevent moving when attached to a parent that moves.The flags are then restored after the scope goes away.

    * ComponentToWorld of the child will not change when the parent moves (it shouldn't since it stays at the same location).RelativeLocation, RelativeRotation, and RelativeScale3D will be set to match the absolute flags, which are restored after the scope goes out of context.

    * Optimized SceneComponent::UpdateChildTransforms to do nothing when the child uses all absolute flags.

    * Relocated bWorldToComponentUpdated and bAbsoluteTranslation_DEPRECATED for better cache behavior.

* New:Added SceneComponent::IsQueryCollisionEnabled() and IsPhysicsCollisionEnabled(), since IsCollisionEnabled() is more general than we often want.

    * MoveComponent now only sweeps if query collision is enabled (not just any collision, so now excludes PhysicsOnly collision).

    * UpdateOverlaps now only generates overlaps if query collision is enabled (not just any collision, so now excludes PhysicsOnly collision).

    * A few other locations were changed to only consider query collision, where it didn't make sense to include PhysicsOnly collision.

* New:Added a delegate that can be bound to trigger when a hitch is detected while doing FPSCharts (	UEngine::OnHitchDetectedDelegate)

* New:Added console commands to list components/actors with a given response to any specified profile, and to list profiles with a given response to any specified collision channel.This processes only those assets which have been loaded in to memory so far.New commands are:

    * New commands are listed below."Response" is one of:Ignore, Overlap, Block."Profile" is either an index or name from the ListProfiles command."Channel" is either an index or name from the ListChannels command.

    * Collision.ListProfiles

    * Collision.ListChannels

    * Collision.ListComponentsWithResponseToProfile <Response> <Profile>

    * Collision.ListProfilesWithResponseToChannel <Response> <Channel>

* New:Added FQuat methods GetForwardVector(), GetRightVector(), GetUpVector().Improve comments for GetAxis[X|Y|Z] and GetRotationAxis().

* New:Added IsLooping() to UCameraShake to indicate when it will loop forever

* New:Added Pawn::IsPlayerControlled() to compliment IsLocallyControlled() (thanks EverNewJoy!)

* New:AnimNotifies for trail effects can recycle ParticleSystemComponents, to avoid spawning them each time and avoid the template setup cost.This is enabled by default.

    * Trails are not limited to PSCs spawned by the trails (though those are preferred), so a persistent effect can be spawned for an actor and reused forever.

    * Optimized some internal functions to avoid dynamic memory allocations.Optimized editor code for trails to avoid creating FText for every update.

* New:Exposed more control over CharacterMovement network smoothing options.

    * Exposed CharacterMovement network smoothing options in new enum ENetworkSmoothingMode.

    * Exposed more tunable parameters to network smoothing.

    * Refactored SmoothClientPosition() to use two helper functions SmoothClientPosition_Interpolate and SmoothClientPosition_UpdateVisuals.

        * This allows custom code to selectively only update interpolation values and not push transform updates if they use custom throttling or culling code.

* New:Fixed multiple bugs related to creating more than one UWorld within one game engine instance.

    * Using multiple UWorlds with UGameEngine is still very experimental, and your mileage may vary.

* New:Gameplay Abilities:Added the ability to flag a pin as requiring a connection on a latent ability call (meta=(RequiresConnection="true") on the delegate property)

* New:Improved and optimized FQuat::FindBetween() and add some Vector->Orientation functions that include Quat results.

    * Added FindBetweenNormals() and FindBetweenVectors() to indicate different input length requirements.Old FindBetween() previously assumed normalized input, new one does not, but is still faster.

    * Converted most uses of FQuat::FindBetween to FQuat::FindBetweenNormals where the inputs are known to be normalized.

    * Added FVector::ToOrientationQuat.This preserves the up vector (result has no roll).

    * Added FVector::ToOrientationRotator, matching FVector::Rotation implementation.

* New:New virtual function added to AController to GetMinRespawnDelay

* New:Significance Manager is an experimental plugin that provides a framework to help manage the significance of objects based on user view location(s) and based on that significance make decisions about LOD, tick frequency, whether effects should be spawned, sounds played, and other performance related decisions.

* New:Spawning an actor will now respect any default transform on a native root component.

* New:Split UCharacterMovementComponent::VerifyClientTimeStamp to have "checking" logic in a new IsClientTimeStampValid (const) function and have non-const ServerData.CurrentClientTimeStamp reset within the Verify function so that external code can check client timestamp validity without side-effects (also moved logging)

    * Moved UCharacterMovementComponent::PackYawAndPitchTo32 to a static function in header to be able to be accessed outside of CharacterMovementComponent.cpp (for project-specific child classes)

* New:Systems can now register with AHUD::OnShowDebugInfo to provide additional showdebug categories and details.

* New:There is now an override of UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation that takes a transform rather than separate rotation and location.

* New:UActorComponent::OnComponentDestroyed now takes a boolean parameter that indicates whether the entire Actor that owns the component is being destroyed at once or if the component is being destroyed independently.

    * This can be used to avoid expensive operations like individually detaching scene components for an entire hierarchy that is being destroyed at once.

* New:You can now bind double "click" events for touch inputs.

* Bugfix:Fixed rare crash in AGameplayAbilityTargetActor that occurred with an invalid OwningAbility.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash in GetPlayerControllerFromNetId if the player state's unique ID is not valid.

* Bugfix:Fixed UCharacterMovementComponent::ApplyRepulsionForce() using the overlap body index incorrectly.Fixes pushing wrong bodies on skeletal mesh components with multi-body overlap enabled.

* Bugfix:Fixed ensure triggering in PIE/editor shutdown cases with AGameplayAbilityTargetActor:Only attempt to unbind confirm/cancel callbacks if we bound them succesfully in the first place

* Bugfix:Fixed non-normalized Quats from character network smoothing causing NaN errors.

* Bugfix:Fixed UAbilitySystemComponents always ticking even if they don't need to

* Bugfix:Fixed UGameplayCueManager handling GameplayCues when world is tearing down (especially during PIE exit) - safety check

* Bugfix:Fixed up uses of library math functions to go through our FMath namespace so they benefit from fixes or improvements.

* Bugfix:Fixed UPrimitiveComponent::GetCollisionShape not correctly enforcing bounds limits to reject negative sizes when inflation is used.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug in FInterpCurve::InaccurateFindNearestOnSegment where it wasn't finding nearest points on the closing segment of a looped spline.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug where UGameplayAbility::SetShouldBlockOtherAbilities() could run on an ability that is no longer active

* Bugfix:Fixed bug with optimized MarkActorComponentForNeededEndOfFrameUpdate.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash in CheckStillInWorld after Actor has been destroyed or is not in the world.

* Bugfix:Fixed excessive allocation in gameplaytags and gameplayeffects subsystems.

* Bugfix:Fixed linear searches of component updates.

* Bugfix:Fixed OnComponentCreated not always being called before RegisterComponent().

* Bugfix:Fixed possible crash in Particles by checking for nullptr

* Bugfix:Fixed replicated transforms not being updated on clients until the next transform or replication update.

* Bugfix:Fixed some compiler warnings in FInputActionKeyMapping struct

* Added FCollisionQueryParams::ClearIgnoredComponents and SetNumIgnoredComponents.

* Added check for valid AWorldSettings to UWorld::IsPaused

* Added DestroyActiveState to AbilitySystemComponent so unregistering the component while in-flight abilities are active do not crash.

    * Added option for reusing player states when they become inactive instead of duplicating them via OnDeactivated and OnReactivated methods.

* Added NaN checking to FVector::Rotation and AController::GetControlRotation and make NaN logging in FQuat::Rotator() more verbose.Tweaked FQuat::ToString() to display more precision.

* Changed game thread tasks to be high priority.The renderer is generally more tolerant of task latency so this helps keep things running smoothly.

* Changed the timer manager to be grow-only, avoiding reallocs due to expiring timers, etc...

* Disabled RVO avoidance registration on network clients, and made a note of it only running on the server.It already did not update velocities on clients anyway.

* Disabled ticking by default for ACameraActor as there is no work to be done per-tick (subclasses can still set it)

* Do not crash when PlayerController is given a LocalPlayer in commandlet mode

* Ensure that we pass a valid delta time to UCharacterMovementComponent::CalcRootMotionVelocity()

* FloatingPawnMovement uses faster FQuat code path for movement.

* FMath::Atan2() no longer calls atan2f() because of some compiler or library bugs causing it to randomly return NaN for valid input.

    * It now uses a high-precision minimax approximation instead, measured to be 2x faster than the stock C version.

* GetAttachParentSocketName now returns the correct information.

* Inlined SceneComponent::GetAttachParent() and added GetAttachSocketName().

* Made FQuat::DiagnosticCheckNaN() const and added a call to it in FQuat::Rotator().

* Made FVector::IsUniform() just call AllComponentsEqual(), as the old implementation was similar but allowed 2*Tolerance difference between X and Z.

* Made various FQuat interpolation methods normalize output by default.Added versions that do not normalize if that is desired.

    * Added FQuat::Slerp_NotNormalized() and made current FQuat::Slerp() always normalize output.FQuat::FastLerp() remains unchanged (does not normalize).

    * Added FQuat::SlerpFullPath_NotNormalized() and made current FQuat::SlerpFullPath() always normalize output.

* Moved AttachmentReplication update out of SceneComponent and to ActorReplication.It only needs to be done on the network authority and only for the root component, and replication updates is a better place to check this.

* Network attachment uses less bandwidth when root component is attached and is set to replicate.Actor no longer replicates redundant AttachmentReplication struct in this case.

* Optimization: avoid calling USceneComponent::UpdateChildTransforms() when there are no children.

* Optimization:Inlined ACharacter methods:GetMesh(), GetCharacterMovement(), GetCapsuleComponent(), GetArrowComponent().

* Optimization: reduce calls to GetNetMode() in CharacterMovementComponent.Some cases can be replaced by much simpler net Role checks.

* Optimization: removed the need for APawn to implement Tick().

    * Moved RemoteViewPitch update to Pawn::PreReplication() from Tick().

* Optimization:Stop ticking particle systems on the dedicated server if they are not enabled, rather than bailing out of the tick each time.

* Optimized FCollisionQueryParams::AddIgnoredActor() and AddIgnoredComponents().

* Optimized FDynamicMeshEmitterData::GetParticleTransform() to avoid needless Quat->Rotator and Rotator->Matrix conversions.

* Optimized USceneComponent::CalcNewComponentToWorld() to take a faster path when there is no parent.

* Optimized allocations in UpdatePrimitiveAttachment.

* Optimized character net location update and mesh interpolation to cause fewer transform updates, especially on the mesh.

    * Added Character::bClientCheckEncroachmentOnNetUpdate to control whether we care about checking for encroachment when we get a new network location.

* Optimized character smoothing code to avoid SmoothClientPosition() calls once the target mesh offset has been reached.

    * New flag bNetworkSmoothingComplete indicates whether smoothing has reached the destination.This is set to false when a new network position is received.

    * Also fixes trying to smooth rotation towards identity rotation before receiving network updates.

    * Deprecated FNetworkPredictionData_Client_Character::CurrentSmoothTime in favor of saving last update time, to prevent needing to update time every tick (since we skip updates now).

* Optimized CharacterMovementComponent mesh interpolation on clients to only perform one chain of transform updates when using linear smoothing, rather than separately rotating the capsule and then translating the mesh.

* Optimized component registration to avoid useless DetachFromParent() for the same pending AttachParent during registration.Added missing UpdateOverlaps() when detaching from object simulating physics.

* Optimized FTransform::Equals().

    * Check translation first as it's a simpler test and more likely to differ.

    * Scale3D test is now per-component rather than a dot product test versus tolerance.

* Optimized particle systems to avoid useless detach/attach during registration when bAutoManageAttachment is enabled and the particle system auto-activates.

* Optimized some low level checks used to support Object and Actor networking

    * Optimized UObject::IsNameStableForNetworking() to check cheap flags first before expensive IsDefaultSubObject().

    * Optimized UActorComponent::IsSupportedForNetworking() to check GetIsReplicated() before IsNameStableForNetworking(), and inlined GetIsReplicated().

* Optimized usage of FHitResult during movement, and added functions to better control initialization of the struct.

    * Avoid initializing FHitResult in PrimitiveComponent::MoveComponentImpl when it's not used.

    * Added Init() functions to FHitResult and use them to avoid Construct + Copy in a few places.

    * Added ENoInit constructor for FHitResult.

* Optimized usage of some collision profiles to use existing static FNames rather than names defined at the call sites.

* Optimized VInterpNormalRotationTo() to use faster FQuat::RotateVector() rather than converting to matrix first.

* Projectile uses faster FQuat code path when passing rotation to MoveComponent.

* Remove duplicate AHUD:DrawText function that uses different co-ordinates

* Removed a few allocations from the tick task manager.

* Removed collision from DefaultPhysicsVolume.It doesn't have collision geometry but can show up in global lists of actors with collision enabled.

* Removed misleading/incorrect duplicate signature comments from the FGameDelegates delegate declarations, replacing them with inline parameter names

* Removed some branches from character movement ticks, conditionally call some virtual functions, and add a stat counter to UCharacterMovementComponent::SmoothCorrection.

* Set sensible default parameters for APlayerController::ClientPlayCameraAnim and APlayerController::ClientPlayCameraShake

* Simulated root motion in CharacterMovementComponent uses FScopedMovementUpdate for cheaper movement.

* Smooth Z location during Character simulated mesh interpolation just like all other axes.

* TActorIterator now properly filters out Actors in hidden levels the same as FActorIterator

* UCharacterMovementComponent no longer replicates moves to the server if its character's Player is null, which can be the case if the local player has enabled the debug camera.

    * Prevents "no owning connection" warning spam for ServerMove RPCs.

* Updated async trace handling to accept trace requests more widely.Avoids potential issues when poorly-timed requests would come in.

* UPlayerInput::GetInvertAxisKey and InvertAxisKey fixed to work consistently with Mouse Sensitivity.

* When clearing a PlayerController's spectator pawn, use regular pawn for attachment and auto-managed camera target if regular pawn has already been set up.

#### Localization

* New:Added string formatting methods for internationalization metadata.

* New:Added support for detecting the reading direction of text

    * This uses the ICU BiDi functionality (where available) to detect whether text is left-to-right, right-to-left, or mixed, and in the mixed case, can give you a breakdown of the direction of each sub-section of text.

* Bugfix:Fixed a double FText history allocation in AsNumber, AsPercent, AsCurrency, AsDate, AsTime, AsDateTime, and Format

* Added caching for LOCTEXT

    * Previously, each call to LOCTEXT would create a new FText instance, which involved several allocations and map look-ups.This change aims to allow repeated calls to LOCTEXT to return the same FText instance while also performing zero allocations as part of the look-up.In a synthetic test, this has been shown to yield a 6.5x increase in performance.

    * This has other side effects where LOCTEXT was being used in a Slate attribute, as it means the text layout can perform a fast pointer comparison (which will pass, as both will now point to the same instance), rather than a slower string comparison.

* Blueprint pin property tool tips are no longer gathered for localization unless gathering of editor text is specified.

* FText::AsMemory now takes a uint64 rather than a SIZE_T

    * This allows it to format 64-bit size values in 32-bit builds, which is needed to correctly display file and drive sizes.

* Minimized FText allocations when generating text at runtime

    * Text that is generated at runtime (such as via FText::AsNumber) now allocates its string and history together in a single allocation.

    * Profiling shows that this almost negates the cost of the text history, without having to remove the text history (which is essential for FText serialization).

* Some performance improvements for FText::Format (in Blueprints)

    * FFormatArgumentData now uses an FString (rather than an FText) as its ArgumentName.This avoids the extra cost associated with creating an FText instance.

    * FFormatTextArgument has been replaced with a UHT exposed version of FFormatArgumentData.This avoids an extra array conversion in UKismetTextLibrary::Format when using the format text node in Blueprints.

    * UK2Node_FormatText now stores its pin names (extracted from the format string) as FString rather than FText.

* Some performance improvements for FText::Format.

    * FText::Format which takes an array of FFormatArgumentData no longer converts that into a temporary TMap.

    * FTextFormatHelper::Format no longer allocates an FString for the argument, and instead passes a lightweight FTextFormatHelper::FArgumentName.

#### Networking

* New:Added IsDedicatedServerInstance() to UGameInstance.Returns true if running a dedicated server of any kind (PlayInEditor, Server exe, Editor as Server, etc).

* New:Added "-notimeouts" commandline argument to prevent UNetDriver class from timing out net connections during development.Works with UPartyBeaconHost as well.

* New:Added "PostRepNotifies()" event to Objects, called after any rep notifies may be triggered.

* New:Added a lobby framework entirely using beacons.Supports a similar workflow to the AGameMode/AGameState/APlayerController/APlayerState actors to create a way for clients to connect and interact with a server without being fully committed to loading the server map.

* New:Added an initial implementation of an InMemoryNetworkReplayStreaming module.

    * Unlike NullNetworkReplayStreaming and HttpNetworkReplayStreaming, this implementation doesn't rely on the disk or network, and as a result is generally much faster.

    * It is intended to be used for specific cases where a local, transient replay would be useful.

* New:Added DestroyNetworkActorHandled function to overload special behavior in AActor::DestroyActor.APlayerControllers and UOnlineBeacons will mark the UNetConnection bPendingDestroy so that the actor will timeout and cleanup shortly.

* New:Added new USE_SERVER_PERF_COUNTERS define to enable use of perf counters in networked related code.

* New:Beacon types are set by their UObject class name rather than specified by developers.This will prevent accidental incompatibility with derived child classes.

* New:Moved "use short connection timeout" feature into its own function.This is used by the net driver to determine when to move from UNetDriver::InitialConnectTimeout to UNetDriver::ConnectionTimeout.During normal gameplay this is when APlayerController has been replicated/acknowledged by the client.For beacons, it is when the connection has been opened by the server and the first server Remote Procedure Call (RPC) has been sent.

* New:The NullNetworkReplayStreaming implementation can now play back live games.This is useful for testing with multiple instances of the game running on the same machine.

* New:The replay streamer implementation module to use can now be overridden at runtime.

    * You can pass the name of the module to use into FNetworkReplayStreaming::GetFactory, or you can use the "ReplayStreamerOverride=" URL option.The URL option is useful when combined with the "DemoRec" URL option.

    * If neither of these overrides is provided, the implementation will fall back to the one defined by the "DefaultFactoryName" in the Engine configuration file, as before.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug which caused the incorrect IRepChangedPropertyTracker to be passed to the UActorComponent::PreReplication function during replay recording.The tracker is now correctly looked up in the demo net driver instead of the game net driver.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue that could cause the value of AWorldSettings::WorldGravityZ to not be applied on clients after it changed on the server.

* Client beacons now properly use the "short connection timeout" feature which switches between UNetDriver InitialConnectTimeout and ConnectionTimeout values after the beacon is properly connected to the server.Additionally made sure to set beacon socket state to USOCK_Open at the proper time.

* GetNetMode() now correctly returns NM_DedicatedServer instead of NM_Standalone for Actor's on a dedicated server if the netdriver has been disconnected.

* Improved server log message for a failed RPC when the actor's level isn't ready on a client

* LogNet message "Adding actor NetGUID" verbosity changed to VeryVerbose

* Reduced incremental allocations in FClassNetCacheMgr::GetClassNetCache

#### Online

* New:A join-in-progress user can now be associated to a specific replay by calling the INetworkReplayStreamer::AddUserToReplay function.

* New:Add GetAuthType function to IOnlineIdentity that corresponds to account mapping on MCP (for example PSN accounts use "PSN")

* New:Added a basic URLDecode implementation to the FGenericPlatformHttp class.

* New:Added a new (currently optional) delegate to the end of the Online DestroySession call.This will be the preferred method for programmer initiated asynchronous calls to be checked for completion.Events will still be multicast delegates.A future engine change will include changes for more interfaces.

* New:Added an "run exec command" endpoint to the perfcounter query port."/exec?c=<cmd>" will execute any command."-StatsPort=XXX" will enable this (and explicitly checks for messages from localhost only).

* New:Added generic UrlDecode function for decoding a string that has been URL encoded.

* New:Added GetPartyLeader() function to party beacon class for access to a party leader for a given unique id in an existing party.

* New:Added IsLoaded function to online subsystem utils for determining the availability of specified online subsystem

* New:Added LoadDefaultSubsystem and ReloadDefaultSubsystem functions to OnlineSubsystem (OSS).Used to reset OSS in Play In Editor (PIE) when changing login settings.

* New:Added new accessor function GetGameInstance to OnlineSessionClient class

* New:Added two new session search comparison operators NOT_IN and IN.Expects string of values of the form [value1;value2;value3].Additionally added EXCLUDEUNIQUEIDS to exclude sessions with specific registered users.Format is [userid1;userid2].Neither feature is guaranteed to be supported on all platforms.

* New:BuildPatchServices now has new retry logic for downloads with access to download health information

* New:BuildPatchServices:Ability to remove a custom field from a manifest

* New:BuildPatchServices:Chunk recognition can now verify a match using just SHA1 rather than comparing actual chunk data

* New:BuildPatchServices:Tagged installation support.BuildPatchTool can now take information in the file attributes data that optionally tags certain files with custom keywords.These keywords can be used when creating an installer in order to filter the list of files that will get downloaded and installed.

* New:Custom events can be added to replays!These events contain a group, metadata, and data.The group is used when enumerating events, metadata will eventually be used to filter within a group, and the data contains an extra information relevant to the specific event.See the DemoNetDriver AddEvent and EnumerateEvents functions for more details.

* New:FStructSerializer:Values can be filtered by a predicate to control which properties are serialized

* New:ImageWrapper now uses the file header to auto-detect the image format

* New:OnlineSubsystem session interface DestroySession call now takes a completion delegate parameter that will only fire for that call.This is in addition to any delegates specified in the corresponding AddDelegate call.Future refactor is planned to add this kind of completion delegate to all OnlineSubsystem calls and deprecate the Add/ClearDelegate paradigm where possible.

* New:Speed up online subsystem accessors when not in Development or Play In Editor builds

* New:SWebBrowser:Added support for returning arrays from UFunctions to javascript code running inside browser widgets

* New:The names for the different online subsystems have been moved into their own file, OnlineSubsystemNames.h, so they can be referenced even if their corresponding subsystems aren't being used.

* New:WebBrowser:Allow passing TMap<FString,T> as arguments to FWebBrowserJSFunction objects

* New:WebBrowser:Functions exposed to JavaScript can now take a FWebJSResponse argument for passing results to the caller on the JS side.Allowing for raising error conditions and implementing asynchronous results.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug that would prevent HTTP retries from working.TimeSinceLastResponse was not getting reset with ElapsedTime so once a request timed out it would always time out N more times until the retry sys gives up

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash that could occur in OnlineSubsystemNull's implementation of the IOnlineSession::CancelFindSessions() function.

* Bugfix:Fixed a possible string buffer overflow issue in Steam matchmaking code when processing advertised keys.

* Bugfix:Fixed many crashes and inefficiencies with the party system that occur after the online subsystem enters a disconnected state.

* Bugfix:Fixed party framework to make sure that only one UObject for a party member is created between "joined" and "data received" delegates firing.Fixes possible race condition that would create two instead.

* Bugfix:Fixed possible buffer overflow issue in Steam implementation when using FCString::Strcpy (replaced with FCString::Strncpy)

* Bugfix:Fixed SWebBrowserView destructor to unbind its own delegate handlers and not event handlers owned by other objects

* BuildPatchServices:Download code for file protocols now use Thread Pool to load the files rather than one at a time.

* Moved all platform http headers into the http module and out of core.Wasn't possible to export any of the platform implementations because of the improper mix of CORE_API and HTTP_API declarations.

* Online subsystem delegate handles are cleared with passed to any of the clear delegate functions.

* Online subsystem delegate handles are now invalidated inside the ClearX_Handle calls.

* Party framework added a new error code for UnknownParty and properly uses it in the various API callbacks.

* test bResult instead of bSucceeded in GenerateExchangeCode_HttpRequestComplete

* Voice interface can run while on dedicated server but skips various calls that are only needed on client.Updates to generic voice implementation initialization to improve warnings/logging.

* WebBroser:Passing UStruct parameters to FWebJSFunction objects will copy them by value instead of (potentially dangling) pointers

* WebBrowser:Patches to CEF

    * Remove confusing error about renderer not being sandboxed, as that is always expected.

    * Work around a crash caused by Lavasoft WebCompanion on 64 bit Windows 8 or 10

* Reworked Android In App Purchase Code for Google play store to fit with the latest Google doc.

##### Mac

* New:Added PauseBatching to pause and ResumeBatching to resume the ShaderCache's shader precompilation as well as NumShaderPrecompilesRemaining which returns how many shaders remain to be processed.

    * Games can use these functions to suspend precompilation temporarily when the performance impact would be inappropriate and display progress when active.

* New:Added support for AddressSanitizer in UE4 via the Xcode project settings.

    * When AddressSanitizer is enabled in the target's Scheme in Xcode the build will compile and link with the AddressSanitizer libraries to instrument all memory allocations.

    * This requires a full rebuild of all source files and will also disable compiler optimizations to prevent reporting of errors caused by clang erroneously optimizing away the AddressSanitizer instrumentation.

    * The UE4_FORCE_MALLOC_ANSI environment variable must be enabled separately for AddressSanitizer to catch all possible memory errors.

* New:Added support for calling FOnGetContent in FSlateMacMenu

* New:Added support for ShaderPipeline's to the ShaderCache to allow pre-linking of OpenGL shaders into programs prior to rendering.

    * This ensures that all shaders and programs/pipelines are fully constructed prior to entering gameplay without needing to play through the game first, which will significantly reduce the number and severity of runtime hitching due to shaders.

    * Due to the nature of shader/program/pipeline construction this specific aspect of the ShaderCache can only function on OpenGL at present.

* New:Added the ShaderCacheTool command-line program which can merge shader cache files generated on different machines to make it easier for developers to ship a populated cache with their games.

* New:Changed XcodeSourceCodeAccessor to use xcode-select to find Xcode app

* Bind the index buffer as vertex attribute 0 when performing an attribute-less draw call to work around incorrect gl_VertexID values on NVIDIA drivers rather than using different index buffers.

* Detect when UE4 Mac is running under apitrace and fallback to using NSView rather than CoreAnimation to display so that tracing OpenGL works.

* Improved error handling in Mac media player

* Increment frame number & call Begin/EndFrame during loading screen movie playback so that RHI implementations can manage their internal resources correctly.

* Make UE4 on Mac warn about attempts to free memory with the MallocBinned allocator that wasn't allocated from it to avoid crashing on mismatched allocations and make such errors debuggable.

* Retain flow-control statements in Mac OpenGL at the request of Apple/vendors as they feel it should be faster.

* Update Distcc/DMUCS integration which requires explicit specification of the correct DistProp & server for DMUCS while the number of build hosts can be supplied via Xcode on OS X.

* When compiling shaders to GLSL append the source shader name when debug info (r.Shaders.KeepDebugInfo) is enabled to make shaders easier to debug.

##### Playstation 4

* New:Added platform interforce for SHA256 computation and support for /download0 as 'GamePeristentDownloadDir' on PS4.

* New:Added PS4 support for starting/stopping Razor profiler

    * Use SCOPE_PROFILER_INCLUDER and SCOPE_PROFILER_EXCLUDER for this

    * Note:Currently PS4 has no API for pausing and resuming Razor, so profling will be stopped after your scope ends

* New:Added r.PS4DumpExportStats 1 to dump in-game shader interpolator stats; requires r.PS4StripExtraShaderBinaryData=0

* New:Added some extra logging to FOnlineAsyncTaskPS4SessionCreate::DoWork() to help diagnose NP session creation errors.

* New:Added support for compressed vertex shader outputs using r.PS4PackParameters and related macros

* New:CPU memory prefetch function FPlatformMisc::Prefetch implemented for PS4.

* New:Compile times:Unity builds are now more deterministic

    * Before creating unity blobs, we now sort all full file paths alphabetically.This allows for better build system determinism across computers

* New:GitHub users can now exclude binary files from download by adding a .gitdepsignore file in the root of the repository.Syntax is the same as a normal .gitignore file.

* New:Included UE4.natvis file into the Visual Studio Engine Project to allow for easier debugging

* New:Merged most of the base pass static mesh draw lists into a single draw list, by using a common set of parameters for all light map policies.

    * The new parameters are regrouped into a uniform buffer.

* New:Runtime dependencies may now be flagged as optional from .build.cs files, so they won't cause an error if missing when trying to package.

* New:ShaderCompileWorker is automatically built as a dependency of the editor.To disable this behavior, set bEditorDependsOnShaderCompileWorker to false in the UEBuildConfiguration setting of your BuildConfiguration.xml file.

* New:The editor will no longer display an error message when compiling the project on startup if the -unattended switch is present.

* New:Unreal Build Tool:Output total number of actions to execute when building

* New:UnrealBuildTool can now be used to check that a single source file compiles.To use, set up a key binding from your IDE to launch UnrealBuildTool with the a command line of the format:'<ProjectName> <Platform> <Configuration> -singlefile=<FileName>'.

* New:UnrealVS now supported on Windows 10 without .NET 4.5 or older versions of the framework.

* New:Using the -precompile option with UnrealBuildTool will now build all engine modules.Overriding the GetModulesToPrecompile() function from a game's target rules is no longer necessary, and has been deprecated.

* Bugfix:Fixed issue with multiple projects sharing a file in the Engine's Intermediate directory

* Bugfix:Fixed performance automation tests unavailable in Test build configurations

    * Automation features are no longer compiled out in Test configuration at runtime (except in Shipping).

* Bugfix:Fixed Unreal Header Tool being compiled with older compiler (VS 2013) when actually targeting Visual Studio 2015Compile times

* Bugfix:Fixed game plugin modules not able to use engine shared PCHs

    * This change greatly improves compile times for game plugin modules

    * Game modules never depend on the game itself, so there was no reason not to use shared PCHs by default

* Cooking from the editor will only compile UAT scripts for the current project, excluding other projects under the same engine root.

* Unreal Build Tool:Fixed XGE console output visible even when XGE is not available

* Updated the UnrealBuildTool project file to prevent rule set warnings.

* New:End of frame updates now optionally can do the gamethread updates while we are doing parallel updates.The relevant cvars are AllowAsyncRenderThreadUpdates and AllowAsyncRenderThreadUpdatesDuringGamethreadUpdates.The latter is disabled by default.

* New:Exposed GetVectorParameterByName and GetScalarParameterByName on UMaterialParameterCollection as DLL exported methods

* New:Reworked task graph in many, many ways.Most of the changes are really only enabled for the PS4 at this point, but will over time migrate to all platforms.After that, there is much cleanup to do.

* Bugfix:Eliminated a fatal error for FD3D11DynamicRHI::RHIGetAvailableResolutions in the case of running over remote desktop.

* Bugfix:Fixed live streaming bug with creating RHI resource on game thread (instead of render thread)

* Bugfix:Fixed memory leak in the view state.

* Bugfix:Fixed rare bug with bogus preshadows ending up with "cull none".Added checks to make sure that never happens.

* Bugfix:Fixed separate translucency in parallel, but without a rendering thread and added some protection to UnresolvedTargets.

* CalcTextureMipMapSize3D and CalcTextureMipMapSize now round up instead of down so that they will no longer return zero size values for small texture sizes.

* Changed the RHI thread dispatch tasks to be run on the RHI thread when we are doing async dispatch.

* Disabled parallel occlusion cull and added option for hipri tasks for parallel occlusion cull.

* Dynamically set stream source to avoid creating a separate drawing policy for each static mesh with vertex colors.

* Made the api consistent for FShaderResource::Get*Shader() methods

* Moved shader working dir to the OS temp directory on windows to avoid problems with this being in dropbox or other shared folders.

* New option for cmdlist balancing which is faster and doesn't take task thread resources.

    * We approximate the balance from the last frame.

* Removed fencing on volatile and write only vertex and index buffer locks.

##### FX

* New:Added UParticleSystem::IsLooping to indicate if any enabled emitters will loop forever

    * It is currently calculated during PostLoad() and BuildEmitters(), not serialized

* Bugfix:Fixed crash with clipped subuvs.

##### Optimizations

* New:Added support for FShaderPipeline and removing unused interpolators in a pipeline

* New:Increased max threads for task graph and added a way to reduce task threads at runtime for testing the optimal number.Added ability to change thread affinities on the fly so they can be tuned.Added a way to track excessive allocation at runtime without using the memory profiler:LogGameThreadMallocChurn.Enable.Fixed excessive malloc calls throughout engine.Reworked parallel queue ticks.Fixed GHitchThresholdCVar.Optimized gameplaytags.

* New:Optimized component movements by avoiding unnecesary virtual OnUpdateTransform calls.

* New:Velocity and Depth passes are now using shaders that do not calculate/export unused interpolators

* Added guards to prevent GC running when FLegacySlateFontInfoCache is being used by a non-game thread

* Cut down on allocations coming from text blocks in UMG.

* FCharacterList now returns its FCharacterEntry by value

    * This means that we can't accidentally hold a reference to memory that may become invalid if the array or maps that contain the FCharacterEntry are re-allocated.

* Stopped the Slate texture atlas being updated by the start-up movie thread

    * This could lead to a race-condition when loading your games style-set

##### Slate

* New:Added option "Allow Context Menu" to enable/disable context menu for SEditableText, SEditableTextBox, SMultiLineEditableText, SMultilineEditableTextBox.

    * This is also exposed via UMG and defaults to True.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when deleting a FSlateImageRun that isn't set to use a dynamic brush

* Bugfix:Fixed a memory leak in FSlateBatchData that can occur when a batch has no vertex or index data

* When an SToolTip::SetContentWidget is called, the ToolTipContent widget's font should now correctly use the font passed into the constructor.

## Upgrade Notes

### Animation

* **Multi-threaded Animation Optimization**

    * The change to allow more animation work to run in worker threads has required deprecating a lot of API calls in the animation system.The main driver behind this was to control data access more tightly across threads.To this end, much anim-graph-accessed data has been moved from UAnimInstance to a new struct - FAnimInstanceProxy.This proxy structure is where the meat of the data on UAnimInstance is found.

    * Here is an example of how one would build a custom native AnimInstance class using the new proxy, granting Blueprint access to its innards and avoiding copies of shared data between the proxy and the instance:

			USTRUCT()

			struct FExampleAnimInstanceProxy : public FAnimInstanceProxy

			{

				GENERATED_BODY()

				FExampleAnimInstanceProxy()

				:FAnimInstanceProxy()

				{}

				FExampleAnimInstanceProxy(UAnimInstance* Instance);

				virtual void Update(float DeltaSeconds) override

				{

					// Update internal variables

					MovementAngle += 1.0f * DeltaSeconds;

					HorizontalSpeed = FMath::Max(0.0f, HorizontalSpeed - DeltaSeconds);

				}

			public:

				UPROPERTY(Transient, BlueprintReadWrite, EditAnywhere, Category = "Example")

				float MovementAngle;

				UPROPERTY(Transient, BlueprintReadWrite, EditAnywhere, Category = "Example")

				float HorizontalSpeed;

			};

			UCLASS(Transient, Blueprintable)

			class UExampleAnimInstance : public UAnimInstance

			{

				GENERATED_UCLASS_BODY()

			private:

				// The AllowPrivateAccess meta flag will allow this to be exposed to Blueprint,

				// but only to graphs internal to this class.

				UPROPERTY(Transient, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Example", meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))

				FExampleAnimInstanceProxy Proxy;

				virtual FAnimInstanceProxy* CreateAnimInstanceProxy() override

				{

					// override this to just return the proxy on this instance

					return &Proxy;

				}

				virtual void DestroyAnimInstanceProxy(FAnimInstanceProxy* InProxy) override

				{

				}

				friend struct FExampleAnimInstanceProxy;

			};

* The following functions and variables of the **UAnimInstance** class are **now deprecated**:

    * UngroupedActivePlayerArrays, SyncGroupArrays, VertexAnims, MakeSequenceTickRecord, MakeBlendSpaceTickRecord, SequenceAdvanceImmediate, BlendSpaceAdvanceImmediate, CreateUninitializedTickRecord, GetSlotWeight, SlotEvaluatePose, ReinitializeSlotNodes, RegisterSlotNodeWithAnimInstance, UpdateSlotNodeWeight, ClearSlotNodeWeights, UpdateSlotRootMotionWeight, MontageEvaluationData, GetNodeFromIndexUntyped, GetCheckedNodeFromIndexUntyped, GetCheckedNodeFromIndex, GetNodeFromIndex, RootNode, EvaluateAnimation, NativeEvaluateAnimation, RequiredBones, AnimNotifies, GetSyncGroupReadIndex, GetSyncGroupWriteIndex, TickSyncGroupWriteIndex, MorphTargetCurves, MaterialParameterCurves, InitializationCounter, CachedBonesCounter, UpdateCounter, EvaluationCounter, SlotNodeInitializationCounter, bBoneCachesInvalidated, AddAnimNotifies, PassesFiltering, PassesChanceOfTriggering, AddAnimNotifyFromGeneratedClass, UpdateAnimationNode

* Direct anim Blueprint member variable access can be enabled and disabled using "Optimize Anim Blueprint Member Variable Access" in settings.

* Previous Blend In Time and Blend Out Time should recover to BlendIn.BlendTime and BlendOut.BlendTime.

    * This might cause some issue if you modified those nodes.

    * This change can cause animations to be resaved.Please make sure you resave those animations, otherwise, it will cause them to recompress everytime loading.

    * You should see the warning message coming up in the editor

### Automation

* All automation tests now require Context and Filter flags; omission will result in compile failures.

### Blueprints

* Bugfix:Fixed several blueprint nodes that did not properly handle Enum redirectors

* If you would like your Blueprint to execute development-only function calls at runtime in a cooked build, there is a new option in the Project Settings in the "Cooker" section called "Compile Blueprints in Development Mode" that can be toggled on.

    * Note that by default, these functions will no longer execute at runtime in a cooked build, so it will be necessary to enable this option for your project if you would like to continue to see log output from Blueprints in your cooked builds.

* If your game explicitly manages t.MaxFPS and also uses UGameUserSettings, please be aware that UGameUserSettings::ApplySettings will now update t.MaxFPS based on UGameUserSettings::FrameRateLimit

### Core

* You now put the settings in a centralized file, instead of having to place the file in the same content path the asset that has PerObjectConfig settings.

* PostSerialize is now correctly called on DataTables after loading from disk

* t.HitchThreshold (the time in seconds to be considered a hitch) has been renamed to t.HitchFrameTimeThreshold (in miliseconds) to be consistent with other performance target cvars

* The formatting of the "obj list" command has changed; external parsers for .memreport or log files that relied on the old formatting will need to be updated

* Use of IDelegateInstance::GetUObject can be replaced with a GetUObject call directly on the delegate.

    * Use of IDelegateInstance::GetFunctionName can be replaced with a TryGetBoundFunctionName call directly on the delegate in non-shipping builds only.

    * Other uses of IDelegateInstance should be rewritten to not depend on the delegate state.

* Your UCLASSes may stop compiling if you have accidentally relied on a public (or protected) access specifier coming from another class in the same file.Please make sure to explicitly specify the desired access in your class.

### Editor and Tools

* In Construction Scripts, it can be fairly customary to set all the various spline mesh parameters (static mesh, start/end, tangents, roll, up vector, scale) one by one.Electing to only update the static mesh on the final call will provide a worthwhile performance gain.

* See SESSION console command for details.

* Spline Mesh Component now has an extra optional parameter on any Blueprint calls which set the spline mesh parameters in some way, allowing the user to state whether the collision / mesh should be updated afterwards.

    * In Construction Scripts, it can be fairly customary to set all the various spline mesh parameters (static mesh, start/end, tangents, roll, up vector, scale) one by one.Electing to only update the static mesh on the final call will provide a worthwhile performance gain.

* The tab spawners for the widget reflector and atlas visualizers are now registered automatically when the SlateReflector module is loaded.These are now the only way to create these windows.

    * If you were doing this because you were placing it into your own window, you can take advantage of the fact that the widget reflector tab spawner is always available, and use the global tab manager to create your window and place a spawned widget reflector tab inside it - SummonPerfTestSuite in SPerfSuite.cpp provides an example of this.

    * If you were doing this in the handler of your own widget reflector tab spawner, you can either just use the standard widget reflector tab spawner instead (you need to load the SlateReflector module once, and then "WidgetReflector" will be available to spawn via the global tab manager), or you can just use the DisplayWidgetReflector function of ISlateReflectorModule (which will internally do the same thing).

    * To use this feature select multiple targets within the Project Launcher, or from the command line separate each target device with a '+'.

### Gameplay Framework

* If you make use of the OnUpdateTransform virtual on USceneComponent, you now need to makes sure bWantsOnUpdateTransform is set true.

### Localization

* If any localization namespaces contain a comma in their name, existing PO files should be edited so that any msgctxt refering to that namespace prepends a backslash before the comma.

* Translations for dialogue wave spoken text in localization archives should be moved into the root localization namespace from the "Dialogue" localization namespace.

### Networking

* Beacon types are set by their UObject class name rather than specified by developers.This will prevent accidental incompatibility with derived child classes.

    * After specifying the ClientBeaconActorClass in the child class, set the BeaconTypeName equal to ClientBeaconActorClass->GetName() and remove any previous implementation of a "beacon name" from the code.

### Online

* Implement the OnShowDialog and OnDismissAllDialogs events to get callbacks when the browser want to pop up or hide dialogs

* The SWebBrowserView widget can be used as a near drop-in replacement for SWebBrowser in cases where ShowControls, ShowAddressBar and ShowInitialThrobber were set to false.Swap out the class name and remove these options from the construction.

### Other

* Following this change, your Editor and projects will have default values for new privacy settings.To change these, go to the following settings in the Editor:

    * Editor Settings -> Privacy -> Send Usage Data (defaults to True)

    * Project Settings -> End User Settings -> Send Anonymous Usage Data To Epic (defaults to True)

### Physics

* PhysicsThrusterComponent.h is no longer included by default in Engine.h

### Platforms

* Existing profiles should be moved to the new location automatically when UFE launches.

#### Playstation 4

* PS4 has been updated to SDK 3.008.201

* SDK 2.5 is no longer supported.Projects on 4.11 will need to upgrade to SDK 3.0

* More memory can now be given to the GPU heap.

#### Xbox One

* The November 2015 XDK represents a significant change in XDK layout and APIs.

    * Using an XDK version older than November 2015 with this version of the engine will require significant code changes.

    * Manifest generation will not function with the original November 2015 XDK.Please use at least QFE 1 with this release.

### Programming

* The XGE build hang was fixed in an update to the UCRT.It is recommended to install the UCRT update to fix the issue at it's source.

    * This update is available at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50410](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50410).

* If you use EMouseCaptureMode::Type directly you'll need to convert them to EMouseCaptureMode.

### Rendering

* Affect the look, content retweak might be needed but the new way provides more control and quality

* Can cause a lot of texture to be recooked

* Fixes minor colorshift on object borders, more visible with large radius, as this changes the look retweaking might be needed

* Look change is possible, might have to change content

* Some texture might look a bit sharper and adjusting the settings could be considered

#### Lighting

* This may show shadow acne from movable lights more in extreme cases.

#### Postprocessing

* Look change might need retweaking of the materials

#### Optimizations

* If you derive from USceneComponent and want the virtual function OnUpdateTransform to be called, you now need to make sure the bWantsOnUpdateTransform flag is enabled.This is true by default, but disabled on some classes (e.g. particle components).

### UI

* The text layout now requires some extra context to handle text shaping.See FSlateTextRun for an example of how these API changes affect how you deal with text within your custom run types.

    * IRun::Measure and IRun::GetKerning now take a FRunTextContext parameter.

    * IRun::CreateBlock now takes a FLayoutBlockTextContext parameter.

#### Slate

* Use SLATE_ATTRIBUTE and SLATE_ARGUMENT with the FText type instead of SLATE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE and SLATE_TEXT_ARGUMENT

### C++ API Changes

* The DecalSize parameter to SpawnDecalAtLocation() and SpawnDecalAttached() has been changed to be consistent with similar functions and the editor UI.The components are now interpreted as (XYZ) rather than (ZYX).Uses of these functions need to be changed to swap the X and Z components of DecalSize otherwise the decal may appear stretched or not show up at all.

* The shader platform SP_OPENGL_ES2 has been renamed to SP_OPENGL_ES2_ANDROID in the C++ source code to better reflect that it is used only on Android.

* Unnecessary AI navigation-related headers has been removed from Engine.h.You may need to manually include headers of navigation classes now.

* USCS_Node::ChildNodes is now a private member.Manipulation must be performed via accessor functions.Direct reference of USCS_Node::ChildNodes is now prohibited.Modify code to use accessor functions exposed in USCS_Node instead.

* Removed debug/show rendering features on shipping I did the first part, lock some showflags to be 0 or 1 in SHIPPING.Some code might rely on that - consider not using showflags e.g. PostProcessSettings or change the line in ShowFlags.inl

* We now use App Id terminology instead of Client Id.Replaced all ClientId usage with AppId.

* UActorComponent::OnComponentDestroyed now takes a boolean parameter that indicates whether the entire Actor that owns the component is being destroyed at once or if the component is being destroyed independently.This can be used to avoid expensive operations like individually detaching scene components for an entire hierarchy that is being destroyed at once.

* Unreal Build Tool:Using the -precompile option with UnrealBuildTool will now build all engine modules.Overriding the GetModulesToPrecompile() function from a game's target rules is no longer necessary, and has been deprecated.

* Refactored automated test flags

    * Added Disabled flag to disable tests without commenting-out or deleting code.

    * Replaced Smoke Test button in Automation Front End with a Filters dropdown.

    * Test configurations do not compile out Automation features (except in Shipping mode).

    * Automation tests can be triggered from in-game console in non-editor builds (automation controller is enabled).

* Srialization:Exposed entire serializer state in backend API.See the documentation in IStructSerializerBackend and the changes in FJsonStructSerializerBackend and WebJSStructSerializerBackend for details.

* Media:Changed UMediaPlayer.IsStopped to .IsReady.Change usages of IsStopped() to !IsReady()

* Analytics-related settings changes:

    * Deprecated UEditorSettings::bEditorAnalyticsEnabled in General (advanced) Editor Settings.Use UAnalyticsPrivacySettings::bSendUsageData (see AreEditorAnalyticsEnabled()).

    * Deprecated UEngine::bHardwareSurveyEnabled config value.Use UEndUserSettings::bSendAnonymousUsageDataToEpic (see AreGameAnalyticsEnabled()).

* The ENGINE_VERSION define has been removed, and replaced with references to FEngineVersion::Current().The BUILT_FROM_CHANGELIST define is still available where required.

* Existing overrides of the virtual OnComponentDestroyed must change their signature to accept the boolean parameter and pass it along to the Super::OnComponentDestroyed.

* Added new RHITransitionResources API for adding explicit GPU barriers for APIs which require them.

* The tabbed layout within the widget reflector has made it impossible to create the widget reflector unless spawned via a tab manager.To this end, the following functions have been removed from ISlateReflectorModule:

    * GetWidgetReflector

    * GetAtlasVisualizer

    * GetTextureAtlasVisualizer

    * GetFontAtlasVisualizer

* New option to reduce the number of render targets updated in the main render pass of opaque materials.

    * It can be enabled by setting "r.SelectiveBasePassOutputs=1" in the engine ini file.

    * This affects the following render targets : custom data, preshadow factors and velocity buffer.

* Because text shaping requires some extra context, there have been some API changes:

    * IRun::Measure and IRun::GetKerning now take a FRunTextContext parameter.

    * IRun::CreateBlock now takes a FLayoutBlockTextContext parameter.

* The TargetRules.GetModulesToPrecompile() has been deprecated.Using the -precompile argument with UnrealBuildTool will now precompile all compatible engine modules.

* ChildActors now inherit their visibility from the owning component and actor visibility

* AActor::ParentComponentActor has been deprecated and made private.Use GetParentComponent() or IsChildActor() to reach the same information.

* Renamed automation test flags to remove ATF_ prefix

    * Split ATF_Game flag into ClientContext and ServerContext flags

    * Removed action option flags.

    * Replaced EAutomationTestType flags with filter flags in EAutomationTestFlags.

* Added ability to automatically generate mip-maps for a RenderTarget2D resource.

* Media:Simplified media event related API

* IMediaPlayer.OnClosed, .OnEndReached, OnOpened, .OnOpenFailed, and .OnTracksChanged have been replaced with .OnMediaEvent that provides a value of the new EMediaEvent enumeration type.

* Most of the keying logic has been moved from individual tracks and sections to a new base class called FKeyframeTrackEditor.

    * Custom FPropertyTrackEditors have a few new abstract methods to implement which are documented in the header.

    * Custom UMovieSceneSections must implement the IKeyframeSection which is documented in it's header.

* Moved AttachmentReplication update out of SceneComponent and to ActorReplication.It only needs to be done on the network authority and only for the root component, and replication updates is a better place to check this.

* AActor::AttachmentReplication is now private.This is filled in via GatherCurrentMovement() when the RootComponent has an AttachParent.

    * This was made private because too many people were trying to update this struct to try to change attachment state, only to have those changes overwritten during replication.It is simply used to replicate attachment state, and attachment should be changed the usual way through the component and actor functions.

    * Added a read-only accessor, GetAttachmentReplication().

* Optimized FCollisionQueryParams::AddIgnoredActor() and AddIgnoredComponents().

* FCollisionQueryParams::IgnoreComponents is now private, use AddIgnoredComponent() and GetIgnoredComponents() instead.

    * This enabled an optimization to make the components list unique only once on-demand in GetIgnoredComponents(), rather each time a component is added.

* Optimization:Inlined ACharacter methods:GetMesh(), GetCharacterMovement(), GetCapsuleComponent(), GetArrowComponent().

* ACharacter members MeshComponent, CharacterMovement, CapsuleComponent, and ArrowComponent are now private.They have been marked with DEPRECATED_FORGAME for a few releases now.

    * Please use the GetMesh(), GetCharacterMovement(), GetCapsuleComponent(), GetArrowComponent() accessors instead.

* Optimized character net location update and mesh interpolation to cause fewer transform updates, especially on the mesh.

    * Added Character::bClientCheckEncroachmentOnNetUpdate to control whether we care about checking for encroachment when we get a new network location.

* Character::UpdateSimulatedPosition() has been deprecated in favor of OnUpdateSimulatedPosition(), and now occurs after SmoothCorrection().It is no longer responsible for updating the transform.

    * UCharacterMovement::SmoothCorrection() is now responsible for updating the capsule to the new location/rotation.

    * SmoothCorrection() no longer moves the character mesh at all (which is the same net result as before since it used to just undo the rotation change from the server).

* Viewports can now use both pre-multiplied and non-pre-multiplied alpha blending

    * SViewport now has an PreMultipliedAlpha argument (default true), which can control whether to use pre-multiplied alpha when blending is enabled (blending is disabled by default).

    * Note:This is a change in behavior from 4.10, as non-pre-multiplied alpha blending used to be the default.

* FSlateDrawElement API cleanup:

    * FSlateDrawElement::MakeGradient no longer takes a bInGammaCorrect bool, instead pass ESlateDrawEffect::NoGamma as part of InDrawEffects to disable gamma correction.

    * FSlateDrawElement::MakeViewport no longer takes a bInGammaCorrect bool, instead pass ESlateDrawEffect::NoGamma as part of InDrawEffects to disable gamma correction.

    * FSlateDrawElement::MakeViewport no longer takes a bInAllowBlending bool, instead pass ESlateDrawEffect::NoBlending as part of InDrawEffects to disable blending.
