# 새로운 내용

이번 릴리즈는 다수의 신기능과 여러가지 퍼포먼스 최적화로 꾸려져 있습니다. 저희 차기작 게임 파라곤 발매를 준비하면서, 퍼포먼스야 말로 큰 관심사였는데요. 4.11 에는 실사 캐릭터 렌더링에 초점을 맞춘 새로운 렌더링 & 애니메이션 기능이 다수 포함되어 있으며, 새로운 오디오 기능과 툴 개선사항도 준비되어 있습니다. VR 관련해서도, VR 렌더링 개번과 최신 SDK 지원으로 최신 발매 VR 하드웨어로도 게임을 발매할 수 있도록 준비하고 있습니다.

# 주요 기능

## 퍼포먼스 및 멀티스레딩

지난 몇 개월간은 UE4 를 최적화시켜, 저희 차기작 게임 파라곤이 PC 와 PlayStation 4 에서 60fps 가 나오도록 하는 데 주력했습니다.

파라곤은 저희 팀에 독특한 도전과제를 세트로 안겨줬습니다. 파라곤에서는 한 번에 애니메이션이 있는 10 명의 영웅과 120 마리 이상의 미니언, 엄청난 양의 FX 를 지원하면서 동시에 아름답고 세밀한 맵을 먼 가시거리까지 60fps 로 렌더링해야 합니다. 파라곤은 엔진을 한계까지 밀어붙였으며, 특히나 애니메이션과 렌더링 부분이 그랬습니다.

![image alt text](image_0.png)

엔진 전반에 걸친 수천종의 자잘한 최적화는 파라곤 퍼포먼스의 커다란 향상으로 이어졌으며, UE4 로 제작되는 모든 게임에도 이득이 될 것입니다. 그 최적화 다수가 4.11 에 포함되어 있으며, 추후 릴리즈 버전에는 더욱 많아질 것입니다. 지금까지 작업한 최적화 굵직한 것 중 몇 가지는 이렇습니다.

**병렬처리**. 멀티코어 배분은 최신 PC 와 콘솔에서 높은 프레임을 내기 위해 매우 중요한 부분이기에, 여러가지 방법으로 **스레딩 아키텍처** 를 개선시켰습니다. 이를 통해 태스크 생성 비용 감소, 높은 우선권 태스크 지원, 다수의 동기화 지점 제거 등이 이루어졌습니다.

**렌더링 퍼포먼스**. 이제 렌더러의 GPU 용 명령 버퍼 생성 및 워커 태스크 크기 밸런싱 능력을 개선시켜 GPU 부하 추가 없이 최대한의 병렬 처리 성능을 낼 수 있습니다. 렌더러의 동기화 지점을 제거하여 가능한 모든 코어를 더욱 잘 활용할 수 있도록도 했습니다.

**클로스 시뮬레이션** 이 대폭 빨라져 멀티 스레딩을 더욱 잘 활용합니다. 이제 워커 스레드에서 각 애셋에 대한 APEX 솔버를 직접 호출합니다. 이로써 스케쥴 성능이 훨씬 개선되고 다수의 동기화 지점과 부하가 제거됩니다. 클로딩은 이제 (블렌딩이 필요치 않은 경우) 애니메이션 이후 업데이트되고, 그렇지 않은 경우 스켈레탈 메시 컴포넌트 업데이트 이후에 일어납니다.

**가비지 컬렉션** 속도가 빨라졌습니다. 이제 가비지 컬렉션 "클러스터"를 지원, 엔진이 오브젝트 그룹을 하나의 단위로 취급하도록 하여, 고려할 오브젝트 갯수를 현저히 줄이는 것이 가능해졌습니다. 현재 머티리얼과 파티클 시스템에 대해서만 클러스터가 지원됩니다. 추가적으로 마킹 & 소멸 단계가 캐시와의 일관성이 높아져, 시간적인 면에서는 1/9 로 감소되고, 도달가능성 분석 단계 도중에서도 메모리 교란(churn) 정도가 줄었습니다.

**멀티 스레드 애니메이션.** 애니메이션 그래프 업데이트가 이제 워커 스레드에서 실행되어 다수의 애니메이션 캐릭터를 복수 코어에 배분시킬 수 있게 되었습니다. 애니메이션 관련 API 다수가 폐기되고, 애니메이션 그래프의 워커 스레드 실행상 제약이 있으니 업그레이드 노트를 참고하시기 바랍니다.

**즉시 애니메이션 변수 접근.** 애니메이션 그래프 업데이트에 변수 접근을 위한 '빠른 경로'를 추가했습니다. 그 덕에 블루프린트 코드 실행 없이 내부적으로 파라마터를 복사해 주기만 하면 됩니다. 현재 컴파일러가 최적화할 수 있는 구조체는, 멤버 변수, 무효화된 부울 멤버 변수, 중첩 구조체의 멤버입니다.

**애니티브 애니메이션 '굽기'.** 이제 **애디티브 애니메이션 굽기** 를 켤 수 있는 옵션이 생겼습니다. 이로 인해 애디티브 애니메이션 사용이 약 **3 배 빨라졌습니다**. 애디티브 애니메이션의 델타 포즈 계산에 소요되는 작업이 실행시간이 아닌 쿠킹 시간에 이루어집니다. 그 덕에 애디티브 델타 생성에 관련된 계산 작업뿐 아니라, 베이스 애니메이션 압축해제를 더이상 실행시간에 할 필요가 없어 그에 관련된 메모리 접근 및 할당도 줄었습니다. 이 기능을 켜면 쿠킹 시간이 늘어나므로, a.UseBakedAdditiveAnimations 콘솔 변수를 1 로 설정하여 켜줘야 합니다. 앞으로의 엔진 버전에서는 이러한 부분을 피하도록 애니메이션 쿠킹을 다시 하고, 이 최적화를 영구히 켜도록 할 것입니다.

## 신규: 실사 헤어 셰이딩

영화계의 최근 연구를 기반으로 하여 **현실적인 헤어를 위한 물리 기반 셰이딩 모델** 을 추가했습니다.

![image alt text](image_2.png)![image alt text](image_3.png)

스페큘러 로브 둘, 투과, 산란을 모델링합니다. 이 기능을 사용하려면, 단순히 머티리얼 에디터의 셰이딩 모델 목록에서 **Hair** 를 선택하면 됩니다.

## 신규: 실사 눈 셰이딩

이제 캐릭터의 눈에 대해서도 언리얼 엔진의 새로운 물리기반 셰이딩 모델을 사용하여 **매우 사실적인 눈** 표현이 가능합니다.

![image alt text](image_4.png)

이 셰이딩 모델은 눈 흰자위의 피하 산란, 홍채의 초면, 습윤층의 스페큘러 등을 추정해 냅니다. 눈 머티리얼과 눈알 지오메트리와 함께 사용하는 것이 좋으며, 그럴 경우 각막을 통한 굴절, 눈동자 외곽선 암화, 동공 확장 제어와 같은 추가 모델링이 가능합니다.

## 신규: 피부 셰이딩 개선

**사실적인 피부 셰이딩 모델** 인 서브서피스 스캐터링 프로파일의 **퀄리티와 퍼포먼스 향상** 이 이루어졌습니다.

![image alt text](image_5.png)

업데이트된 셰이딩 모델은 반해상도로 실행되며 차지하는 GPU 메모리도 적습니다. 산란은 해상도와 무관하게 이루어지며, 오브젝트 가장자리의 색 변이도 더이상 없습니다. 텍스처와 라이팅 디테일 보존 관련해서도, 디퓨즈와 스페큘러 라이팅 양쪽을 하나의 픽셀에 꾸려넣기 보다 체크무늬 패턴에 독립적으로 저장시키는 방식으로 개선되었습니다.

## 신규: 실사 클로스 셰이딩

**클로스용 물리 기반 셰이딩 모델** 을 추가했습니다. 흐릿한 층 시뮬레이션으로 전에 없던 수준의 사실적인 클로스 결과물을 내게 되었습니다. 머티리얼 에디터에서 클로스 셰이딩 모델을 선택하면 사용할 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_6.png)

## 신규: 캡슐 그림자

언리얼 엔진은 이제 캐릭터의 **캡슐 표현물** 로부터 **매우 연한 간접 그림자** 를 드리울 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_7.png)

보통 간접광만 있을 때는 스크린 스페이스 앰비언트 오클루전 말고 다른 그림자는 없습니다. 간접광은 여러 방향에서 오기에 간접 그림자는 매우 연해야 하는데, 전통적인 섀도 맵은 여기에 맞지 않습니다. 간접 그림자 방향과 연도는 볼륨 라이팅 샘플 배치와, 라이팅 빌드 도중의 라이트매스에 의해 계산됩니다.

게임 내에서, 간접 캡슐 그림자가 캐릭터를 배경 바닥에 안착시키는 효과를 내는 모습입니다:

![image alt text](image_8.png)

직접 그림자에도 캡슐을 사용할 수 있습니다. 라이트의 Source Radius 또는 Source Angle 옵션으로 얼마나 연하게 할지를 결정합니다. 이를 통해 라이팅을 구은 효율적인 환경에서 매우 부드러운 캐릭터 그림자를 낼 수 있는데, 전에는 불가능했던 일입니다.

![image alt text](image_9.png)

이 캡슐 그림자 구현은 섀도잉을 반해상도로 계산한 뒤 깊이에 따른 업샘플링을 사용하고, 스크린 타일 컬링을 통해 섀도잉 작업을 꼭 필요한 곳에만 제한시키므로 매우 효율적입니다.

GPU 비용은 드리워진 그림자에 영향받은 픽셀 수와 캡슐 수에 비례합니다.

캡슐 그림자 활성화 방법:

1. Sphyl 바디(캡슐)로만 피직스 애셋을 새로 만듭니다. 구체도 가능합니다만 유연성이 떨어집니다. 캡슐은 조인트 부분에 살짝 겹쳐야 합니다. 발 캡슐이 가장 중요한데, 캐릭터가 땅에 안착해 보이도록 미세조정해야 합니다. 팔은 보통 커버를 활용하거나 땅을 기지 않는 이상 필요지 않습니다.

2. 스켈레탈 메시 애셋의 섀도 피직스 애셋에 그 피직스 애셋을 할당합니다.

3. 마지막으로, 스켈레탈 메시 컴포넌트에 캡슐 간접 그림자를 켭니다.

## 신규: 파티클 뎁스 오브 필드

작은 초점을 벗어난 파티클을 불투명 파티클 렌더링시와 같은 방식으로 뎁스 오브 필드에 확장시키는 것이 가능한 머티리얼 함수가 새로 생겼습니다.

![image alt text](image_10.png)

왼쪽 그림은 땅에 다수의 파티클이 배치된 단순한 씬입니다. 오른쪽 그림은 원형 뎁스 오브 필드가 활성화되어, 새로운 머티리얼 함수가 초점을 벗어난 파티클을 다른 모든 지오메트리처럼 렌더링합니다. 퀄리티는 심지어 더 나은데, 노이즈 부작용을 겪지 않기 때문입니다. 깜빡임 방지를 위해 항상 초점을 벗어난 파티클은 한 픽셀 이상 확장시킵니다.

이 기능은 파티클 머티리얼에 변화를 가해야 합니다:

![image alt text](image_11.png)

## 신규: 디더링된 오파시티 마스크

이제 Dithered Opacity Mask 를 통해 불투명 머티리얼을 사용하여 **반투명 표면 에뮬레이션** 이 가능합니다.

![image alt text](image_12.png)

머티리얼 에디터의 "Dithered Opacity Mask" (디더링된 오파시티 마스크) 체크박스는 템포럴 안티에일리어싱 활성화시 순서 무관 반투명의 확률적 형태입니다. 템포럴 AA 를 사용하여 여러 프레임에 걸쳐 전경의 오브젝트와 배경을 블렌딩합니다. 이를 통해 약간의 노이즈와 고스팅 비용으로 세미-반투명 오브젝트에 대해 디퍼드 셰이딩의 모든 기능을 활용할 수 있습니다.

## 신규: 디더링된 LOD 크로스페이드

스태틱 메시는 이제 애니메이션이 적용된 디더링 패턴을 사용하여 **레벨 오브 디테일간의 부드러운 상호전환** 이 가능합니다.

![image alt text](image_13.gif)(convert:false)

주:  이 기능은 약간의 퍼포먼스 비용이 있어 머티리얼에서 켜줘야 합니다.

![image alt text](image_14.png)

## 신규: 계층형 LOD 개선

이번 릴리즈에는 **계층형 레벨 오브 디테일** (HLOD) 시스템이 **크게 개선** 되었습니다. 계층형 LOD 는 다수의 디테일 메시가 멀리 있을 때 소수의 간단한 메시로 자동 대체해 주는 기능입니다. 그 덕에 오브젝트를 가까이 볼 때는 높은 퀄리티가 유지되고, 레벨의 전반적인 퍼포먼스가 빨라졌습니다.

![image alt text](image_15.png)

파라곤의 **Agora** (아고라) 맵으로, 트라이앵글 수는 (394만 에서) 256만으로, 드로 콜 수는 (7060 에서 5690) 으로 줄었습니다.

HLOD 를 최대한 활용하기 위해서는, Simplygon SDK (별도 라이선스)가 필요합니다. Simplygon 은 폴리곤 수가 적은 프록시 메시를 생성하는 데 필요합니다. 없는 경우, 시스템에서는 굽기를 통해 다른 머티리얼을 사용하는 섹션만 하나의 드로 콜로 합칩니다.

또한 새로 생긴 **계층형 LOD 아웃라이너** 는 레벨의 HLOD 구성에 도움이 되는 세팅이 여러가지 있습니다.

## 신규: VR 인스턴스드 스테레오 렌더링

Instanced Stereo Rendering (인스턴스드 스테레오 렌더링)은 엔진의 VR 헤드셋용 입체 이미지 렌더링 효율을 높여주는 최적화입니다.

기존에는, 엔진이 입체 이미지를 렌더링할 때, 왼쪽 눈의 모든 것을 그린 다음 오른쪽 눈의 모든 것을 그렸습니다. 인스턴스드 스테레오 렌더링은, 양쪽 눈을 동시에 렌더링하여, CPU 작업을 대폭 줄여주고, GPU 효율성을 향상시킵니다. 두 가지 기법을 비교해 보면 이렇습니다:

![image alt text](image_16.gif)(convert:false)

테스트 콘텐츠로 Bullet Train 을 들어 보면, 별다른 작업 없이도 CPU 시간에서 약 14%, GPU 에서 약 7% 향상되었습니다! 대부분의 렌더링 기능이 스테레오 인스턴싱과 작동은 하지만, 아직 지원하지 않는 기능도 (DFAO 등) 몇 가지 있습니다.

프로젝트에 이 기능을 사용하려면, 에디터의 프로젝트 세팅으로 가서 "Instanced Stereo" (인스턴스드 스테레오) 박스를 체크하면 됩니다.

![image alt text](image_17.png)

## 신규: 애님 다이내믹스 (캐릭터의 빠른 물리 시뮬레이션)

**Anim Dynamics** (애님 다이내믹스)는 자체적으로 독립된 애니메이션 블루프린트용 완전 새로운 **단순 물리 시뮬레이션** 노드로, 피직스 솔루션 전체를 사용할 필요 없이 스켈레탈 메시에 동적인 모션을 프로시저럴 방식으로 추가시킬 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_18.gif)(convert:false)

애님 다이내믹스의 주요 기능에 대한 개요입니다:

* **리짓 바디 시뮬레이션 단순화**

    * 애니메이션 평가 단계에서 실행됩니다.

    * 애니메이션 반응을 위해 컴포넌트 스페이스에서 실행됩니다.

    * 빠른 시뮬레이션을 위해 콜리전이 없습니다.

    * 중력 계산에는 박스만 지원됩니다.

* **리짓 바디 컨스트레인트**

    * Angular 각형 - 셋째 축은 잠긴 두 축 컨스트레인트입니다. 리짓 바디는 두 축을 중심으로 한 주어진 각도 범위 내에서 회전 가능합니다. 직선축 & 평면축과 같이 사용할 수 있습니다.

    * Cone 원뿔형 - 리짓 바디를 컨스트레인트에 지정된 각도 내에 유지시키는 자유 회전 컨스트레인트입니다. 직선축 & 평면축 컨스트레인트와 같이 사용할 수 있지만, 선택되면 각축은 대체됩니다.

    * Prismatic 직선형 - 세 개의 주요 축 모두에 대한 이동을 지정된 한계치로 제한시키는 3 축 선형 컨스트레인트입니다.

    * Planar 평면형 - 리짓 바디가 절대 건널 수 없는 무한 확장 면 목록으로, 걸려있는 오브젝트의 바닥면 또는 오브젝트가 캐릭터에 관통되지 않도록 할 때 사용할 수 있습니다. 각 면은 월드 스페이스에 배치되거나, 그 트랜스폼을 캐릭터의 본으로 구동시킬 수 있습니다.

* **체인**

    * 각 노드는 하나의 다이내믹 본 또는 비슷한 컨스트레인트 데이터를 공유하는 다수의 다이내믹 본 체인을 표현할 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 다수의 연결 바디 시뮬레이션시 보다 현실적인 방식의 작동이 가능합니다.

    * 하나의 노드로는 체인으로 힘을 밀어 가하기만 할 뿐, 그 반응이 전파되지 않습니다 - 체인 모드로 양방향 힘을 가할 수 있어 보다 나은 체인을 만들 수 있습니다.

* **스프링 타깃**

    * 선형 & 각형 스프링으로 보다 높은 탄성 효과를 낼 수 있습니다. 이 스프링은 개별적으로 환경설정 가능하며, 다양한 스프링 상수를 가질 수 있습니다.

* **바람**

    * 애님 다이내믹스는 APEX 클로스 오브젝트에 영향을 끼치는 것과 동일한 바람 소스 액터와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다. 이는 노드별로 껐다 켰다 토글 가능하며, 스케일 조절을 통해 완벽한 바람의 느낌을 낼 수 있습니다.

* **적응형 서브스테핑**

    * 시뮬레이션은 피직스 프로젝트 세팅에서 취한 보통 틱 세팅으로 실행시킬 수도 있고, 적응형 서브스텝을 사용해서 실행시킬 수도 있습니다.

    * 시뮬레이션은 노드별로 환경설정 가능합니다 - 그래서 시뮬레이션의 추가 반복처리를 통한 수렴이 필요한 경우, 서로간의 시뮬레이션에 영향을 끼치지 않고 필요한 만큼 만들도록 환경설정 가능합니다.

    * 이 모드에서는 시뮬레이션이 실제 실행된 시간부터의 게임 틱 발생 시간을 독자적으로 기록, 뒤쳐지기 시작하면 시간 빚을 유지하고 시뮬레이션을 여러 번 실행시킵니다. 이는 꼬리를 무는 문제가 생길 수 있어서 최대치 제한이 있지만, 복잡한 시뮬레이션에 안정성을 더할 수 있습니다.

* **시각화**

    * 노드 선택시 다양한 부분을 시각화시키는 옵션이 노드에 있습니다. 사용할 수 있는 비주얼라이저에서 커버하는 부분은:

        * 각형 제한

        * 직선형 제한

        * 평면형 제한

        * 평면형 제외 메서드 (평면형 제한을 포함한 구체같은 콜리전)

## 신규: 게임플레이 라이브 애니메이션 녹화

이제 **라이브 게임플레이** 도중 스켈레탈 메시의 **애니메이션 녹화** 를 한 뒤 애님 시퀀스 애셋으로 저장할 수 있습니다!

![image alt text](image_19.gif)(convert:false)

이 애셋은 엔진 내에서 사용하거나, FBX 로 익스포트하여 써드파티 툴에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 이는 라이브든 리플레이 감상이든, 실제 게임 상황에서도 작동합니다.

이 기능 사용법:

* 애니메이션을 녹화하려면, 콘솔창에 다음 명령을 입력합니다:  **RecordAnimation** MyActorClass_05 /Content/Foo/RecordedAnimation

* 녹화 중지 명령은:  **StopRecordingAnimation **MyActorClass_05 또는 **StopRecordingAnimation** all

* 애셋 경로를 생략하거나 잘못된 경로를 입력하면, 선택창이 뜹니다. 월드 아웃라이너를 사용하여 녹화하고자 하는 액터 이름을 찾을 수 있습니다 (액터 위에 커서를 올리면 그 "ID 이름"을 알 수 있습니다).

## 신규: 뎁스 오브 필드 퀄리티 향상

이제 뎁스 오브 필드 샘플링 수 ("Circle DOF")를 늘리는 것으로, 약간의 퍼포먼스 추가 비용에 노이즈를 감소시켜 퀄리티를 향상시킬 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_20.png)

## 신규: 플랫폼 & SDK 업데이트

일반적인 업데이트와 아울러, 다양한 VR 플랫폼 출시 한도에 맞춰 타이틀 출시가 가능하도록 주요 VR 플랫폼 전부 최신 SDK 를 사용하도록 업데이트했습니다. 이 업데이트와 아울러 안정성 및 최종 마무리 작업에도 집중적으로 신경을 써, 4.11 의 UE4 타이틀은 무엇이든 "VR 발매 가능!" 상태일 것입니다.

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_21.png)
[/REGION]

이번 릴리즈에서의 플랫폼 하이라이트입니다:

* Oculus Rift 1.3.0 SDK 가 언리얼 엔진 4.11 핫픽스로 곧 나올 예정입니다. (언리얼 엔진 4.11.0 에는 Oculus Rift SDK 0.8.0 베타입니다)  

* Oculus Mobile SDK 1.01

* Playstation VR SDK 3

* SteamVR 0.9.12

* PS4 SDK 3.008.201 (w/ PSVR)

* Xbox One XDK November QFE 1

* HTML5 SDK (Emscripten) 1.35.0

* Linux Clang 3.7.0

* Apple tvOS 9.0 support (GitHub 전용)

## 신규: DirectX 12 개선

![image alt text](image_22.png)

언리얼 엔진에 Microsoft 의 DirectX 12 업데이트를 통합, 렌더링 명령 병렬 생성시의 CPU 활용도를 높임과 동시에, 다중 루트 시그너처 지원, 비동기 파이프라인 상태 디스크 캐시 기본 활성화, 메모리 요구량 감소 & 누수 해결, 리소스 전환 최적화, 메모리 할당 속도 향상, GPU 유휴 시간 도중 작업 플러싱을 통한 GPU 기아 현상이 제한됩니다.

### Xbox One 용 DirectX 12

Microsoft 가 **Xbox One** 에서의 **DirectX 12** 지원이 실험단계로 추가되었습니다!

이 기능 활성화는 몇 단계로 이루어집니다:

* BaseEngine.ini 의 XboxOneRuntimeSettings 섹션에 **bBuildForD3D12** 를 **true** 로 설정합니다.

* XboxOneShaderCompiler.cpp 에서 D3D12_ROOT_SIGNATURE 를 1 로 설정합니다.

* PostProcessSelectionOutline.usf 의 GetSamplePosition 사용 부분을 코멘트로 뺍니다 (아직 Xbox One 에는 지원되지 않습니다).

* 리빌드 후 재시작합니다!

실험단계 속성상, 활성화시 렌더링 및/또는 안전성 문제가 있을 수 있습니다.

## 신규: Mac OS X 에서의 Metal 렌더링

Mac OS X El Capitan 에서 Metal 이 기본 그래픽 API 가 되었습니다!

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_23.png)
[/REGION]

에픽에서는 Apple, AMD, NVIDIA, Intel 과 긴밀히 협업하여 Mac 용 Metal 을 통합하였으며, 4.11 에서는 OS X El Capitan 에 대한 주 그래픽 API 로 OpenGL 을 대체하게 되었습니다. 4.11 릴리즈에는 기본적으로 Metal 과 OpenGL 에 걸쳐 동일한 렌더링 기능이 제공됩니다. Metal 에는 미리 컴파일된 셰이더와 효율적인 멀티스레드 지원을 통해 GPU 연산력을 극대화시키는 고효율 저부하 API 가 제공됩니다. 계속해서 Mac Metal 에 대한 지원을 확장 발전시키도록 하겠으며, 앞으로의 엔진 버전에서 새로운 API 기능이 적극 활용될 것을 기대합니다.

셰이더 모델 5 기능에 대한 Metal 의 실험단계 지원도 추가되어, 명령줄 스위치에 "-metalsm5" 를 붙여 시도해 보실 수 있습니다.

## 신규: 라이팅 빌드 속도 향상 (Intel Embree 지원)

**Intel 의 Embree 레이 트레이싱** 라이브러리를 라이트매스에 통합, 그와 관련된 라이팅 빌드 속도가 대폭 향상되었습니다.

라이팅 빌드 시간의 대부분은 레이 트레이싱에서 빛이 어떻게 튕기는지 알아내는 데 들어갑니다. 실험 사례로 "Sun Temple" 레벨 라이팅 빌드 시간이 Embree 를 사용했더니 (45 초에서 18 초로) **2.4 배 빨라졌습니다**! Indirect Lighting Quality 를 4 로 설정한 상태에서 결과물은 시각적으로 동일했습니다.

## 신규: 라이트매스 포탈

스카이라이트의 실내 퀄리티가, 개방된 곳에 Portal (포탈) 액터를 구성하는 것으로 크게 향상됩니다.

![image alt text](image_24.png)(w:640 convert:false)

포탈 액터는 라이트매스더러 어디에 빛이 입사되는지를 알려줄 뿐, 실제 발광하지는 않습니다. 사용하기 가장 좋은 곳은, 작지만 최종 라이팅에 중요한 영향을 끼치는 개방구를 커버할 때입니다. 그러면 라이트 & 섀도 퀄리티가 향상되는데, 라이트매스가 빛이 들어오는 쪽을 향해 광선을 집중시킬 수 있기 때문입니다. (아래 왼쪽: 포탈 없음. 아래 오른쪽: 포탈 있음.)

![image alt text](image_25.png)(w:640 convert:false)

라이트매스 퀄리티의 퀄리티 향상 내용은 그 외에도 여럿 있습니다:

* 포인트 / 스포트 / 디렉셔널 라이트와 Static Lighting Level Scale 값이 작을 때의 빛샘 부작용 현상을 수정했습니다.

* 스카이 라이트 간접광이 개선되었습니다.

## 신규: 메시에서의 복사를 통한 애니메이션 포즈

애니메이션 그래프 내 스켈레탈 메시 컴포넌트간 포즈를 복사하는 애니메이션 노드를 새로 추가했습니다. Master Pose Component 의 강화 버전인데, 새로운 애니메이션과 소스 애니메이션 블렌딩이 가능하기 때문입니다.

![image alt text](image_26.gif)(convert:false)

위 예제에서, 건틀렛은 자체 애님 블루프린트에서 Copy Mesh Pose 노드를 사용하여 여자 캐릭터인 소스 메시의 손과 팔 트랜스폼 정보를 복사해 옵니다. 동시에 건틀렛의 스파이크는 독립 애니메이션이 적용됩니다.

![image alt text](image_27.png)

다른 메시 컴포넌트에서 포즈를 복사하도는 소스 메시를 설정했습니다. 본 이름이 일치하는 곳의 트랜스폼 정보만 복사해 옵니다. 노드에서 포즈를 구해 오면, 다른 애니메이션을 블렌딩해 넣을 수 있습니다.

소스 메시 애니메이션은 타깃보다 앞서 일어나야 하는데, 타깃이 소스에 붙을 때 자동으로 일어나며, 조인트 이름이 일치해야 합니다. 또한 본 트랜스폼 정보는 피직스 시뮬레이션에 *앞서* 복사되므로, 소스 메시 시뮬레이션이 있는 경우 작동하지 않습니다. 타깃 메시 애니메이션이 피직스 실행 *이후* 일어나는 경우 문제가 되지 않기는 합니다.

## 신규: LOD 본 감소 툴

이제 스켈레탈 메시 LOD 에서 **본 제거** 가 가능합니다. 스켈레탈 웨이팅이 자동으로 업데이트됩니다! 게임의 캐릭터 애니메이션 퍼포먼스를 쉽게 향상시킬 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_28.png)

**스켈레톤 트리** 의 우클릭 메뉴에 새로 생긴 '자손 제거' 옵션을 사용하여 특정 LOD 의 본을 끄시면 됩니다.

![image alt text](image_29.png)

기존에 이 부분은 메시 감소 툴과 밀접하게 결합되어 있었습니다. 이제 본을 제거하고자 하는 LOD 를 확인한 상태에서, 원하는 조인트를 선택한 뒤, 원한다면 그 자손까지 제거 가능합니다. 현재 LOD 에서만 제거할지, 아니면 하위 LOD 전부를 포함시킬지 선택하는 옵션도 있습니다.

본을 제거한 후에는 회색으로 변하여 현재 LOD 에서 스킨이 입혀지지 않았음을 나타냅니다. 페르소나의 LOD 프리뷰 모드에서도 본 비활성화시 이름이 회색으로 표시됩니다.

마지막으로, 스켈레톤 트리 툴바의 **LOD 본** 표시 옵션 드롭다운이 새로 생겨 어떤 본을 표시할지 필터링할 수 있습니다.

## 신규: 파티클 컷아웃 (빠른 플립북 파티클 렌더링)

Particle Cutouts (파티클 컷아웃)으로 플립북 파티클 렌더링이 세 배나 빨라졌습니다!

플립북 애니메이션(Sub-UV 애니메이션 모듈)을 사용하는 파티클은 낭비되는 오버드로가 꽤 발생하는 경향이 있습니다 - 픽셀 셰이더를 실행시켜야 하나, 최종 오파시티는 0 인 곳이 그랬습니다. 예를 들어 아래 텍스처는 거의 반투명 픽셀로 구성되어 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_31.png)

이제 보이지 않는 영역은 컷아웃(잘라내기)하고, 바운딩 지오메트리가 훨씬 꼭 맞는 파티클을 렌더링할 수 있게되어, 애니메이션 몇 프레임 재생중인지와 관계 없이 전체 쿼드를 사용하지 않아도 됩니다.

![image alt text](image_32.png)

### 구성

엔진에서는 기본적으로 파티클 컷아웃을 사용할 수 없는데, 머티리얼 그래프는 텍스처에서 오지 않을 수도 있는 파티클의 오파시티를 생성하는 로직을 허용하기 때문입니다. 파티클 컷아웃을 사용하려면 아티스트가 직접 구성을 해 줘야 합니다.

1. (콘텐츠 브라우저에서 텍스처에 우클릭하여) 플립북 텍스처에서 'SubUV 애니메이션' 애셋을 새로 만듭니다.

![image alt text](image_33.png)

2. 'SubUV 애니메이션' 애셋을 열어 Sub Images 프로퍼티가 제대로 설정되었는지 확인합니다. 플립북 텍스처마다 이 처음의 두 단계는 한 번만 해 주면 됩니다.

![image alt text](image_34.png)

3. 캐스케이드에서, SubUV 모듈을 찾은 다음 애니메이션 애셋을 할당합니다.

![image alt text](image_35.png)

### 퍼포먼스 결과

![image alt text](image_36.png)

셰이더 복잡도 뷰모드에서 보면 컷아웃을 사용했을 때 파티클 시스템의 오버드로가 훨씬 적습니다. 컷아웃 지오메트리를 사용하니 파티클 시스템의 GPU 비용이 **1/2 에서 1/3** 수준으로 절감되었습니다!

## 신규: 버텍스별 반투명 라이팅

라이팅된 반투명은 이제 새로 생긴 **버텍스별** 반투명 라이팅 세팅을 사용하여 **훨씬 빠르게 렌더링** 가능합니다!

![image alt text](image_37.png)(convert:false)

머티리얼 에디터에는 라이팅을 버텍스별로 계산하는 반투명 라이팅 모드가 둘 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_38.png)

* 버텍스별 라이팅 모드는 텍스처 룩업과 **셰이더 인스트럭션을 절반만** 사용합니다.

* "Volumetric PerVertex NonDirectional" 세팅은 매우 빠릅니다 - 거의 라이팅제외 머티리얼과 비슷합니다.

* 가급적 버텍스별 반투명 라이팅을 사용하실 것을 권합니다. 매우 커다란 파티클이나 트라이앵글은 예외인데, 라이팅이 각 트라이앵글을 거치면서 보간되기 때문입니다.

## 신규: 라이팅 채널

라이팅 채널은 다이내믹 라이트가 **라이팅 채널이 겹치는 오브젝트에만** 영향을 끼치도록 할 수 있습니다. 이제 **최대 3 개의 라이팅 채널** 을 지원합니다.

![image alt text](image_39.png)

프리미티브 컴포넌트나 라이트 컴포넌트가 어느 채널에 들어있는지 설정할 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_40.png)

* 시네마틱에 정말 유용합니다! 예를 들면, 주변 환경에는 영향을 끼치지 않는 림 라이트같은 것입니다.

* 라이팅 채널 영향은 동적으로 적용됩니다 - 즉 스태틱 라이트와는 작동하지 않으며, 그러한 경우에는 스테이셔너리 또는 무버블 라이트를 사용해야 합니다. 또한, 라이팅 채널은 불투명 머티리얼의 직사광에만 영향을 끼칩니다.

* 라이팅 채널 사용시 라이트당 약간의 GPU 비용만 추가됩니다.

* 참고로 이 부분은 디퍼드 렌더링에만 적용 가능하므로, SM5 나 Metal 을 사용하지 않는 모바일 또는 Mac 에서는 쓸 수 없을 것입니다.

## 신규: 스테레오 공간화

이제 PC, Xbox One, PS4 플랫폼에서 **스테레오 애셋** 이 **3D 공간화** 를 지원합니다. 스테레오 공간화는 본질적으로 각 입력 소스 (예로 좌우) 채널을 모노 소스인 양 공간화시킵니다. 왼쪽과 오른쪽 채널은 사운드 어테뉴에이션 세팅에 새로 생긴 3D Stereo Spread (스테레오 퍼짐) 옵션을 통해 이미터 위치 오프셋으로 결정됩니다.

![image alt text](image_41.png)

3D 스테레오 퍼짐 파라미터는 좌우 채널과 청자 이미터 벡터에 수직인 벡터 사이의 거리를 게임 유닛 단위로 정의합니다. 즉 스테레오 채널 퍼짐 파라미터는 월드 좌표계에 있으며, 청자가 이미터에게서 멀리 있을 수록 (좌우 채널이 합쳐져) 자연히 모노 점 소스로 수렴된다는 뜻입니다.

![image alt text](image_42.png)

## 신규: 사운드 포커스

사운드 어테뉴에이션 세팅 애셋은 이제 **사운드 포커스** 를 지원합니다. 이를 통해 사운드 디자이너는 청자와 사운드의 상대적 방향을 기준으로 하여 여러가지 파라미터를 자동으로 제어하도록 할 수 있습니다.

다음 도표는 방위각 세팅을 나타냅니다:

![image alt text](image_43.png)

사운드 디자이너는 사운드 포커스 인 / 아웃 시점을 방위각 값으로 지정합니다. 이 방위각 사이의 상대 사운드 위치는 각 지역을 블렌딩하도록 보간됩니다. 이 세팅은 사운드 어테뉴에이션 세팅 UStruct 에서 지정합니다:

![image alt text](image_44.png)

포커스 & 논포커스 값은 사운드를 Distance Scaling (거리 스케일), Volume Scaling (볼륨 스케일), Priority Scaling (우선권 스케일), 총 세 가지 방법으로 변경시킵니다. 거리 스케일은 포커스 인/아웃 된 소리가 들리는 거리의 스케일을 조절하여 폭파 또는 줌 효과를 내는 데 좋습니다. 볼륨 스케일은 가시 여부에 따라 사운드에 또다른 감쇠를 추가하고자 할 때 사용할 수 있습니다. 우선권 스케일은 사운드 동시재생 관련해서 우선권을 감소 (또는 증가)시킬 때 사용됩니다.

## 신규: 사운드 오클루전

UE4 는 이제 단순한 레이캐스트 기반 사운드 오클루전을 지원합니다. 사운드에 대한 오클루전 계산을 켜려면, 다음 그림과 같이 사운드 어테뉴에이션 세팅 애셋에 지정해 주기만 하면 됩니다:

![image alt text](image_45.png)

사운드 어테뉴에이션 오브젝트에 오클루전이 활성화되면, 해당 오브젝트를 가지고 플레이되는 사운드는 콜리전 지오메트리를 대상으로 레이캐스트를 수행하여 사운드 차폐 여부를 알아냅니다. 사운드가 차폐되었다면, 주어진 Low Pass Filter Frequency 값과 볼륨 감쇠를 적용합니다. 오클루전 시스템은 이진 (차폐 되거나 안되거나) 레이캐스트를 기반이기에, 옵션으로 제공되는 차폐 보간 시간에 걸쳐 미차폐 상태에서 차폐 빈도 값으로 보간해 들어갑니다. 복잡한 지오메트리에 대한 콜리전 검사를 켜는 옵션 체크박스가 제공됩니다.

## 신규: 사운드 컨커런시

새로운 컨커런시 (동시재생) 시스템은 사운드 인스턴스에서 동시재생 데이터를 제거한 뒤 별도의 애셋에 집어넣습니다. 콘텐츠 브라우저의 "새 애셋" 메뉴 아래 **Sound Concurrency** (사운드 컨커런시)를 선택하면 됩니다.

기존 Max Count (최대 카운트)와 Resolution Rule (개석 규칙)에 추가로, 사운드 컨커런시 오브젝트에는 몇 가지 동시재생 관련 부가기능이 있는데, 다음과 같습니다.

**Limit To Owner** 오너에 제한

이 컨커런시로 재생되는 사운드는 사운드의 오너와 함께 컨커런시 카운트를 해야 함을 나타내는 데 쓰입니다. 사운드 오너가 없는 경우 (즉 오디오 컴포넌트를 통해서 또는 액터에서 재생되지 않는 경우), 체크박스가 체크되지 않은 것처럼 컨커런시 카운트를 합니다. 액터별로 동시재생 제한을 둘 수 있도록 하기 위한 의도입니다.

**Volume Scale** 볼륨 스케일

이 기능은 다수의 사운드를 볼륨 관리를 위한 컨커런시 그룹에 묶습니다. 하나의 컨커런시 그룹에 있는 다수의 사운드가 동시에 재생될 때, 이전 사운드는 조용해 집니다. 이 기능 하의 사운드 볼륨 스케일 공식은 다음과 같습니다:

VolumeScale = VolumeScaleSettingNewerSoundCount

*VolumeScaleSetting* 은 사용자가 설정하는 값이고, *NewerSoundCount* 는 이것 다음에 시작된 동시재생 그룹 내 현재 재생중인 사운드 갯수입니다. 예를 들어 사운드 A, B, C 가 같은 동시재생 그룹에 있고 *VolumeScaleSetting* 이 0.9 인 상태로 빠르게 연속 재생되는 경우, 다음과 같이 조정됩니다:

A 의 VolumeScale = (0.9)2 = 0.81

B 의 VolumeScale = (0.9)1 = 0.9

C 의 VolumeScale = (0.9)0 = 1.0

다른 말로 가장 최근 사운드는 영향받지 않으나, 한 단계씩 전으로 거슬러 올라갈 때마다 볼륨이 급수적으로 줄어, 사실상 같은 그룹의 사운드에 대한 자동 더킹 메카니즘 역할을 합니다.

**새 해석 규칙: 최하 우선권 중지, 최하 볼륨 중지**

새로운 컨커런시 오브젝트에는 컨커런시 해석 규칙이 Stop Lowest Priority (최하 우선권 중지)와 Stop Quietest (최하 볼륨 중지), 두 가지가 추가되었습니다.

최하 우선권 중지 규칙은 (사운드 큐, 사운드 웨이브 등의) USoundBase 오브젝트에 설정된 우선권 값을 사용합니다. 컨커런시 그룹의 한계에 도달하면, 그룹 내 모든 활성 사운드를 대상으로 하여 우선권이 가장 낮은 사운드 재생을 중지합니다 (, 또는 새로운 사운드가 우선권이 가장 낮은 경우 재생하지 않습니다).

최하 볼륨 중지 규칙은 이름 그대로입니다: 거리에 따라 (보통은 볼륨에 상관 관계가 있지만, 아닌 경우도 있으므로) 중지하는 대신, 그룹 내 가장 볼륨이 낮은 사운드 재생을 중지합니다 (, 또는 새로운 사운드가 볼륨이 가장 낮은 경우 재생하지 않습니다). 볼륨이 가장 낮은 사운드라 함은, 사운드 gain 단계 계산 이후 전체적인 볼륨 결과물이 가장 작은 사운드를 말합니다.

**사운드에 사운드 컨커런시 오브젝트 적용**

사운드 컨커런시 오브젝트를 사용하려면, 그저 사운드 어테뉴에이션 세팅 오브젝트를 사용할 때와 마찬가지로 방식으로 사운드 오브젝트나 사운드 콜에 제공해 주기만 하면 됩니다. 아래는 사운드 웨이브 애셋의 디테일 패널입니다.

![image alt text](image_46.png)

위에 강조된 부분인 추가 섹션으로 새로운 사운드 컨커런시 애셋으로의 애셋 레퍼런스를 끌어놓을 수 있습니다.

**사운드 컨커런시 덮어쓰기**

하위 호환성과 아울러 이전 동작을 선호하는 경우가 있을 수 있어서, 컨커런시 세팅 오브젝트를 애셋에 있는 데이터 로컬 세트로 덮어쓰도록 할 수 있습니다. 이러한 경우, 사운드 애셋은 자체 컨커런시 그룹이 되고 애셋 인스턴스로 동시재생을 제한시키는 이전 방식으로 작동합니다. 이전 프로젝트를 4.11 로 변환하면 자동으로 사운드 애셋에 오버라이트 세팅을 사용합니다.

## 신규: 마커 기반 애니메이션 동기화

![image alt text](image_47.png)

애니메이션은 이제 애니메이션 데이터의 **마커** 를 사용하여 **동기화** 시킬 수 있습니다. 이전 릴리즈에서 두 애니메이션을 동기화시키려면 시간을 기준으로 해서, 길이가 일치되도륵 스케일을 조절하는 방법뿐이었습니다. 이제 노티파이 트랙에 우클릭한 다음 노티파이 추가-> 새 동기화 마커 를 선택하여 마커 데이터를 추가할 수 있습니다.

초기 릴리즈 피처 세트는 다음과 같습니다:

* 동일한 SyncGroup (동기화 그룹) 내의 애니메이션만 동기화됩니다. 리더가 같은 동기화 그룹 내의 팔로워 위치를 구동시킵니다.

* 재생 속도 조정은 없으며, 재생 속도는 항상 마스터 애니메이션과 같습니다.

* 한 그룹 내 모든 애니메이션에 공통인 마커만 동기화됩니다. 예를 들어 한 애니메이션에 'Right Foot Down' 마커가 없다면, 그 마커는 해당 프레임 위치를 결정할 때 모든 애니메이션에 대해 무시될 것입니다.

* 위치는 리더와 그 공통 마커의 상대적 위치에 따라 동기화가 이루어집니다. 예를 들어, 리더가 좌우 발 마커 사이 25% 지점에 있는 경우, 팔로워는 각각의 좌우 마커 사이 25% 지점에 동기화됩니다.

* 마커 기반 동기화는 한 동기화 그룹의 애니메이션에 일치하는 마커 수가 충분할 경우 자동으로 사용됩니다. 충분치 않은 경우 원래 길이 스케일 적용 동기화 방식이 사용됩니다.

* 몽타주 역시 블렌딩 아웃 시 마커 기반 동기화를 지원하므로, 다른 애니메이션에 매끄럽게 전환해 돌아갈 수 있습니다. Montage 에서 Sync Group 세팅을 찾을 수 있습니다.

## 신규: 애니메이션 몽타주에 대한 커브 블렌딩

**몽타주** 는 이제 **커브 블렌딩** 을 지원합니다. 몽타주의 블렌드 인 & 블렌드 아웃 옵션으로 몽타주 플레이시 블렌딩을 어떻게 할 것인지 제어합니다. 참고로 재생되는 몽타주가 추가되면, 그 블렌드 인 세팅이 사용됩니다.

![image alt text](image_48.png)

## 신규: 계층형 LOD 아웃라이너

새로운 **계층형 LOD 아웃라이너** 를 통해 메시 액터의 클러스터를 시각화시켜 보면서 다양한 HLOD 세팅과 생성 프로세스를 편집할 수 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_49.png)

### 머티리얼 생성

머티리얼 병합 프로세스는 이제 버텍스별 컬러, 버텍스 위치, 버텍스 노멀 등의 머티리얼 프로퍼티를 추가 지원합니다. 월드 스페이스 텍스처링, 표면 노멀에 따른 눈이나 이끼 블렌드 인, 버텍스 컬러로 머티리얼 레이어 마스크 적용과 같은 작업이 HLOD 에도 가능합니다.

픽셀별 노멀이나 월드-탄젠트 트랜스폼같은 기능은 아직 지원되지 않습니다. 그러한 경우, 또는 HLOD 에 다양한 또는 단순화된 머티리얼을 사용하고자 하는 경우, **Material Proxy Replace** 노드를 사용하면 됩니다. **Lightmass Replace** 노드처럼 사용됩니다: "실시간" 입력이 실행시간에 사용되고, "머티리얼 프록시" 입력은 생성 프로세스 도중에만 사용됩니다.

머티리얼 병합 프로세스에 대한 세팅은 이제 **월드 세팅** 패널뿐 아니라 **HLOD 아웃라이너** 패널에서도 찾을 수 있습니다.

### 프록시 메시 생성

프록시 메시 생성 효율이 높아지고 Simplygon SDK 최신 버전이 통합되어, 메시 생성 프로세스에 대한 세팅은 이제 HLOD 아웃라이너 패널에서도 찾을 수 있습니다.

기타 개선사항:

* 스플라인 메시가 이제 HLOD 시스템에 지원됩니다.

* 프록시 메시/클러스터는 이제 보이는 (서브)레벨에 대해서면 표시, 생성, 빌드됩니다.

* 이미시브 컬러가 이제 머티리얼 병합 프로세스에 지원됩니다.

* 불투명 머티리얼이 있는 스태틱 메시가 이제 머티리얼 병합 프로세스에 지원됩니다.

## 신규: 복잡한 텍스트 렌더링 (실험단계)

슬레이트에 **우에서 좌**, **양방향** 텍스트 지원은 물론, (아랍어 같은) 복잡한 모양 텍스트 지원 작업도 추가하고 있습니다.

![image alt text](image_50.png)

이 기능은 아직 극초기 단계입니다. 이번 릴리즈에 나간 부분은 약간 다듬어져 있을테지만, 그래도 확인해 보시고 피드백 주시면 감사하겠습니다.

알려진 문제점:

* 한줄 편집가능 텍스트 블록은 현재 복잡한 텍스트에 작동하지 않습니다 (여러줄 텍스트, 고정된 플레인/리치 텍스트만 가능).

* Text Actor 또는 Canvas 가 지원되지 않습니다.

* 복잡한 텍스트 렌더링은 현재 Windows, Mac, PS4 빌드에서만 사용할 수 있습니다.

## 신규: 고급 블루프린트 검색

블루프린트 검색 툴이 업데이트, 보다 고급의 검색 기능을 지원합니다 (검색 대상 범위를 더욱 좁힐 수 있습니다).

![image alt text](image_51.png)

* 이제 검색시 대상 요소를 노드, 핀, 그래프, 함수, 매크로, 변수, 프로퍼티, 컴포넌트 등으로 지정할 수 있습니다. 자세한 문서는 이 곳을 참고해 주십시오: [](Engine/Blueprints/Search)

* And (&&) 와 Or (||) 논리 연산자, 추가로 Tag/Value 일치도 지원합니다 (문법: Tag=Value).

* 변수의 "레퍼런스 찾기" 옵션이 이제 향상된 함수성을 활용하여 보다 정교한 검색이 가능해졌습니다.

## 신규: VR 머리 장착 디스플레이 카메라 개선사항

머리 장착 디스플레이(HMD)의 카메라 시스템에 리팩터링 작업을 하여 활용도를 높이고 사용하기 쉽게 만들었습니다. 현실에서 헤드셋이 원점에서 오프셋이 적용되는 것과 같은 원리로, 엔진에서도 활성 카메라 컴포넌트에 오프셋을 적용하도록 했습니다. 즉 월드의 VR 헤드셋 위치 계산이 쉬워지고, 메시나 기타 오브젝트 직접 부착할 수 있으며, VR 게임 조작 방식을 단순화시킬 수 있게 되었습니다.

추가로 카메라 컴포넌트에 붙은 것이면 무엇이든 "늦게 업데이트" 되어, 렌더링 가능성이 있는 위치 데이터는 가장 최신의 것을 사용하여 지연시간을 줄입니다. 카메라에 붙은 메시, 이펙트, 스프라이트는 입체 상태로 고정되며, HMD 자체를 업데이트하는 것과 같은 방식으로 매 프레임 업데이트합니다.

현재 프로젝트에 새로운 시스템을 사용할 수 있도록 이주시키는 법에 대한 정보는 [](Platforms/VR/VRCameraRefactor) 문서를 참고하시기 바랍니다.

## 신규: VR 스테레오 레이어

Stereo Layers (스테레오 레이어)는 VR 컴포지터에 직접 물려지는 별도의 레이어에다 월드 내 어느 위치에 있는 텍스처 포함 쿼드를 그릴 수 있습니다. 이를 통해 왜곡이 줄어 UI 가독성이 향상됩니다. 현재, 이 기능은 Oculus Rift 헤드셋에만 구현되어 있으며, 다른 플랫폼에도 곧 적용될 예정입니다!

## 신규: 시퀀서 주요 진행상황 (실험단계)

Sequencer (시퀀서), 비선형 시네마틱 애니메이션 시스템이 새로 등장했습니다. 시퀀서는 아직 활발히 개발중이며, 아직은 제작 단계에서 사용할 만 하지는 못합니다만, 먼저 시도해 보시고 피드백 주실 수 있으면 대단히 감사하겠습니다! 앞으로의 UE4 릴리즈 버전에서 시퀀서 관련 소식을 더욱 많이 준비하겠습니다.

4.11 에서 시퀀서 관련 주목할 만한 신기능:

* 새 트랙 추가: 샷/디렉터, 재생 속도, 슬로모, 페이드, 머티리얼, 파티클 파라미터 트랙.

* 무비 렌더링 개선: .EXR 렌더링 지원.

* 키프레임 방식 개선, 키프레임 복사/붙여넣기, 마티네에서 키 복사, 3D 키프레임 경로 표시.

* 마스터 시퀀스 작업방식으로, 다수의 서브씬으로 거대한 시퀀스 구성.

* "스포너블" (시네마틱 애셋 내에 존재하는 액터) 지원.

* UI 개선: 트랙 착색, 키프레임 모양/착색, 트랙 필터링.

플러그인 패널을 열고 Level Sequence Editor (레벨 시퀀스 에디터) 플러그인을 켠 뒤 에디터를 재시작하면 시퀀서를 켤 수 있습니다.

* Bugfix: Corrected HitNormal values reported by navmesh raycasts.

* Bugfix: Fixed the influence of navmesh edges on crowd simulation near the ends of paths.

* Bugfix: Navigation export of destructible mesh without collisions enabled now works as expected.

* Bugfix: Fixed navigation export of NavRelevantComponent attached to an actor not affecting navmesh generation.

* Bugfix: Navmesh tiles are no longer drawn in red, or not drawn at all, after navmesh generation finishes.

* Bugfix: Reuse of navigation paths now updates all flags appropriately.

* Bugfix: Corrected scoring of navmesh boundary segments in detour's crowd simulation.

* Bugfix: Fixed UNavRelevantComponent not being included in navmesh generation when it's not attached to actor with collision component.

* Navmesh raycast will use nearest poly containing ray origin instead of just closest one.

* Added Z check to detour's crowd avoidance segment gathering.

* RVO avoidance now takes the height of agents into account when culling obstacles.

### Animation

* **New: Level-of-Detail Threshold for Animation Graphs**

    * Many animation graph nodes now have an **LOD Threshold **option for **performance optimization**:

        * Apply Additive

        * Apply Mesh Additive

        * Aim Offset

        * All Skeletal Control nodes

    * Whenever the Skeletal Mesh instance drops below this LOD, the node will not execute.

![image alt text](image_52.png)

* **New: Per-Animation **Compression** Settings

    * You can now set **animation compression **on a **per-animation** basis. 

![image alt text](image_53.png)

* Choosing *Automatic* and then pressing *Apply* will cause the engine to determine the best setting (based on error metrics) and set that for you.

* New: Added "Delete All" option to anim curve panel.

* New: Added a new property called "Min Time Between Ticks" to particle systems. This can be used to force a lower tick rate on a particle system by specifying the minimum number of milliseconds between ticks.

* New: Added a new role for sync group members: TransitionLeader. It is excluded from the group while it blends in. Once it reaches full weight it becomes leader until it is fully blended out again.

* New: Added AssetRegistrySearchable tag to AnimSequence's EnableRootMotion property so that it shows in the content browser.

* New: Added blend profiles to skeleton assets, which allow per-bone multipliers when using blend per bone or other blending nodes.

    * These are accessible from the skeleton tree pane in Persona.

![image alt text](image_54.png)

* New: Added DrawCanvas and viewport string support to skeletal controls to enable them to output debug information to the viewport.

    * This feature can be enabled using the Show -> Display -> Skeletal Controls option in Persona's viewport,

* New: Added a flag to animation evaluator nodes so users can set whether they should loop when being ticked.

    * With the addition of Marker Based sync, evaluator nodes now have the ability to be ticked like sequence players (by adding them to a sync group). 

    * By default, the evaluator node's playing direction will be forward or backward based on whether the target time is earlier or later than the current time.

    * With the loop flag enabled the playing direction will be based on whichever direction will reach the target animation time more quickly. For example, going from 4.9 seconds to 0.1 seconds in a 5 second animation will play forward and loop instead of playing backward.

* New: Added GetCurrentStateName as a blueprint-accessible function on animation instances.

* New: Added a "Random Player" node for anim graphs. With this node, the user can play a selection of animations in a random order with certain randomized parameters. With Random Player, "Shuffle Mode" acts more like a randomized playlist, in that it will play everything on the list before repeating.

* New: Added SetMinLOD and SetForcedLOD functions. These enable the user to restrict LODs for the a specific SkeletalMeshComponent.

    * For example, calling SetMinLOD with 1 will mean that the component will not use LOD 0, even if it gets close to the camera, but it can use LODs 1 and higher as it normally would.

    * Similarly, calling SetForcedLOD with 0 will force the component to use only LOD 0 all the time. This can be useful for ensuring that the local player's character is always at maximum quality.

    * If both functions are used, SetForcedLOD will override SetMinLOD.

* New: Added support to tie update rate optimization directly to LOD level instead of selecting the amount based on screen size.

* New: Added a "Start Position" to the player node. The Sequence Player and BlendSpace Player both contain the Start Position parameter, which will start the animation at the given position on the first time it plays.

* New: Added support for space conversion in the copy-bone skeletal controller node.

* New: Added support to PoseableMeshComponents for the MasterPoseComponent property.

* New: Added the ability to remap to existing assets when retargeting in Persona.

    * Persona can also attempt to auto fill the correct assets if the source and destination assets use a similar naming scheme.

* New: Allow users to change animation compression settings per animation in the detail panel.

    * Note that you'll have to click "Apply" to apply to the current compressed data. If not, data will not match the displayed compression setting.

    * Default compression settings are in Project/Animation.

    * An automatic setting exists. This may take a while, as it will try all possible configurations and compare results, but it will find the optimal compression settings.

* New: Anim Montage now contains FAlphaBlend BlendIn/BlendOut option

    * Supports both preset and custom curve types.

* New: Blend List node now supports Reset Child On Activation for reinitialization when reactivated.

### Audio

* New: Improved Gameplay Statics sound API.

    * New Spawn at Location functions return an Audio Component that allows manipulation of the played sound similar to the Attached version.

    * Play at Location still does not return the audio component and should be used for one-shot sounds.

    * Rotation added to Location and Attached API to allow facing to be specified to work properly with non-spherical attenuation shapes.

* New: Sound attenuation boundaries match the attenuation curves at min/max.

* New: Sound attenuation values match attenuation curves at min and max rather than assuming 1.0 or 0.0 respectively.

    * This allows for more unusual distance-based attenuation curves, such as donut-shaped curves, or curves that cause audio to be loud far away but quiet nearby.

* New: Support for playing sounds with audio component properties without needing an audio component as long as the sound's properties do not change.

* New: XAudio2 voices for PC/XBoxOne platforms are pooled and reused.

* New: Volume-weight voice prioritization sorting for active voices.

### Blueprints

* **New: Blueprint "Development Only" Functions**

    * Native C++ functions marked *BlueprintCallable* can now also be optionally marked as *DevelopmentOnly*. This new metadata allows calls to those functions to be disabled (compiled out) of all Blueprint function graphs in cooked/packaged builds without breaking the execution flow. ![image alt text](image_55.png)

* The *PrintString* and *PrintText* system library functions have now been marked *DevelopmentOnly* by default. This allows for a quick removal of Blueprint logging in the final build product.

* To get packaged/cooked Blueprints to compile without the "*DevelopmentOnly*"nodes, disable the "Compile Blueprints in Development Mode" option found in the project's Cooker settings (this option is on by default to preserve functionality).

* **New: Condensed Blueprint Struct Nodes**

    * We've improved and refined usability for structs that contain toggle values that are conceptually linked to other property "settings" in the same struct (like how our PostProcessSettings struct operates). ![image alt text](image_56.png)

* Different override/enabled states are now managed through a toggle or dropdown widget that is exposed along with the setting on "Make Struct" and "Set Member" nodes.

* To associate a toggle variable with another property, use the "*EditCondition*" metadata like is pictured above.

* New: Added support to AsyncTask nodes so that their corresponding functions can return null.

* New: Added the ability to mark BlueprintCallable functions as development only.

    * By default, these nodes will be compiled out of Blueprint class function graphs at cook/package time, potentially improving runtime performance.

    * The "Print String" and "Print Text" functions are now marked as development-only, and will not be executed at runtime in cooked builds by default.

* New: Added configurable threshold settings for fps/frame time displays.

    * t.TargetFrameTimeThreshold and t.UnacceptableFrameTimeThreshold set the thresholds (in ms, defaulting to 33.9 and 50.0, respectively).

    * Values below the target level are green, values above the unacceptable level are red, and the ones in between are yellow.

    * The bar for on-screen cycle counters is now based on t.TargetFrameTimeThreshold rather than a hardcoded 33.3 ms.

    * t.HitchFrameTimeThreshold is the definition of a hitchy frame (in ms), defaulting to 60 ms.

    * t.HitchDeadTimeWindow is the minimum time that must pass before we'll record a new hitch (in ms), defaulting to 200 ms.

    * t.HitchVersusNonHitchRatio is the minimum ratio between the last frame time and the current frame time to consider it a hitch, defaulting to 1.5 (e.g., if the last frame time was 50, the current frame must be at least 75 to be considered a hitch).

    * They can also be set in the [SystemSettings] section of DefaultEngine.ini for games that target something other than 30 fps.

    * Switched 'stat hitches' display to use the t.HitchFrameTimeThreshold value, and updated coloring to use the related coloring thresholds (at 25% of the hitch value) instead of using hardcoded yellow at 100 ms and red at 200 ms.

* New: The auto-save feature has been revamped and now functions as intended. It will wait for a small period of inactivity prior to operating, so as not to intrusively interrupt the user's workflow.

* New: The light complexity view mode now has improved, more readable color coding. The color per number of lights are configured in BaseEngine.ini under Light Complexity Colors.

* New: The process of duplicating Brushes in the editor has now been hugely optimized.

* Bugfix: Clicking the clear button on the SearchBox widget will no longer close the parent menu (this was affecting context menus in the Blueprint / Material editors amongst others).

* Made a number of substantial optimizations and improvements to Mesh Paint mode. This addresses very poor performance when vertex painting on spline meshes or static meshes with a large number of vertices, and also addresses an issue of gradual slowdown when left in Paint Mode for a while.

* Added automatic fixup code on load for brushes that were mirrored (which could have resulted in inverted/invalid collision).

#### Content Browser

* New: Added a prototype content browser search filter for assets that use a specific gameplay tag.

    * Note: The filter currently only shows matching assets that are already loaded, it will not discover tag usage in an unloaded asset!

* New: Added a way to forcibly refresh the source control status of a collection.

* New: Improved the asset gathering and path prioritization workflow for very large projects.

    * Previously, the file discovery phase of the asset gathering process would block the entire process until it had found all of the files it needed to test.

    * This can take quite some time for projects with a large amount of assets, so this change adjusts the process so that discovered paths will be reported back to the asset registry while the file discovery is on-going. This allows you to prioritize the scanning of certain folders before the initial discovery phase has finished.

* New: Reinstated Thumbnail Edit Mode Primitive Tools. Now the mesh used by the Content Browser when editing thumbnails can be changed.

* New: Removed the UCurve derived asset types from the Create Asset menu in the Content Browser, while still presenting the option to create them as new assets in the asset picker dropdown menu in details panels.

* Modified DDS cubemap loading to prevent an array overflow when importing a cubemap with too many mips.

* Moving assets now corrects source reimport paths where possible

* Some performance improvements when opening the Content Browser

#### Landscape

* New: Added a new Landscape Layer Usage visualization mode. This allows you to easily see and optimize which landscape components are using which layers to improve performance.

    * Each layer has a color code which can be chosen by clicking on the layer thumbnail while the Layer Usage visualization mode is active.

    * Each landscape component renders a stripe pattern across the entire component. The stripe is made up of the color codes for the layers that are applied to the component.

* New: Added layer whitelisting by component to the landscape editor

    * Enabled via the layer restriction dropdown in paint mode

    * The brush will go red in areas that aren't whitelisted and will block painting

    * Hold the main keyboard +/- and click to add/remove layers from the whitelist (not the numpad, the ones next to backspace)

    * Warning: Removing a layer from components with "-" + click will also delete that layer's painted data on those components

* New: Landscape can now have "world position offset" from the landscape material baked into its collision

    * This feature is experimental and currently has the following restrictions:

        * Only z (vertical) offset is supported. XY offsets are ignored.

        * Does not work with CollisionMipLevel > 0

        * Does not work with an XY offset map (from retopologize tool)

* Bugfix: Landscape editor did not show layers that were only defined inside a Material Function used by the landscape material, and not the landscape material itself.

* Bugfix: Fixed black spot / hole if all layers on a component use height blending and add to <= 0

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in LowPassFilter when landscape smoothing brush is used with bDetailSmooth set and a very small brush size

* Bugfix: There was a crash in the landscape ramp and mirror tools if the streaming level containing the landscape is hidden (or possibly if the landscape actor is deleted)

    * Also hardened the landscape spline tool, although I don't believe it was crashing it could still try to render for a frame after the landscape was hidden/destroyed.

* Bugfix: Fixed hiding a streaming level containing a landscape causing the landscape editor to switch to the "New Landscape" tool instead of exiting

* Bugfix: Can now import landscapes over 8161 verts in size

* Bugfix: Landscape would become offset and have corrupted blend weights when using the "change component size" tool if an edge row/column of landscape components had been deleted

* Bugfix: Landscape component resize tool moved the landscape into the persistent level, and crashing if the persistent level was hidden

* Bugfix: Landscape material instances were not being updated if holes are painted on a landscape that doesn't have the landscape visibility mask node in the material and then the visibility mask node is added to the material later

* Bugfix: Landscape sculpting with a brush below a certain size and strength was not having any effect

* Bugfix: Landscape smooth tool was doing strange things near cliffs

* Bugfix: Various landscape editor materials (e.g. brushes) being easily obscured by grass or world-position-offset effects in the landscape material

* Improved handling of erasing painted landscape layers

    * Erasing is now possible on vertices 100% painted with one layer, it will now fill with the next most dominant layer on the component

    * Note: Erasing is still impossible on components which are entirely painted with only a single layer - where there is _no_ next most dominant layer on that component

* Bugfix: More robust handling for landscape editor missing the "mouse up" message and getting stuck or crashing

#### Material Editor

* New: Comment nodes added in the Material Editor now start with the focus on the editable text.

* New: Landscape Layer Blend now works with Material Attributes

* New: Material inputs are now greyed based on translucency lighting mode

* New: Removed duplicate entries in the list of Material Functions for the Material Editor right-click context menu.

* Bugfix: Corrected an issue with the Material Editor constantly updating node titles while a details slider is moved, leading to flickering.

* Bugfix: Crash when selecting a vector and a scalar parameter in the Material Editor at the same time.

* Bugfix: A group of material nodes containing a MaterialFunctionCall node would lose their connections when copy+pasted.

* Bugfix: Changing a texture's Texture Group was not causing any dependent materials to be refreshed.

* Bugfix: Fixed material errors using Custom nodes with LandscapeGrassOutput or other CustomOutput node types.

* Bugfix: Parameters connected to LandscapeGrass or other CustomOutput nodes were not appearing in the Material Instance Constant editor

#### Matinee

* Bugfix: The editor would hang when performing a viewport camera transition (by pressing F) while Matinee has a locked actor defined.

* Bugfix: Movie scene captures where hardware mapped surfaces to memory of a different stride to the render target is fixed

* Bugfix: Matinee audio tracks now properly start at the correct point when scrubbing.

* Bugfix: Sound now correctly restarts in matinee preview when jumping back along timeline after reaching end.

#### Cascade

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that could cause a crash when exporting an emitter

#### Persona

* New: Simplygon Reduction tool

    * Fixed so that you only apply your reduction setting to certain LOD only

    * Fixed so that it does regenerate with the setting that was there before.

    * Fixed so that it warns the users if you'd like to reduce mesh for imported mesh

    * Now displays in the material section if generated.

    * Allow BaseLOD to change - for example if you want to generate simplygon from LOD 1, you can using BaseLOD.

* Bugfix: Fix for SkeletalMesh section highlighting when number of mesh materials is smaller than number of sections.

* Bugfix: Crash in Persona when undoing duplication of state nodes.

* Bugfix: Multiple crashes and instances of incorrect behavior fixed when undoing and redoing repeatedly while editing state machines.

* Bugfix: Crash on undo when changing child animation blueprint overrides.

* Bugfix: Crash when editing details of an animation object and losing focus to another window.

* Bugfix: Crash when undoing changes to a socket property in a notify

* Bugfix: Mesh reduction tool bugs resolved

    * Fixed so that it keeps the ScreenSize set before for the regenerated mesh reduction

    * Fixed so that materials created by Simplygon are to be assigned

* Bugfix: Persona and PHaT viewport client can now handle changes in translucency when drawing physics constraints

* Bugfix: The playrate in Persona will use the viewport worlds time dilation instead of managing time dilation separately

#### Static Mesh Editor

* New: Cancelling at the prompt to change LOD Group in the Static Mesh Editor now no longer changes the LOD group.

* New: Added feature to visually isolate meshes by material

    * Enabled via the 'Isolate' checkbox in the details panel for each material section (below Highlight option)

    * Resets when closing the Static Mesh Editor

* Bugfix: Added code to restore the section info that is cached when reimporting a mesh so LOD section information is not lost on reimport.

* Bugfix: Crash in Auto Convex Collision tool with very small or flat meshes.

* Bugfix: 'Focus Viewport to Selection' in the Static Mesh Editor works properly now.

#### Source Control

* New: If the assigned diff tool cannot be launched when diffing assets, the user is offered an opportunity to set a new default one.

* New: Added SSL support to Perforce libraries for Visual Studio 2015.

* Bugfix: Crash when submitting assets to source control

    * FEditorFileUtils::FindAllSubmittablePackageFiles now uses FPackageName::TryConvertFilenameToLongPackageName to avoid a crash if it finds a bad package path

* Bugfix: Regression where packages were no longer notifying the user that they needed checkout (or were no longer being automatically checked out) when dirtied.

* Bugfix: Assets pending delete were sometimes not showing up in the list of files to commit.

* Bugfix: An issue where assets under SVN which had been made writable continually prompted the user for checkout when saving.

* Bugfix: Git Plugin can find the git.exe binary installed on the Local AppData user directory 

* Bugfix: User*.ini configuration files are now excluded from source control submission.

#### World Browser

* New: Added the facility to find levels in the content browser from the Level Editor Levels submenu, and in the World Browser context menu.

* Fixed: Reduntant seek for world composition related data inside level package in a cooked builds

* Fixed: World origin offset handling for UInterpToMovementComponent

* Fixed: World origin rebasing now properly shifts hidden actors in the persistent level

#### Foliage

* New: Added a check that the hierarchical instanced mesh "unbuilt bounds list" is the correct size, and fixed a bug where on undo the bounds list would be one entry larger than expected.

    * There was a crash in 4.10 where the bounds list was unexpectedly empty, we haven't yet seen it in 4.11 but hopefully the check will catch it if it is still happening.

* Bugfix: Crash when alt-drag-duplicating a static mesh with attached foliage

* Bugfix: SpeedTree foliage was flickering and there were other rendering glitches especially when the same SpeedTree was used both with foliage or instancing, and with regular StaticMeshActors.

* Bugfix: Memory leak in instanced static mesh lightmap/shadowmap building

    * (Approx 200 MB leaked per 1 million instances every lighting build)

* Bugfix: a bug in Foliage Type loading code when converting 4.9 content's bEnableStaticLighting setting to a Mobility value.

    * If your Foliage content from 4.9 was opened in 4.10 and then resaved, it's possible foliage with bEnableStaticLighting=true would have incorrectly had its Mobility setting set to Movable.

    * Static lighting would no longer work on the foliage unless the Mobility setting was changed back to Static. Please check your Foliage Type assets and set their mobility to Static if needed.

#### Cooker

* New: Avoid cooker reloading ddc data at end of cook to generate asset registry. Reduces time to GenerateAssetRegistry.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Added support for diffing cooked packages against a previously cooked package to help track down deterministic cooking issues.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Added warning to resave material package when a dependent texture becomes out of date.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Added warning to resave the source package of a blueprint when a child blueprint function / dependency is out of date.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Changed libraryCategoriesText to EDITORONLY_DATA as it's not needed in cooked builds and was causing deterministic cooking issues with UMaterialFunctions.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Fixed issue with distribution not having PostLoad called before initializing RawDistribution.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Stopped kismet enums from re-initializing FText from strings.

* New: Moved ogg size tag from the asset registry as it causes bulk data to be loaded unnecessarily.

* New: Precache shaders for platform in editor has max inflight jobs, to keep editor responsive while cooking

    * Added commandline options to cook a single package from the editor / commandlet for debugging purposes

* New: Reduced peak memory when cooking by clearing out already processed textures / audio data.

* New: Stopped default materials from being included in cooked content when they are not required.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Distribution float was missing it's postload call before initializing Raw distribution, causing errors in min / max also causing deterministic cooking issues.

* New: Deterministic cooking: Removed AssetImportData from the cooked builds.

* New: Deterministic cooking: stopped kismet enums from reinitializing FText from strings.

* New: Deterministic issue: Moved LibraryCategoriesText into editor only data as it's not needed in cooked builds.

* Bugfix: File->Cook option in the editor now receives all options specified in project settings.

* Bugfix: Iterative cooking was not working if the Uproject name was different to the project name.

* Bugfix: "AllMaps" was being included for cook when providing a map on the command-line.

* Bugfix: There was a hang when building audio if audio was not in DDC.

* Bugfix: Multiprocess cooking was resaving asset registry multiple times.

* Bugfix: Various issues that were only showing up during the process of packaging a project from the editor are now resolved.

* Bugfix: Stopped packages which failed to cook from being saved in the asset regsitry.

### Gameplay Framework

* New: Added some extra keywords to Delay and RetriggerableDelay in KismetSystemLibrary.

* New: It is not possible to resize game windows in non fullscreen mode for Windows.

* New: Added support for replicated generic events to deliver a vector payload.

* New: There is now a "ListTimers" console command, which lists all currently active Timers to the log output.

* New: Added "bTickBeforeOwner" to MovementComponent to control whether a tick prereq is set for the owner.

    * Default is true since, in most cases, a ticking Pawn would need the latest location from the component update. Disabling this can get back some performance when the order doesn't matter.

* New: Added "set controller" keywords to Possess and UnPossess in Controller classes.

* New: Added GetSquaredDistanceTo method to AActor to get the squared distance between two actors.

* New: Added an OnLanded function delegate to the Character class for triggering logic based on CharacterMovementComponent landing.

* New: Added DrawTriangleUsingVertexColor function in FTriangleRenderer which takes the color from the vertices for the draw color.

    * Canvas Triangle items will now use the vertex color by default (since there was previously no other way of passing the color to them).

* New: Added extra methods to Spline Component for finding the closest point on the spline to a given world location.

* New: Added improved title text to UAbilitySystemComponent debug display - contains category of debug information along with avatar and owner info and their respective roles.

* New: Added KeyState accessor function to UPlayerInput.

* New: Added new p.VisualizeMovement cvar for showing in-world debug drawing of CharacterMovementComponent state (velocity and acceleration text and arrows show up over character heads when enabled).

* New: Added UGameplayCueManager::ShouldAsyncLoadObjectLibrariesAtStart which can be overridden in game-specific derived classes to determine if async object library loads should be triggered on creation.

* New: Changed SplineMeshActor so that its SplineMeshComponent defaults to allowing editing per-instance.

* New: Eliminated overhead of the HUD HitBox system when not being used.

* New: FPS Chart goes to 120 FPS now

* New: GameplayEffect GrantedAbilities respect Effect inhibition (ongoing tag requirements) - abilities are applied/removed/cancelled based on whether the ongoing tags are met or not

    * Previously, if application tags passed, target would have the granted ability for full duration of effect application, even if the ongoing tags weren't met

* New: Implementation of Anim Notifies for Play Sound and Spawn Particle Effect moved from blueprint to native.

* New: Optimized Matinee Actors no longer tick unless playing

* New: Optimized component transform updates by adding bWantsOnUpdateTransform, which controls calling OnUpdateTransform virtual

* New: Particles: added "bAutoManageAttachment" option to ParticleSystemComponent such that it can automatically attach to a component when activated and detach when deactivated.

    * During registration this will also detach the component from any AttachParent previously assigned.

    * bAutoManageAttachment avoids initial attachment unless the system is set to auto activate.

* New: Reduced overhead related to determining which streaming levels should be loaded and visible.

* New: Some extra functions to InterpToMovementComponent

    * Added function to reset the component after its been stopped and allow it to restart.

    * Added function to initialize the control points array after points have been added (This allows points to be added after BeginPlay has been called)

* New: SplineComponent: Added RemoveSplinePoint() and AddSplinePointAtIndex() functions that can also be called from a Blueprint.

* New: The controller light color can now be set from blueprints.

* New: Touch inputs can now be bound used with functions such as GetInputKeyTimeDown, IsKeyDown, etc. from blueprints.

* New: UTextRenderComponent and UFont will now not be loaded on dedicated servers - watch out for NULL references!

* New: You can now bind the Any key. This will respond to any key press/release event and follows the same rules for consumption that other keys follow.

* New: You can now bind the Any key. This will respond to any key press/release event and follows the same rules for consumption that other keys follow.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to PlayerCameraManager crashing on empty entries in DefaultModifiers array.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when player stands in a PhysicsVolume that streams out. PrimitiveComponents with bShouldUpdatePhysicsVolume are prevented from continuing to reference PhysicsVolumes in a level that is streamed out.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to changing the mobility of a component.

* Bugfix: Crash fix when using open console command in PIE to travel to level, or a level that has a sub-level, that is also a sub-level of the open editor world.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to CheckStillInWorld() after Actor has been destroyed or is not in the world.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to PainCausingVolume when streamed out while objects are still overlapping.

* Bugfix: Crash fix in projects where the project-specified game instance class does not exist. Instead, an error will be logged and the game will fall back to the default game instance class.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to GameSession in the case that PlayerStateClass is null.

* Bugfix: CameraShakes with OscillationDuration of -1 will now shake indefinitely, as intended.

* Bugfix: Icons in Windows task bar are set correctly for blueprint Windows games.

* Bugfix: Duplicate overlap events no longer run when moving a component during an overlap event that involves that component.

* Bugfix: Actors and Components with Primary Tick Functions that do not start with tick enabled will no longer fail to start ticking when instructed to do so.

* Bugfix: Removed multiple bugs related to creating more than one UWorld within one game engine instance.

    * Using multiple UWorlds with UGameEngine is still very experimental, and your mileage may vary.

* Bugfix: Fixed issues playing CameraAnims that don't have a movement track.

* Bugfix: Visualization sub-components for camera component could end up duplicated and one version would be in the incorrect location.

* Spectator pawn movement now accounts for per-actor time dilation.

* Bugfix: Fixed USplineComponent::GetInputKeyAtDistanceAlongSpline for closed loops so that the correct value is returned when the input key lies on the closing segment of the loop.

* Bugfix: Level streaming will now correctly handle "package async load failed" event

* Bugfix: GameInstance objects will no longer be leaked when exiting Play In Editor due to referenced objects preventing garbage collection.

    * When PIE ends all Objects outered to the GameInstance are now marked pending kill in the same way that Objects outered to the World are.

* Bugfix: GetInputKeyTimeDown now returns correct value for Touch inputs.

* Bugfix: Changing the values of the Main and Alt Input Keys for a Touch Interface now works correctly.

* Bugfix: Actor destruction will no longer output warnings about moving a component with a non-movable mobility.

* Bugfix: Actors being spawned during another Actors' BeginPlay during map load will no longer cause ensure() to be called.

* Bugfix: Component overlaps now always end when a component is destroyed.

* Bugfix: High res screenshot will not break focus in full screen games.

* Bugfix: Incorrect Begin/End overlap events are no longer run when BeginOverlap is used to disable collision or overlap events on the other object.

* Bugfix: Actors/Components will no longer tick until BeginPlay() has been called when in a game world. This was an issue in some situations in network games.

    * Actors may opt out of this by setting bAllowTickBeforeBeginPlay to true. APlayerController, AInfo and derived classes (AGameMode, AWorldSettings, etc) enable this by default because they typically have match start up logic.

    * Components with no Actor owner will start ticking immediately before the world begins play. This should be rare however.

    * Editor worlds don't "begin play", so ticking begins immediately in those.

* Bugfix: GameplayCues will no longer be invoked from ActiveGameplayEffectsContainer::NetDeltaSerialize when there are unmapped objects. This was causing GameplayCues to be invoked with incomplete information in their EffectContext.	

* Bugfix: Timers that are set and paused in the same frame now keep track of their remaining time correctly.

* Null pointer checks on LocalPlayer->ViewportClient have been added to PlayerController.cpp.

* bShowDebugForReticleTarget in the HUD is no longer static.

* AInfo's root component in editor builds is now set to the sprite component. This avoids AInfo subclasses generating warnings when going into PIE.

* ChildActors now inherit their visibility from the owning component and actor visibility.

* Keys bound via key or action events will now count as having consumed the event even if there wasn't a pressed or released event this frame. This prevents axes from using the key in lower priority input components in future frames.

* Lighting and vertex coloring now persists correctly for Child Actor Components.

* Memory corruption no longer occurs due to improper clean up of GameplayDebuggingReplicator

* Network clients now sync physics simulation state (on/off) from the server if bReplicateMovement is true.

* OnComponentDestroyed now ensures and logs an error about the inconsistency instead of crashing in the case a component is in the AttachChildren array, but has no AttachParent.

* Optimized FURL construction when passed a short map name by trying the asset registry before resorting to a disc search. This can save 10-20 seconds when issuing an "open mapname" console command on some platforms.

* OnComponentBeginOverlap has been prevented from triggering more than once in some cases, usually when the event tries to disable collision or overlaps.

* DestroyActor calls will no longer recurse.

* Removed allocations in player input system.

* In USceneComponent, AttachTo() now returns a bool indicating if attachment is successful (or if already attached). OnRegister() now clears AttachParent and AttachSocketName if the AttachTo() call fails.

    * Fixes AttachParent still being set when initialized in a constructor but when the attachment is invalid.

* When destroying a component, attached children will now remain correctly at the same world position.

* Whether or not to draw subtitles will now take immediate effect rather than waiting for the next sound to play.

* Improved error message when SpawnActor fails due to the spawned actor being marked pending kill.

### Learning Resources

* New: Clarified some comparison functions (IsZero, IsNearlyZero, Equals) in FRotator to explain that they compare as orientations, not other interpretations such as rotational speed, winding, etc.

#### Sample Content

* Bugfix: Old file was checked out. Had to revert.

### Localization

* New: Added ability to opt out of adding reference comments as extracted comments when exporting localization to PO files.

* New: Added new setting for localization import/export in order to persist comments in PO files that aren't generated from manifest/archive.

* New: Culture names now consistently use hyphens rather than underscores. Culture names with underscores are still accepted.

* New: First pass of the OneSky plugin: Extend Localization Dashboard toolbar with OneSky buttons for "Import all cultures/targets from OneSky" and "Export all cultures/targets to OneSky"

* New: Improved the text gather from assets

    * We now gather the texts from Blueprints using their generated class and script bytecode. This avoids polluting a game gather with all of the editor-only texts that come from the K2 nodes in the blueprint asset.

    * The objects within a package are now gathered recursively, as this correctly honors the editor-only flags used by the containing object (this both recurses by walking properties - to detect editor-only properties - but also by gathering all of the inner objects at each level).

    * We now recurse through and gather from map properties.

    * Fixed texts of differing case being combined when gathering from assets.

    * Editor tutorial BPs are now gathered as as editor-only.

* New: Overall improved Editor Region & Language settings page.

* New: Blueprint text pins now generate a new key each time they are set, rather than use a deterministic key

    * This matches what text properties do, and removes the possibility of having a duplicate key (eg, if you serialized some data from a BP pin, changed the BP pin text, and then reloaded the data).

* Bugfix: FTextLocalizationManager::UpdateFromLocalizationResource was discarding the data it had loaded

* Bugfix: Crash on the Chinese version of Windows version when changing the editor language

* Bugfix: Some FText instances were not rebuilding correctly when the culture is changed

* Bugfix: The culture display name was not updating when the culture was changed

* Bugfix: The Category Names of Components in blueprints are no longer gathered for localization when the "ShouldGatherEditorOnlyData" setting is false.

* Bugfix: The editor now loads all available cultures

    * It only used to load EFIGSCJK culture data, which prevented you being able to localize for other cultures.

* Bugfix: The spoken text of dialogue wave assets are now gathered for localization under the root localization namespace, rather than a "Dialogue" namespace.

* Bugfix: The translation editor now properly supports viewing and editing the individual translations for different contexts of a dialogue wave's spoken text.

* Updated PO export/import logic to use generate msgctxt based on namespace and, conditionally, key (only if key metadata is present) and added info metadata as extracted comments.

### Networking

* New: Added ability to force various replay failure conditions. Use demo.ForceFailure to enable. 1 Will force failure during initial call to start streaming. 2 will simulate load map failure.

* New: Added an initial implementation of an InMemoryNetworkReplayStreaming module.

    * Unlike NullNetworkReplayStreaming and HttpNetworkReplayStreaming, this implementation doesn't rely on the disk or network, and as a result is generally much faster.

    * It is intended to be used for specific cases where a local, transient replay would be useful.

* New: Added initial support for game clients to record replays. Previously replay recording was only supported on servers.

    * A client replay will only record the client's view of the world, so actors that are not considered network relevant to the client will not be present in the replay.

    * Note that RPCs are not currently supported in client replays.

* New: Added new Lobby module for a server to host a lobby via beacons before actually connecting to the server itself. Actor replication and classes similar to AGameMode (ALobbyBeaconHost), AGameState (ALobbyBeaconState), APlayerController (ALobbyBeaconClient), and APlayerState(ALobbyBeaconPlayerState) added.

* New: Added -REPLAY= cmdline option, which allows you to play a replay from the cmdline

* New: Added server network stats that measure in/out bandwidth per client connection (min among clients, max among clients, average among clients).

* New: Added task system to replay systems internals for more code maintainability, and stability.

* New: Allow ping to subtract server and client frame time from ping to try and predict what true cloud ping is

    * Set net.PingExcludeFrameTime to 1 to test this out

* New: Better networking logging format. Example: [2015.08.03-21.06.12:006][285]LogNet: UChannel::CleanUp: ChIndex == 0. Closing connection. [UChannel] ChIndex: 0, Closing: 0 [UNetConnection] RemoteAddr: x.x.x.x:xxxx, Name: IpConnection_1, Driver: IpNetDriver_3 IpNetDriver_3, Server: YES, PC: NULL, Owner: BeaconClient_0

* New: Changed the stats port format to be "HTTP-like" (just enough to be compatible with curl/wget/etc)

    * stubbed out a super basic framework for being able to issue exec commands via this port (not open by default and binds only to loopback)

* New: Custom events are now supported in demo replays. An event has custom metadata and data and is tied to a timestamp in the replay.

* New: Allow for servers to create multiple voice data channels.

* New: Initial Oodle support as a plug-in added. This is work in progress, and will improve over time.

* New: Lots of networking profiler improvements:

    * Restore chart position when loading new charts after applying filters

    * Draw last selected range as a transparent red overlay to remind you where selection is after zooming out/scrolling

    * Re-calculate selected range when filters are applied

    * Fixed more anchoring issues when maximizing window

    * Removed default chart series from designer since we add these programmatically now

    * Added context menu strip for future right click capabilities to be added

    * Differentiating replicated actor count from total actor count to give a sense of waste

    * Added "hz" to end of count/s items in summary * Added "Bytes/s" when representing bytes per second in summary

    * Added tabs for summary, actor perf, and details

    * Actor perf view how uses a list view, with actual columns you can sort by

    * Added combo box for search filters that fill in automatically fill in with searchable data, and supports auto-complete

    * Added "Waste" columns to actor perf view, which shows how much an actor updates vs actually replicates something

    * Add KB/s in actor details view + more anchoring fixes

    * Allow loading partial networking profiles (so you no longer have to force a level change to save the profile)

* New: Messaging: Implemented interceptor tracing

* New: Minor improvement to the setup/tick logic of the perf counter module query port implementation. Should prevent "connection not ready" timeout issues that occur sporadically.

* New: Optimized networking CPU time somewhat by not ticking network channels that don't need to be ticked.

* New: The NullNetworkReplayStreaming implementation can now play back live games. This is useful for testing with multiple instances of the game running on the same machine.

* New: The replay streamer implementation module to use can now be overridden at runtime.

    * You can pass the name of the module to use into FNetworkReplayStreaming::GetFactory, or you can use the "ReplayStreamerOverride=" URL option. The URL option is useful when combined with the "DemoRec" URL option.

    * If neither of these overrides is provided, the implementation will fall back to the one defined by the "DefaultFactoryName" in the Engine configuration file, as before.

* New: The replay streaming system can now scrub to a new time while playback is paused. Try it out in ShooterGame!

* New: UdpMessaging: Added console commands for basic diagnostics

* New: UdpMessaging: Added tunnel connection stats to diagnostics command

* New: Allow replay chunks to request downloads even if something else is in-flight or pending

* Bugfix: Added missing socket error type ENODEV

* Bugfix: Removed bug in FNetViewer::FNetViewer that could cause the view location to be at (0,0,0) when nothing was hit which would then cause the net relevancy distance check to fail.

* Bugfix: Character movement component now has better smoothing when going up/down terrain in replays

* Bugfix: Disconnect instead of assert when channels receive reliable packets before fully opening (this can happen from malicious clients)

* Bugfix: A fatal error if a replication notify function couldn't be found at runtime. Now a warning will be logged and the notify function will simply be skipped.

* Bugfix: Replays were not recording at intended framerate

* Bugfix: RPC's weren't being sent to connections + fixes warning spam where rpc's were getting rejected

* Bugfix: Issues when replay scrubbing was aborted mid scrub

* Bugfix Crash that happens when server stops recording replays

* Bugfix: Crashwhen loading older replays

* Bugfix: Bug prevented HTTP retries from working. TimeSinceLastResponse was not getting reset with ElapsedTime so once a request timed out it would always time out N more times until the retry sys gives up

* Bugfix: Bug caused the incorrect IRepChangedPropertyTracker to be passed to the UActorComponent::PreReplication function during replay recording. The tracker is now correctly looked up in the demo net driver instead of the game net driver.

* Bugfix: Crash  occured when many static meshes set to replicate movement were placed in a level.

* Bugfix: Crashed when the server stops recording a replay.

* Bugfix: Fixed a race condition in UdpMessaging

* Bugfix: Replay recording could cause large portions of "dead air" to be saved into the replay if there were slow frames during recording.

* Bugfix: An issue caused the output log to spam "no owning connection" warnings when a client used the "ToggleDebugCamera" console command.

* Bugfix: An issue occurred while connecting a client to a server while in Play In Editor (PIE) mode during runtime might fail and instead load the default map. The travel to the server's world should now succeed.

* Bugfix: FNetViewer::FNetViewer could cause the view location to be at (0,0,0) when nothing was hit which would then cause the net relevancy distance check to fail.

* Bugfix: Incorrect receive buffer size in UdpSocketReceiver

* Bugfix: If the server detected a malicious packet, the connection would then remain open until session manually stopped

* Bugfix: Fixed typo in property tooltip and comments

* Bugfix: Lots of cleanup and improvements to how we smooth out character movement in replay playback.

* Bugfix: Lowered the verbosity of networking logs involving doubly acked packets, and out of sequence packets (this is completely normal when there is packet loss)

* Bugfix: Messaging: Fixed message bridge not unregistering remote endpoints on shutdown

* Bugfix: Networking: Processing UDP receive buffer only if bytes received.

* Bugfix: Ping calculation fixes:

    * Fix bug where extra acks were contributing to ping.

    * Call FlushNet on frames where SendAck was called.

### Other

* **New: ****Stat Budget View

    * A new budget view allows you to configure which stats you want to see (across different stat groups if needed) and gives you a running total that is broken down by threads. This view is useful for prioritizing CPU performance for different features of characters and gameplay objects. You can assign a total budget per thread.

![image alt text](image_57.png)

A view is specified in your DefaultEngine.ini by creating a new section and use that section name as the budget name.

[MainPlayerHero]

+Stats=STAT_AnimGameThreadTime

+Stats=-STAT_BlueprintUpdateAnimation

+Stats=-STAT_Montage_Advance

+Stats=STAT_PerformAnimEvaluation_WorkerThread

+Stats=STAT_ClothTotalTime

+Stats=FPhysXClothTask

GameThread=0.25

MergedTaskGraphThreads=1.0

A "-" in front of the stat indicates that this stat should not be counted for the running total since a parent stat is already accounting for the time.

To bring up this view simply use budget <section name>

You can also filter stat and budget groups by root strings. For example, "stat anim -root=MainPlayerHero" will show the stats that you'd expect from "stat anim" but will filter by UObjects that have "MainPlayerHero" as a substring of their name. This is not limited to UObjects as it's simply looking at parent stats with that substring in their name.

Stats are automatically broken into the threads they execute on and can appear in multiple threads if that is the case.

* New: Enabled subsurface scattering on OpenGL.

* New: Extended the ShaderCache to perform batched shader precompilation which can be made more aggressive behind loading screens to reduce the time to load while still minimising in-game hitching.

    * With "r.UseAsyncShaderPrecompilation" enabled shader precompilation is now executed on the render thread alongside the predraw, not as a single operation on loading the binary cache.

    * The setting "r.TargetPrecompileFrameTime" controls what the target frame rate should be when performing async. precompile and the shader cache will try and adjust how many shaders to precompile to stay within this limit, with a minimum of 1 shader per frame.

    * The shader cache is now updated during initial loading to take advantage of the time spent loading essential data to do as much of the precompile as possible.

    * It is possible to accelerate the shader cache's precompilation by specifying 'r.AccelPredrawBatchTime' and "r.AccelTargetPrecompileFrameTime" to larger values, then calling FShaderCache::BeginAcceleratedBatching() to start using the more aggressive values and FShaderCache::EndAcceleratedBatching() to go back to the normal values.

* Improved in-game zoom in/out using scroll gesture for users of Magic Mouse and trackpads

* Increased the size of stack for the game thread on Mac again to work around some more problems with running out of stack memory. Also, we now use a different stack size for debug builds.

* Bugfix: Stopped Mac OS X compiler stripping necessary allocator overrides and causing memory errors.

* Bugfix: Stopped windows being resized to fit on a single display when running under Mac OS X.

    * Windows will still be repositioned to prevent them creeping under the menu bar and fullscreen game windows are still resized to fit a single display.

    * This makes it possible to capture screenshots of windows that are larger than the current display.

* Bugfix: When locking an OpenGL buffer for writing then discard the backing store by setting the size to 0 rather than redundantly reallocating the buffer to its existing size which will be done again on unlock.

* Bugfix: Settings used to generate application manifests are now explicitly loaded for that build step.

* Bugfix: Texture cooking is now dependent on the XDK used to do the cook, which prevents corruption caused by differing tiling modes in different XDKs (for example).

#### FX

* New: Cascade: Added a viewport overlay display of 'Completed' when a self-terminating system has finished playing (controlled in the View..View Overlays menu)

* New: Added a number of useful particle system properties as asset registry searchable data

    * FixedBoundsSize (maximum component of the fixed bounds or None if it does not not use fixed bounds)

    * NumEmitters (number of emitter modules)

    * NumLODs (number of levels of detail)

    * LODMethod (method of computing which LOD to use)

    * LODDistanceCheckTime (interval of LOD checking when LOD mode is automatic)

    * Looping (True if the emitter will keep playing forever without external intervention)

    * These will show up in the content browser as tooltips or in the columns view, but unloaded particle systems will not have values for these columns until they are resaved!

* New: Added flag Auto Deactivate for particle systems. This will automatically deactivate particle systems that have completed and won't spawn again, even if the emitter duration hasn't expired yet. This can help performance by essentially auto-trimming the duration, especially useful for non-looping burst-only systems that don't continuously spawn particles.

* New: GPU particles are now simulated using fixed timestep, allowing different frame times and gameplay time scales to generate consistent results.

    * The fixed timestep is configurable through the ini variable "r.GPUParticle.FixDeltaSeconds".

    * A tolerance is configurable through "r.GPUParticle.FixTolerance" to prevent small variation of frame time to affect the number of iterations required.

    * The maximum number of iterations is limited by configuring "r.GPUParticle.MaxNumIterations". This prevents long frame from having costly simulations.

* New: It is now possible for deferred decals to access the underlying scene normals if they are not also updating it.

* New: Particle Effect lights can now be made 'high quality'. In those mode they go through the normal deferred lighting path. High Quality FX lights can also now become shadow casters. Content creators should use these sparingly as the performance impact can become very high, very quickly.

* New: Added a 'auto deactivate' flag for particle systems, that will automatically deactivate them if they can never again spawn particles. Useful for burst-only emitters, to not need to hand-trim emitter lifetime precisely.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that would cause the editor to hang after being minimized or losing focus and coming back to it, if GPU particles are visible.

* Bugfix: Fixed a case where fog used incorrect data.

* Bugfix: Fixed animated particle emitter attributes not being animated when time exceeded 1 second.

#### Lighting

* New: Added new PrimitiveComponent setting bSingleSampleShadowFromStationaryLights

    * When enabled, shadowing of a movable component from a stationary directional light will come from the Volume Lighting Samples precomputed by Lightmass

    * This provides essentially free on/off shadow receiving on dynamic objects, with a fade over time between states

    * Lighting has to be rebuilt once for this to work

* New: Added SourceCubemapAngle to sky lights, so the incoming lighting can be rotated

* New: Lightmap streaming fixes - Changed the default MaxLightmapRadius from 2k to 10k, as the previous default made thousands of tiny textures.

* New: Lightmass triangle normal is now averaged over the lightmap texel, improves cases where a small ledge near the texel center causes the final gather to be self-occluded.

    * The lighting position is no longer offset when detecting intersecting surface frontfaces within a texel. This was causing fully shadowed artifacts in cracks, as one side of the crack would move the shading position into the other.

* Bugfix: Fix for objects being culled by the near plane of the shadow frustum with RTDF shadows (shadow casters behind the camera pop out)

* Bugfix: Fixed a case where self-shadowing would break when selecting an object.

* Bugfix: Fixed a minor self-shadowing artifact.

* Bugfix: Fixed a rare case where Lightmass would hang on the final stage.

* Bugfix: Fixed line light source shadows in lightmass

* Bugfix: Fixed several incorrect interactions between HLODs and Lightmass.

* Bugfix: Fixed skylight occlusion maps being generated from Lightmass for static skylights. Reduces lightmap encoding time, disk space and memory when only a static skylight is present.

* Bugfix: Fixed skylights on translucency in projects with static lighting disabled

* Bugfix: Fixed spot lights not generating cast shadows

* Bugfix: Fixed translucent self-shadowing on static meshes using the static draw path

* Bugfix: Fixes for building lighting in a commandlet

* Bugfix: More graceful handling of overflowing object count for distance field shadowing and DFAO

* Bugfix: Objects with 0 scale are excluded from the distance field scene, fixes bugs with several lighting methods with 0 scale objects

* Bugfix: Removed shading terminator bias meant for shadow map acne but it made character faces look worse.

* Bugfix: The static shadow depth map used to shadow translucency from Stationary lights is now saved properly during a blueprint construction script

#### Materials

* New: Added Dithered Opacity Mask option for materials.

* New: Derive Tangent Basis: New material function can derive a tangent basis from a specified UV channel in order to use normal maps from UV channels other than 0. Can also output a world normal transformed into the derived basis.

* New: Give access to SceneDepth in WorldPositionOffset

* New: Parallax Occlusion Mapping: added checkbox to use worldcoordinates which skips tangent space transform. For xy world coordinate materials.

* New: Parallax Occlusion Mapping: fixed compile error on macs caused by uninitialized variable.

* New: TextureCoordiate ID now shown in the caption in a materialexpression.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash which occurred when overriding the blend mode of a distortion material to opaque in a material instance.

* Bugfix: Fixed DepthFade material node

* Bugfix: Fixed issue with distortion not rendering on opaque materials that have been overridden to be translucent in an instance.

* Bugfix: Fixed issues with volumetric deferred decals (quality, baked shadows, depth out) partly from Inigo Quilez

* Bugfix: Fixed UI materials not working with separate translucency

* Bugfix: Materials using separate translucency should now work in stereo mode or other multiple-view scenarios.

* Bugfix: Shader compiler emits a warning when instanced stereo is enabled but not supported for the target RHI

#### Postprocessing

* **New: ****Updated Camera Lens Effects

    * The camera lens effect system has been heavily updated.  We've streamlined the process of adding particle effects such as water droplets or dirt to the game camera "lens" and it now follows camera motion properly.  These features can be used in both C++ code and Blueprints.

    * To use this feature, create a subclass or Blueprint of AEmitterCameraLensEffectBase and configure it as desired. These effects can then be triggered via the PlayerController or PlayerCameraManager, using functions such as APlayerCameraManager::AddCameraLensEffect() or APlayerController::ClientSpawnCameraLensEffect().

* Bugfix: Fixed multiple ScreenSpaceSubusrfaceScattering artifacts

* Bugfix: Fixed a performance regression in the Screen Space Ambient Occlusion

* Bugfix: Fixed blacks of old tonemapper not being black with log space LUT.

* Bugfix: Fixed broken material post process blendable references

    * This is can be enabled/disabled per static mesh in the static mesh editor under "Build Reversed Index Buffer" in the "Build Settings" section.

* New: Improved the texture streaming logic when hierarchical LODs are used.

    * Hierarchical LOD textures are not streamed anymore unless they are visible.

    * Static meshes having hierarchical LODs are not considered by the texture streaming logic when their hierarchical LODs are visible.

    * A transition prefetch distance is configured by the "RangePrefetchDistance" value in the [TextureStreaming] ini section.

* New: LOD dithering now applies a stencil optimization when using a full z-prepass.

* New: Material nodes hooked to multiple inputs (emissive, normal, etc) will now share generated code resulting in less shader instructions

* New: Optimized particle system initialization by caching more information in advance.

* New: 'ShowMaterialDrawEvents' now reports triangle counts properly

* New: When using separate translucency, setting r.SeparateTranslucencyScreenPercentage [0;100] can be used to change the resolution of translucency rendering as a percentage of the current rendering resolution. This can be useful to reduce fillrate and bandwidth demand especially for effects heavy situations.

* New: Adding instanced stereo support for the following factory types: terrain, foliage, beams, particle trails and GPU particle sprites.

* New: Adding instanced stereo tessellation support

* Bugfix: Disable instanced stereo rendering when not using a compatible RHI.

#### Mobile Rendering

* New: Devices that do support hardware instancing will always use it (most Android devices, all iOS devices)

* New: HQ ES2 Reflections

    * Added mobile material flag to enable high quality reflections. (parallax correction).

    * It selects the nearest 3 reflection captures to the primitive and reflects based on the capture size and type.

* New: 'Receive Decals' flag supported on all meshes (previously only for skeletal meshes)

* New: There is now a Project Setting checkbox "Game Discards Unused Material Quality Levels".

    * This allows a Device Profile to select shaders from a particular Quality Level at startup and then free up the memory occupied by shaders for the other quality levels.

    * If the checkbox is not checked, the shader quality level could be changed at runtime by game code, for example by a Settings user interface screen.

* New: Update reflection captures button now works when using the editor in mobile preview mode.

* New: Adreno 420 based devices will use [Android_High] profile

* Bugfix: Fix lighting error in mobile / mobile preview where an object that is fully shadowed from the directional light instead renders as fully lit

    * This only happened if there was _another_ (e.g. point) light causing the object to have a shadowmap

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug in mobile preview mode in which a material texture's alpha channel would be erroneously gamma corrected before use.

* Bugfix: Cases where UMG material was not rendering correctly on mobile devices

* Bugfix:  HUD::DrawMaterialSimple does not look correct on Android device when MobileHDR is disabled

* Bugfix:  Materials not showing up in HUD on mobile

* Bugfix: Refraction should not cause rendering artifacts on devices that do not support refraction

* Bugfix: Rendering artifacts specific to Nexus 6 devices

* Bugfix: Static shadows rendering artifacts on Galaxy S6 Android 6.0.1

* Bugfix: Translucent objects disappear if scene has decals or mod shadows enabled

* Bugfix: Uniform binding logic for OpenGL, now it correctly handles situations when uniform array was optimized away in a linked program. This was causing various rendering issues on Android 6.x devices.

* Bugfix: Widget 3D Component is not rendering on specific Android devices

* Bugfix: When updating reflection captures, the editor now waits for any outstanding shader compilation to complete. This issue was causing black reflection captures on mobile in some circumstances.

### UI

* New: Added visual editing of analytics provider settings inside the project settings

* New: Converted the Slate text layout to use shaped text

    * The Slate text layout is now aware of bi-directional text. Each hard-line (paragraph) within a document will calculate its base flow direction, and then each run within that line will be broken at flow direction boundaries before being converted into blocks for the text layout to shape and draw.

    * The base flow direction is used to adjust the logical justification of the text, so that when dealing with right-to-left text, a "left" justification will be transformed into a "right" justification and vice versa. The base flow direction is also used when splitting the text for a line into its directional blocks, as it may affect where some characters are placed, such as brackets and quotes.

    * The default text shaping method (see ETextShapingMethod) is Auto, as this will always produce the correct result regardless of the text being shaped. You can override this default using the "Slate.DefaultTextShapingMethod" CVar, and you can also override the shaping method per-widget (for example, if you had widget that you knew would only contain numbers, you could set the shaping method to KerningOnly to avoid any bi-directional detection over

    * The default flow detection method (see ETextFlowDirection) is Auto, as this will always produce the natural result for the text in question. You can override this default using the "Slate.DefaultTextFlowDirection" CVar, and you can also override the flow detection method per-widget.

* Bugfix: After closing the console, keyboard focus will now be restored automatically to the widget that had focus when the console was opened.

* Bugfix: Changed the font used when a font is missing or invalid to be the last resort font, rather than the localized fallback font

    * The localized fallback font could cause different results based on your culture, and the last resort font makes it clearer that something is set-up incorrectly as it just draws invalid glyph markers for all of the text.

* Bugfix: Creating a menu anchor with a MenuLeft placement now works properly, in both UMG and native Slate

* Bugfix: Fix a crash in widget blueprint animation which would occur when starting a new animation in response to another animation ending.

* Bugfix: Fix placement of widgets spawned from a MenuLeft Menu Anchor

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when deleting a font in the font editor

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash while editing a font in the editor with no TTF/OTF file set

* Bugfix: Fixed a font cache crash when using a 3D widget

* Bugfix: Fixed an infinite loop when using Ctrl+Up/Down in a multi-line editable text

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where floating windows were having their border size added again and again, causing them to grow in size with each subsequent editor launch.

    * Allowed PIE windows to not respect work area bounds if they are created centered, so that they can overlap off the edge of the screen (to give the impression of a fullscreen window).

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in UObject::SetLinker after loading some circularly dependent UMG assets

* Bugfix: Fixed some kerning issues when scaling text

    * We now handle scaling the kerning ourself, as FreeType scaling didn't work correctly for all fonts

* Bugfix: Loading movies can now be skipped via gamepad button press.

* Bugfix: Fixed STextBlock not passing through the reply of the double-click handler

* Bugfix: When SWindows are constructed with an auto center rule in place, their size will now be automatically clamped to not be bigger than the preferred work area. This prevents partially offscreen windows from being created.

#### Slate

* New: Added custom UV support to Slate vertex shaders

* New: Added different scroll descendant behavior for scrolling into view, or to the top of the scrollable area

* New: SListView objects now handles gamepad directional up/down and left analog up/down for scrolling.

* New: Table Row expander arrow brush is now customizable

* New: Updates to the PS4 virtual cursor

    * Cannot leave the bounds of the screen

    * No longer spams MouseDown events while a face button is pressed on a controller. On press = one mouse down (just like a mouse!)

    * In "Game and UI" input mode with cursor hiding during capture enabled, the cursor does not move during capture. This prevents an issue where the hidden cursor was still bound to the edges of the screen and restricted the possible movement during capture.

* Bugfix: Substantial progress has been made in hardening Slate.  Lots of problems related to memory lifetime/strange crashes have been fixed.  This was especially problematic on platforms using a separate RHI Thread.

* Bugfix: Fixing a long standing issue with the 3D Slate Renderer. It was conditionally flushing the font cache which in the case that it needed updating was causing it to corrupt the frame that was actively being rendered and needed the cache to still be alive. The primary renderer is now the only one who should be conditionally flushing the cache. This crash normally reproduced by crashing inside of ​FSlateRHIRenderingPolicy::DrawElements(), trying to access the memory of a now bogus shader resource that was previously the shader resource of the font cache.

* Bugfix: Double-click when the mouse captor has capture is now treated as a normal mouse button down event (prevents the double click event falling through to other widgets)

* Bugfix: Ensured that Engine/Runtime modules don't depend on SlateReflector in a shipping build

* Bugfix: Fix for scrollbox not updating when jumping to a descendant widget

* Bugfix: SButton::SetButtonStyle now updates hovered and pressed sounds. These sounds can be dynamically changed from a Blueprint by simply switching the button's style.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash that could occur when flushing the font cache when drawing the main window element.

* Bugfix: Fixed a memory leak in shaped text

* Bugfix: Fixed bug where Slate Button didn't use it's disabled brush when disabled by hierarchy.

* Bugfix: Fixed memory leak in Slate Renderer that can occur when a batch contains no vertex or index data.

* Bugfix: Fixed problem with menus not closing when clicking in another window on Mac.

* Bugfix: Resetting a slate brush image size will now correctly reset to the image size and not to the default slate size (32x32).

* Bugfix: Fixing several issues involving multi-touch. Data stored involving widgets under cursor are now bucketed based on user and cursor index so that multiple pointer devices, as well as index can independently hold separate widget under cursor data.

* Bugfix: In an editable text box, the caret position is now updated in the next tick if the text was changed via virtual keyboard input.

* Bugfix: Mac OS X: Fixed a potential crash when closing windows

* Bugfix: Manually closing an SMenuAnchor will properly flag it as having been closed that frame

* Bugfix: SProgressBar marquee can now be tinted and accounts for widget color and opacity.

* Bugfix: Supersearch no longer displays the previous set of results if no results for the current search are found.

* Bugfix: The visibility of the SMenuContentWrapper that surrounds SMenuAnchor content is now set to match the visibility of the content

* Bugfix: Custom Draw elements no longer are attempted to be early clipped using the known scissor rect before going through the element batcher, since their clip rect info isn't valid we just ignore doing this step for those elements.

* Bugfix: Improving the way we track references to materials in slate to better keep things alive until they're no longer needed for rendering. Additionally, making it so the we use the material and texture free list when possible when cleaning up things as to not allocate new memory if not required. Coincidentally this can help with problems with corrupted memory on destruct as well, because it means the memory isn't really going to become garbage any more.

* Bugfix: Viewports can now use both pre-multiplied and non-pre-multiplied alpha blending

    * SViewport now has an PreMultipliedAlpha argument (default true), which can control whether to use pre-multiplied alpha when blending is enabled (blending is disabled by default).

    * Note: This is a change in behavior from 4.10, as non-pre-multiplied alpha blending used to be the default.

#### UMG

* New: Invalidation Box Widget - Allows child widgets to be cached and not be pre-passed, ticked or painted.

    * The Invalidation Box has been further enhanced from the one that went out in 4.10.  The newest version now caches the vertex and index buffers for the children widgets, so it can execute the draw calls directly instead of rebatching the element list every frame.

* New: Retainer Box Widget - Renders child widgets to an offscreen render target.

    * Some UI can be updated at a lower rate than the rest of the game.  You may for example, only want the HUD to redraw at 20Hz to increase performance.  The Retainer Box by rendering the widgets offscreen can present them every frame, but only update them at both a specific Frequency, and Phase.  To allow you to load balance when they redraw as well.

    * Bonus feature unrelated to performance is that because the children are rendered to an offscreen render target, you can use a material on the Retainer Box that can run shader code on the resulting retained buffer.  Which you could use to add some simple post process effects to the children.

* New: Added "Go to Variable" functionality for widgets in Widget Blueprint Editor.

    * When switching modes from Designer to Graph. The widget variable is automatically selected, if one exists.

* New: Added a function to convert slot to border slot.

* New: Added basic controller support for Checkbox, Slider, and ComboBox

    * Checkbox - Can now be toggled using the controller's bottom face button.

    * Slider - The controller's bottom face button must be pressed to begin manipulating the value. The value can be manipulated by using the controller's directional arrows ( This is relative to slider orientation ). Finally, press the face button to navigate away.

    * Combo box - The controller's bottom face button can be used to open the menu. Directional arrows can be used to navigate options before using the face button to accept the value.

* New: Added Blueprint callable functions for setting Slider handle and bar colors.

* New: Added individual start/finish delegates to widget animations. Note that stopping a playing animation will trigger OnFinished while pausing the animation will not.

* New: Added support for vertex shaders in UI materials.

* New: Adding a few extra scaling modes to the scale box, allowing it to Scale to Fit X, and Scale to Fix Y.

* New: Adding a new option to the "Replace With..." menu that offers up, replace with your child widget. So if you're a widget with a single child, you can delete yourself from the hierarchy and promote your children up.

* New: UserWidgets now have a Padding property for their content.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash that occurred when opening Widget Blueprint Editor if 'Animation' and 'Timeline' windows had been previously hidden.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash when dragging widgets out of Switchers in the UMG designer.

    * Fixed unsafe active widget index in SWidgetSwitcher that could act as out-of-bounds index into child array.

* Bugfix: Fixed drag-drop to and from named slots in the UMG widget hierarchy view.

* Fixed incorrect brightness for UMG Image widgets on mobile devices when the widget used both a texture and modified its color value.

* Bugfix: Fixed linker load warnings about WidgetTree outers in cooked builds (of the form Failed to load Outer for resource 'WidgetTree': WidgetBlueprint /Script/UMGEditor.Default__WidgetBlueprint)

* Bugfix: Fixed UMG compiler errors caused by changes to widget blueprints of nested child widgets.

* Bugfix: Fixed UMG editor allowing invalid object names when renaming widgets.

    * Having a period in the name of a widget would cause the editor to crash after copying and pasting.

* Bugfix: Slider value has been clamped to [0,1] to prevent the handle from sliding off the bar.

* Bugfix: UScrollBox's ScrollWidgetIntoView no longer crashes if you pass it a null widget.

* Bugfix: Renaming a widget in the designer is now reflected in the sequencer view.

* Bugfix: AddToPlayerScreen now properly respects any Aspect Ratio lock you currently have on the camera, so that it does not cover the black bars.

* Bugfix: When the Widget Component's Blend Mode is set to Masked, it now correctly makes itself relevant to the opaque pass so that it draws into the velocity buffer to prevent TxAA from blurring it.

* Bugfix: Fixed ScaleBox not reporting its relative layout scale correctly, and making it better at laying out text by doing another prepass after calculating the newest scale. Does add additional overhead for using the scalebox but ensures the proper result.

* Bugfix: We now properly synchronize the Layer property to the grid slot when it's changed.

* Bugfix: Attempting to parent multiple widgets (in Hierarchy tree) to a widget that can't have multiple children will notify the user and ignore the operation, rather than crashing.

* Bugfix: Now clearing the AllWidgets array on UWidgetTree after load. This should fix the issue with widgets removed at runtime not being garbage collected.

* Bugfix: Slate Brushes now properly pay attention to the Filter option on the UTexture you use.

* Bugfix: Fixing the Left menu anchor position to offset the correct amount.

* Bugfix: Slider Locked/HandleIndent properties are now respected.

* Bugfix: DrawTextFormatted is now correctly static.

* Bugfix: The WidgetComponent will now correctly hit test once again.

* Bugfix: Fixing placement of hint text in a TextBox when scaled, also multiply HintText's Color by the incoming widget tint, so that it's properly alpha blended if the parent's alpha is modified.

* Bugfix: Mostly fixing the notorious problem in UMG when modifying a dependent widget, and it causing cascading compile failures across all widgets that use it - forcing you to recompile them all manually. The new compiler code ensures we use the latest class before generating the variable list.

* Bugfix: Fixing the animation stopping code to permit a restart of the same animation on end. If it's played again, we don't add it to the stopped pool.

* Bugfix: The widget component now creates the correct collision volume and bounds for any pivot it is given, this fixes some of the strange hit testing issues. Fixing collision and bounds rendering in the editor to correctly render for multiple views and collision visualization now also renders, previously it never showed if you enabled the flag in the editor.

* Bugfix: Making it more obvious what keys do special stuff with anchors in UMG. Fixing the way snapping to anchors works with Control, it now only zeros out the side you're dragging instead of the entire widget, which was silly. Enhancing the designer message system to no longer be based on an enum and instead let arbitrary systems push and pop FText messages. Fixing animations in the anchor drop down to properly animate, broke when we introduced active timers.

* Performance: If the user does not implement Tick / OnPaint, we now note that in the generated class and configure some flags on the instance to not attempt to ever tick or paint if those were not implemented.

* Added missing resource cleanup code to UMG widgets (ListView, TileView and Slider).

* Attempting to parent multiple widgets (in Hierarchy tree) will no longer crash if parent can only accept fewer child widgets.

* Border widget now correctly updates padding properties.

* DrawLines, DrawFormattedText added to the set of low level painting methods for UMG.

* Relaxed the naming restrictions placed on UMG widgets in the hierarchy by adding a DisplayLabel to UWidgets for editor-friendly naming

* Removed unnecessary check for cleaning up resources when a widget component is about to be destroyed

* The cursor property on widgets now works as it should. You can also call SetCursor and ResetCursor to set it at runtime on any UWidget, or clear your overridden cursor.

* Correctly setting the affected buttons in touch pointer events, restoring input for checkbox/slider on iOS that were only checking the EffectingButton.

* UserWidgets are no longer Focusable by default.  Existing UserWidgets should be unaffected.

* New: Added accessor for reading all neighbors of navmesh poly with their edge data for custom navmesh querying.

* New: Added preferred navigation data class to nav agent properties.

* New: An alternative way of gathering neighbours of a given navmesh poly has been added.

    * The new way is more efficient and returns a set of NavPolyRefs, as opposed to the older version that was fetching portals.

* New: An alternative way to batch point projections to navmesh has been added. This new way supports declaring custom query boxes per batched point.

* New: ARecastNavMesh::OnNavMeshGenerationFinished has been made virtual to make it easier for game-specific navmesh classes to react to navmesh generation completion.

* New: FNavAgentProperties member variable has been added to FPathFindingQuery and is now being reused in pathfinding code instead of previously used blank, locally created FNavAgentProperties instance.

* New: Moved navigation flags from PrimitiveComponent to ActorComponent for simplicity and to avoid some casting

* New: Unnecessary AI navigation-related headers has been removed from Engine.h.

* A bug resulting in NavigationSystem dynamically spawning NavigationData instances, even if game is not configured for runtime navmesh generation, has been fixed.

* Bugfix: Fixed MovingAgent cleanup in NavLinkCustomComponent.

* FNavigationQueryFilter has been made thread-safe.

* NavigationData's cleanup has been fixed to work reliably both when destroyed and when the game ends.

### Animation

* New: Added a stat for the specific component in the parallel evaluation worker thread, improving the quality of stat captures or named event captures

* New: Added buckets to use for update rate optimizations when configuring native parameters so it can be used over a number of mesh categories without stalling important meshes.

* New: Marked AnimNotify_PlayParticleEffect and AnimNotify_PlaySound as MinimalAPI, so they can be cast to outside of the Engine module

* New: UAnimNotifyState_Trail cam now be overriden by native classes as well as blueprint classes.

* Bugfix: Fixed uninitialized variable in FAnimUpdateRateParameters (OptimizeMode now defaults to TrailMode)

* Removed a bogus unguarded dereference of GetWorld() from USkinnedMeshComponent::GetSkeletalMeshResource(), preventing a crash when working with an unregistered component

### Automation

* New: Moved some automation tests into separate test files their respective modules.

* Refactored Async tests; added validation to Void Task test.

* Removed dead UDPMessageSegmenter test

### Blueprints

* New: USCS_Node::ChildNodes is now a private member. Manipulation must be performed via accessor functions.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that caused instanced properties to be cleared on Blueprint compile.

* Made a load warning when a node class is missing more actionable by including the package name in the log output

* Reduced the number of memory allocations done when managing latent actions, and added a stat tracking the time spent in ProcessLatentActions

* Spline Component Get Segment Length now correctly takes into account the world scale of the component. Also exposed UpdateSpline to Blueprints so that the spline can be updated in code after applying a new scale transform.

* UObject::execLocalVariable will no longer crash when there is a type mismatch

#### Core

* New: ABTest command now supports timing a scope rather than the whole frame via SCOPED_ABTEST.

* New: Added [UnrealHeaderTool] MaxLinesPerCpp ini setting to control the maximum number of lines stored in unity files.

* New: Added an FName churn tracker.

* New: Added bAllowShrinking to various TArray heap methods, to allow users to avoid reallocation during removals

* New: Added basic support for loading native Blueprints.

* New: Added basic UObject thread safety checks to UnrealCodeAnalyzer.

* New: Added custom deleter support to TSharedPtr.

* New: Added custom version for engine releases branch.

* New: Added 'debug stackoverflow' console command

* New: Added FastDecimalFormat to provide efficient and culture aware number formatting

* New: Added FindSortedStringCaseInsensitive overload which takes an array type.

* New: Added FPackageName::TryConvertLongPackageNameToFilename

    * This allows you to attempt convert a package name (or path) into a filename (or path) without generating an assert. FPackageName::LongPackageNameToFilename now calls this function and asserts on failure.

* New: Added functions to access low-level file stat data as a single file-system request

    * You can now use GetStatData to get all of the stat data for a file (its timestamps, size, read-only state, and type (file or directory)) in a single file-system request

        * Depending on the platform, this can be much more efficient than making multiple requests

    * This change also adds alternate directory iteration functions (IterateDirectoryStat and IterateDirectoryStatRecursive) for when you need the stat data along with the files/directories on disk

        * For platforms that provide this stat data as part of the low-level directory iteration (such as Windows), this can yield much better performance than making two separate file-system requests

        * Platforms that do not provide this information as part of the directory iteration will just perform a stat request while iterating

* New: Added inline allocator support to TFunction.

* New: Added intrinsic support for FMath::CountLeadingZeros and FMath::CountTrailingZeros on Clang platforms.

* New: Added IsAligned function for testing a pointer's alignment.

* New: Added IsValidLowLevel checks to root set objects when initializing Garbage Collector.

* New: Added macro "logOrEnsureNanError" which either logs an error or triggers an ensure, depending on the value of GEnsureOnNANDiagnostic.

    * CVar "EnsureOnNaNFail" can be used to control this behavior.

* New: Added specific FMath rounding implementations:

    * FMath::RoundHalfToEven

    * FMath::RoundHalfFromZero

    * FMath::RoundHalfToZero

    * FMath::RoundFromZero

    * FMath::RoundToZero

    * FMath::RoundToNegativeInfinity

    * FMath::RoundToPositiveInfinity

* New: Added support for nested serializable objects during conversion to JSON.

* New: Added support for parsing int, signed and unsigned in UnrealHeaderTool.

* New: Added support for regular C++ int types when casting an enum type in the dimension of an array property.

* New: Added Support for RF_Async and RF_AsyncLoading in FReferenceChainSearch::PrintReferencers.

* New: Added support for tracking the total number of objects outside of WITH_EDITOR by defining UE_GC_TRACK_OBJ_AVAILABLE to 1

* New: Added TBitArray::SetRange to set a range of bits to a given state.

* New: Added ToDirectionAndLength() for FVector2D.

* New: Added UDynamicClass for dynamic UObject types

* New: Added write flags support to FFileHelper::SaveArrayToFile and FFileHelper::SaveStringToFile.

* New: Allow development command line options -execcmds, -exec, -vsync, and -novsync to work in Test configuration builds (still disabled in Shipping configuration builds)

* New: Allow memreport to work in Test configuration without requiring UEBuildConfiguration.bUseLoggingInShipping to be true

    * Note: It still requires ALLOW_DEBUG_FILES, and is disabled in the true Shipping configuration

    * Added a new FOutputDeviceArchiveWrapper which doesn't try to do any special work and merely adapts the FOutputDevice API to write to a FArchive

    * Switched UEngine::HandleMemReportDeferredCommand over to use FOutputDeviceArchiveWrapper

* New: Basic support for dynamic UClasses (UClasses that don't need to be constructed at runtime, and can be later removed). Native blueprint support for UnrealHeaderTool.

* New: Blueprint Generated Class references can now be redirected to Native Class references.

* New: CrashReporter - Added a safer method for adding new crashes to the database, should no longer time-out

* New: CrashReporter - Added initial support for the unified crash context

* New: De-templatizied GetPrivateStaticClassBody to help improve compile times.

* New: Engine: Added build configuration (e.g., Development, Test, or Shipping) to the output .log generated for fpscharts

* New: Fixed UHT parsing of PRAGMA_DISABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS and PRAGMA_ENABLE_DEPRECATION_WARNINGS macros.

* New: FReferenceCollector::AddReferenceObjects performance improvements for TArrays

    * AddReferncedObjects will no longer call HandleObjectReference multiple times but instead will call HandleObjectReferences just once (currently only implemented for FGCCollector). Reduces the number of virtual function calls while collecting garbage.

* New: Garbage Collection and WeakObjectPtr optimizations

    * Moved some of the EObjectFlags to EInternalObjectFlags and merged them with FUObjectArray

    * Moved WeakObjectPtr serial numbers to FUObjectArray

    * Added pre-allocated UObject array

* New: Improved "obj list" formatting to make it easier to work with

    * Removed meaningless 'ResourceKB' number (it is never actionable due to double-counting, etc...); ExclusiveResKB is still present and useful

    * Changed all sizes to be float KB instead of int KB (10.2f)

    * Added commas between entries and dropped the K suffixes, to make it easier to import into other software

* New: Initial implementation of makefiles for UnrealHeaderTool - designed to improve programmer iteration times.

* New: Introduced GC UObject clusters. GC clusters provide means to create disregard for garbage collector subsets at load time (e.g. Materials with material expressions and their textures).

* New: LoadClass now provides the same default arguments as LoadObject

* New: Made delegates' Create functions throw a warning when their return value is ignored.

* New: Merged FTlsObjectInitializers with FUObjectThreadcontext to avoid excessive thread local storage lookups when creating UObjects.

* New: Optimized FMemory::Memswap and TSparseArray::Compact.

* New: Optimized FName comparisons to be a single branch.

* New: Optimized function name generation in BindDynamic, AddDynamic, AddUniqueDynamic, RemoveDynamic and IsAlreadyBound in Clang builds.

* New: Optimized TArray and FString ranged-for iteration and added checks to ensure the iterated container isn't modified.

* New: Optimized TSet hashing.

* New: Added FVector::DistSquaredXY helper function

* New: Replaced GetUObjectArray() function calls with GUObjectArray object to avoid redundant function calls in performance sensitive places.

* New: Replaced the checks of duplicate bindings in multicast delegates with ensures.

* New: Tick functions can now have a different start and end group

* New: Turn on async component tick by default. This means any tick function marked as being able to run on any thread will actually do so by default

* New: UnfocusedVolumeMultiplier can now be set programmatically.

* New: UnrealBuildTool: Exposed the ability to disable /largeaddressaware for Win32 compiles (bBuildLargeAddressAwareBinary)

* Bugfix: Fix for implementation of FWindowsPlatformMisc::Is64bitOperatingSystem() which was always returning true.

* Bugfix: Fix multiline comments parsing in UHT, where end of comment was treated as start of one, e.g. /*/ Comment /*/

* Bugfix: Fixed a comment about the return value from FString::Compare.

* Bugfix: Fixed a compile error in one of TUniquePtr's move assignment operators.

* Bugfix: Fixed a lot of Hot-Reload errors.

* Bugfix: Fixed access specifiers dropping from one UCLASS to the next within the same header.

* Bugfix: Fixed an assert that could occur when creating FMemoryArchive objects.

* Bugfix: Fixed an interpolation issue with FRotator.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where commandlets did not load plugin modules with a loading phase of PostEngineInit

* Bugfix: Fixed bug in stack tracker which would not properly zero all unused elements.

* Bugfix: Fixed comparison in FSessionMessageRouter::FSessionChangedDelegatePair::Equals.

* Bugfix: Fixed compilation errors in TCircularQueue::Count.

* Bugfix: Fixed compiler warnings in libJPG with Clang >= 3.7.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in FGCReferenceTokenStream::ReplaceOrAddAddReferencedObjectsCall when using TMap properties.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in TMap range-based-for iteration

* Bugfix: Fixed FArchiveProxy::operator<< return values.

* Bugfix: Fixed FBitReference's assignment operator when assigning from one TBitArray element to another.

* Bugfix: Fixed FCriticalSection::TryLock to retain the lock if successful, rather than immediately releasing it.

* Bugfix: Fixed FString::operator/= adding and extra slash even if the string to be concatenated starts with it.

* Bugfix: Fixed hot reload crashes that were occuring when user added C++ enums to the code.

* Bugfix: Fixed hot reloading on the Mac when building from Xcode.

* Bugfix: Fixed incorrect _MAX values in UEnums.

* Bugfix: Fixed incorrect errors reported by UnrealHeaderTool when const UCLASSes have deprecated properties.

* Bugfix: Fixed LoadObject to also respect the legacy struct's path, which FindObject was already respecting. Moved legacy logic to StaticFindObjectFast that is shared by both functions

* Bugfix: Fixed non-contiguous UUserDefinedEnums.

* Bugfix: Fixed parsing of */// in UnrealHeaderTool.

* Bugfix: Fixed possible memory corruption when using FArchive::SerializeBits.

* Bugfix: Fixed reference controller memory leak in MakeShareable assignment.

* Bugfix: Fixed return value of HexToBytes.

* Bugfix: Fixed some actors being skipped during ULevel::RouteActorInitialize.

* Bugfix: Fixed some inefficient TFunction and TFunctionRef usage.

* Bugfix: Fixed some redundant unsigned comparisons which showed up in static code analysis.

* Bugfix: Fixed some threading problems with MallocBinned stats.

* Bugfix: Fixed the example code in TFunction's comments.

* Bugfix: Fixed TTuple move construction in Visual C++.

* Bugfix: Fixed UnrealHeaderTool metadata when casting a UENUM() value in the bounds of a C++ array UPROPERTY().

* Bugfix: Fixed UnrealHeaderTool not handling explicit constructors.

* Bugfix: Fixed UnrealHeaderTool's parsing of inline keywords in UFUNCTIONs.

* Bugfix: Fixed Visual Studio 2013 Update 5 and Visual Studio 2015 debug visualizers.

* Added an API macro to UMaterialExpressionObjectOrientation.

* Added overload for FMath::RandRange() that takes two floats. Using floats with the int32 version is most often a mistake so this makes the behavior explicit.

* Better detection of hot-reload-from-IDE builds.

* Changed a failure to set a cvar due to a previous set via system settings ini to be displayed as Display instead of Warning

    * Rationale: There is no way in a game to prevent the project settings or scalability from trying to set the value and failing with the message, and a user had to go out of their way to add one and intended them to exist (there's no UI way to set them in this manner in the editor)

* Deprecated FDelegateBase::GetDelegateInstance. This was an internal API that was never intended to be exposed.

* Disabled Hot-Reload functionality in game builds.

* FArchiveReplaceObjectRef will now respect references added through AddReferencedObjects

* FDefferedMessageLog class will now be more thread safe

* ForEachObjectWithOuter now correctly considers children of excluded objects for being operated on.

* [UObjectGlobals] Do not overwrite instanced subobjects with ones from CDO

* Linkers will no longer be reset when renaming objects while post loading blueprints.

* Lowered the priority of task graph threads and added the ability to control this with a console command for testing.

* Made a serialization error about enums more actionable by including the name of the asset being loaded (if there is one)

* Made FCriticalSection non-copyable.

* Made FMath::IsPowerOfTwo a template to allow it to take any integral type.

* Modified GetParamValueIfNotSpecified to return Default value if the param is not part of the command line

* Optimization: Improved FWeakObjectPtr::Get() performance.

    * Inlined some internal functions that were not being inlined. Removed some branches, especially in the common case when bEvenIfPendingKill=false.

* Fix "error: '&' within '|'" in EditorPerformanceTests.cpp when using clang-3.5.2 

* Fixed LogCompile typo: Tabify time was was... 

* Prevented FPaths::MakeStandardFilename from crashing when passed a 1 character string

* Refactored FMallocBinned.

* Removed copies of FD3D12PipelineStateCache now that FCriticalSection is uncopyable.

* Removed deprecated CanConvertPointerFromTo metafunction.

* Removed DiskCachedAssetDataBuffer as it was not strictly necessary and was triggering a crash when loading the cached registry from disk. This data is now stored directly in DiskCachedAssetDataMap. It was already true that this map does not change outside of SerializeCache but now it is critical since NewCachedAssetDataMap keeps pointers directly to its values.

* Removed FNameLookupCPPArchiveProxy as it was not used by anything

* Removed redundant memory allocation when loading empty files in FFileHelper::LoadFileToString.

* Removed unnecessary memory allocations from TMultiMap::MultiFind.

* Removed unnecessary zero-byte allocations from BulkData.

* Removed unused FUntypedBulkData::GetBulkDataResourceMemory and FUntypedBulkData::ShouldFreeOnEmpty functions.

* Replaced some -1s with INDEX_NONEs.

* Stopped FName instances with the same string but different numerical suffixes all getting the same hash

* UnrealHeaderTool: Fixed a bug where some kinds of shadowing would not generate an error (e.g., struct member shadowing), and one where thrown errors would not return a failure code stopping the build

* When cooking by the book, imports that should be excluded from packages for specific targets (i.e. NotForServer imports should not be created for the server cook target) will no longer be created.

* Wrapped all vector library calls to math functions through our FMath versions, so they benefit from fixes or improvements therein. Added Exp2() function.

#### Editor and Tools

* New: Added a complete framework to allow plugins to add their own editor build steps.

    * These can be executed individually (e.g. by selecting an entry in the Build drop down menu), and in the Build All action.

    * Build actions can be registered to run at any point during Build All, except after Lightmass, as Lightmass never calls back to the editor build system to say it's complete.

    * Builds can be asynchronous, like Lightmass, and the system handles continuing Build All after this is complete.

* New: Added option to display installed platform options even if they are not valid for the current project type

    * This is used to show the option to package code projects in the editor, so that it can display a message about it not being available

* New: Added support for OrthoFreelook viewport types when calculating the view rotation matrix for the viewport.

* New: Better display support for Arrays of structs within UDataAssets

    * Added support for optional meta=(TitleProperty="StructPropertyNameHere") tag on properties of type TArray<FSomeStruct>

    * This changes the editor rolled-up display of these values from "{0} members" to a stringified version of the specified property (if found) making it easier to identify the element you want to work with.

    * For example, if your struct has a UPROPERTY called Name you can set that as the TitleProperty to use it as the row summary.

* New: Moved component visualizer headers to the Public folder to allow their use as base classes in project code. Also moved some spline visualizer members from private to protected scope and DLL exported the necessary symbols.

* New: Refactored the way that property keying works in sequencer based tools. Any sequencer code for custom property tracks in either the widget blueprint animation editor or the level sequence editor will need to be updated. This allowed deleting a lot of duplicated complex key behavior code. No data changes are required.

* New: Removed the limitation that BSP must be rebuilt during a transaction.

* New: Slow Task dialogs can now be set to automatically open only after a certain amount of time has passed.

    * This can be useful if it's not necessarily known in advance how long a task will take, but where opening the dialog for only a second or so would be disruptive.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash bug in FEditorFileUtils::AddCheckoutPackageItems when no OutPackagesNotNeedingCheckout array is specified.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that was causing TAssetPtrs to point to the wrong objects during play-in-editor sessions.

* Memory Profiler: Optimized FillActiveCallStackList to avoid frequent reallocations, significantly improving overall token stream parse speed

* Prevented ResaveContent commandlet from resaving all content when passed a PACKAGEFOLDER= directory that contains no assets (it now gracefully exits since there is no work to do)

* Exposing an extenders list for the Play menu in the level editor toolbar for extension.

##### Content Browser

* New: Added a way to handle user-defined drag-drop operations in the SAssetView

    * You can now use FContentBrowserModule::GetAssetViewDragAndDropExtenders to register callbacks that are used by SAssetView to handle custom drag-drop operators.

    * Note: These callbacks are only called if the operation isn't handled by SAssetView itself.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash caused by accessing an invalid string when using the PathChangedDelegate callback

* Bugfix: Fixed the back/forward buttons in the Content Browser not triggering the PathChangedDelegate

#### Gameplay Framework

* New: Addded a method IsLooping to determine whether an AEmiterCameraLensEffectBase object will loop forever

* New: Added FScopedPreventAttachedComponentMove scoping construct which temporarily sets a SceneComponent to use absolute location/rotation/scale to prevent moving when attached to a parent that moves. The flags are then restored after the scope goes away.

    * ComponentToWorld of the child will not change when the parent moves (it shouldn't since it stays at the same location). RelativeLocation, RelativeRotation, and RelativeScale3D will be set to match the absolute flags, which are restored after the scope goes out of context.

    * Optimized SceneComponent::UpdateChildTransforms to do nothing when the child uses all absolute flags.

    * Relocated bWorldToComponentUpdated and bAbsoluteTranslation_DEPRECATED for better cache behavior.

* New: Added SceneComponent::IsQueryCollisionEnabled() and IsPhysicsCollisionEnabled(), since IsCollisionEnabled() is more general than we often want.

    * MoveComponent now only sweeps if query collision is enabled (not just any collision, so now excludes PhysicsOnly collision).

    * UpdateOverlaps now only generates overlaps if query collision is enabled (not just any collision, so now excludes PhysicsOnly collision).

    * A few other locations were changed to only consider query collision, where it didn't make sense to include PhysicsOnly collision.

* New: Added a delegate that can be bound to trigger when a hitch is detected while doing FPSCharts (	UEngine::OnHitchDetectedDelegate)

* New: Added console commands to list components/actors with a given response to any specified profile, and to list profiles with a given response to any specified collision channel. This processes only those assets which have been loaded in to memory so far. New commands are:

    * New commands are listed below. "Response" is one of: Ignore, Overlap, Block. "Profile" is either an index or name from the ListProfiles command. "Channel" is either an index or name from the ListChannels command.

    * Collision.ListProfiles

    * Collision.ListChannels

    * Collision.ListComponentsWithResponseToProfile <Response> <Profile>

    * Collision.ListProfilesWithResponseToChannel <Response> <Channel>

* New: Added FQuat methods GetForwardVector(), GetRightVector(), GetUpVector(). Improve comments for GetAxis[X|Y|Z] and GetRotationAxis().

* New: Added IsLooping() to UCameraShake to indicate when it will loop forever

* New: Added Pawn::IsPlayerControlled() to compliment IsLocallyControlled() (thanks EverNewJoy!)

* New: AnimNotifies for trail effects can recycle ParticleSystemComponents, to avoid spawning them each time and avoid the template setup cost. This is enabled by default.

    * Trails are not limited to PSCs spawned by the trails (though those are preferred), so a persistent effect can be spawned for an actor and reused forever.

    * Optimized some internal functions to avoid dynamic memory allocations. Optimized editor code for trails to avoid creating FText for every update.

* New: Exposed more control over CharacterMovement network smoothing options.

    * Exposed CharacterMovement network smoothing options in new enum ENetworkSmoothingMode.

    * Exposed more tunable parameters to network smoothing.

    * Refactored SmoothClientPosition() to use two helper functions SmoothClientPosition_Interpolate and SmoothClientPosition_UpdateVisuals.

        * This allows custom code to selectively only update interpolation values and not push transform updates if they use custom throttling or culling code.

* New: Fixed multiple bugs related to creating more than one UWorld within one game engine instance.

    * Using multiple UWorlds with UGameEngine is still very experimental, and your mileage may vary.

* New: Gameplay Abilities: Added the ability to flag a pin as requiring a connection on a latent ability call (meta=(RequiresConnection="true") on the delegate property)

* New: Improved and optimized FQuat::FindBetween() and add some Vector->Orientation functions that include Quat results.

    * Added FindBetweenNormals() and FindBetweenVectors() to indicate different input length requirements. Old FindBetween() previously assumed normalized input, new one does not, but is still faster.

    * Converted most uses of FQuat::FindBetween to FQuat::FindBetweenNormals where the inputs are known to be normalized.

    * Added FVector::ToOrientationQuat. This preserves the up vector (result has no roll).

    * Added FVector::ToOrientationRotator, matching FVector::Rotation implementation.

* New: New virtual function added to AController to GetMinRespawnDelay

* New: Significance Manager is an experimental plugin that provides a framework to help manage the significance of objects based on user view location(s) and based on that significance make decisions about LOD, tick frequency, whether effects should be spawned, sounds played, and other performance related decisions.

* New: Spawning an actor will now respect any default transform on a native root component.

* New: Split UCharacterMovementComponent::VerifyClientTimeStamp to have "checking" logic in a new IsClientTimeStampValid (const) function and have non-const ServerData.CurrentClientTimeStamp reset within the Verify function so that external code can check client timestamp validity without side-effects (also moved logging)

    * Moved UCharacterMovementComponent::PackYawAndPitchTo32 to a static function in header to be able to be accessed outside of CharacterMovementComponent.cpp (for project-specific child classes)

* New: Systems can now register with AHUD::OnShowDebugInfo to provide additional showdebug categories and details.

* New: There is now an override of UGameplayStatics::SpawnEmitterAtLocation that takes a transform rather than separate rotation and location.

* New: UActorComponent::OnComponentDestroyed now takes a boolean parameter that indicates whether the entire Actor that owns the component is being destroyed at once or if the component is being destroyed independently.

    * This can be used to avoid expensive operations like individually detaching scene components for an entire hierarchy that is being destroyed at once.

* New: You can now bind double "click" events for touch inputs.

* Bugfix: Fixed rare crash in AGameplayAbilityTargetActor that occurred with an invalid OwningAbility.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in GetPlayerControllerFromNetId if the player state's unique ID is not valid.

* Bugfix: Fixed UCharacterMovementComponent::ApplyRepulsionForce() using the overlap body index incorrectly. Fixes pushing wrong bodies on skeletal mesh components with multi-body overlap enabled.

* Bugfix: Fixed ensure triggering in PIE/editor shutdown cases with AGameplayAbilityTargetActor: Only attempt to unbind confirm/cancel callbacks if we bound them succesfully in the first place

* Bugfix: Fixed non-normalized Quats from character network smoothing causing NaN errors.

* Bugfix: Fixed UAbilitySystemComponents always ticking even if they don't need to

* Bugfix: Fixed UGameplayCueManager handling GameplayCues when world is tearing down (especially during PIE exit) - safety check

* Bugfix: Fixed up uses of library math functions to go through our FMath namespace so they benefit from fixes or improvements.

* Bugfix: Fixed UPrimitiveComponent::GetCollisionShape not correctly enforcing bounds limits to reject negative sizes when inflation is used.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug in FInterpCurve::InaccurateFindNearestOnSegment where it wasn't finding nearest points on the closing segment of a looped spline.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug where UGameplayAbility::SetShouldBlockOtherAbilities() could run on an ability that is no longer active

* Bugfix: Fixed bug with optimized MarkActorComponentForNeededEndOfFrameUpdate.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in CheckStillInWorld after Actor has been destroyed or is not in the world.

* Bugfix: Fixed excessive allocation in gameplaytags and gameplayeffects subsystems.

* Bugfix: Fixed linear searches of component updates.

* Bugfix: Fixed OnComponentCreated not always being called before RegisterComponent().

* Bugfix: Fixed possible crash in Particles by checking for nullptr

* Bugfix: Fixed replicated transforms not being updated on clients until the next transform or replication update.

* Bugfix: Fixed some compiler warnings in FInputActionKeyMapping struct

* Added FCollisionQueryParams::ClearIgnoredComponents and SetNumIgnoredComponents.

* Added check for valid AWorldSettings to UWorld::IsPaused

* Added DestroyActiveState to AbilitySystemComponent so unregistering the component while in-flight abilities are active do not crash.

    * Added option for reusing player states when they become inactive instead of duplicating them via OnDeactivated and OnReactivated methods.

* Added NaN checking to FVector::Rotation and AController::GetControlRotation and make NaN logging in FQuat::Rotator() more verbose. Tweaked FQuat::ToString() to display more precision.

* Changed game thread tasks to be high priority. The renderer is generally more tolerant of task latency so this helps keep things running smoothly.

* Changed the timer manager to be grow-only, avoiding reallocs due to expiring timers, etc...

* Disabled RVO avoidance registration on network clients, and made a note of it only running on the server. It already did not update velocities on clients anyway.

* Disabled ticking by default for ACameraActor as there is no work to be done per-tick (subclasses can still set it)

* Do not crash when PlayerController is given a LocalPlayer in commandlet mode

* Ensure that we pass a valid delta time to UCharacterMovementComponent::CalcRootMotionVelocity()

* FloatingPawnMovement uses faster FQuat code path for movement.

* FMath::Atan2() no longer calls atan2f() because of some compiler or library bugs causing it to randomly return NaN for valid input.

    * It now uses a high-precision minimax approximation instead, measured to be 2x faster than the stock C version.

* GetAttachParentSocketName now returns the correct information.

* Inlined SceneComponent::GetAttachParent() and added GetAttachSocketName().

* Made FQuat::DiagnosticCheckNaN() const and added a call to it in FQuat::Rotator().

* Made FVector::IsUniform() just call AllComponentsEqual(), as the old implementation was similar but allowed 2*Tolerance difference between X and Z.

* Made various FQuat interpolation methods normalize output by default. Added versions that do not normalize if that is desired.

    * Added FQuat::Slerp_NotNormalized() and made current FQuat::Slerp() always normalize output. FQuat::FastLerp() remains unchanged (does not normalize).

    * Added FQuat::SlerpFullPath_NotNormalized() and made current FQuat::SlerpFullPath() always normalize output.

* Moved AttachmentReplication update out of SceneComponent and to ActorReplication. It only needs to be done on the network authority and only for the root component, and replication updates is a better place to check this.

* Network attachment uses less bandwidth when root component is attached and is set to replicate. Actor no longer replicates redundant AttachmentReplication struct in this case.

* Optimization: avoid calling USceneComponent::UpdateChildTransforms() when there are no children.

* Optimization: Inlined ACharacter methods: GetMesh(), GetCharacterMovement(), GetCapsuleComponent(), GetArrowComponent().

* Optimization: reduce calls to GetNetMode() in CharacterMovementComponent. Some cases can be replaced by much simpler net Role checks.

* Optimization: removed the need for APawn to implement Tick().

    * Moved RemoteViewPitch update to Pawn::PreReplication() from Tick().

* Optimization: Stop ticking particle systems on the dedicated server if they are not enabled, rather than bailing out of the tick each time.

* Optimized FCollisionQueryParams::AddIgnoredActor() and AddIgnoredComponents().

* Optimized FDynamicMeshEmitterData::GetParticleTransform() to avoid needless Quat->Rotator and Rotator->Matrix conversions.

* Optimized USceneComponent::CalcNewComponentToWorld() to take a faster path when there is no parent.

* Optimized allocations in UpdatePrimitiveAttachment.

* Optimized character net location update and mesh interpolation to cause fewer transform updates, especially on the mesh.

    * Added Character::bClientCheckEncroachmentOnNetUpdate to control whether we care about checking for encroachment when we get a new network location.

* Optimized character smoothing code to avoid SmoothClientPosition() calls once the target mesh offset has been reached.

    * New flag bNetworkSmoothingComplete indicates whether smoothing has reached the destination. This is set to false when a new network position is received.

    * Also fixes trying to smooth rotation towards identity rotation before receiving network updates.

    * Deprecated FNetworkPredictionData_Client_Character::CurrentSmoothTime in favor of saving last update time, to prevent needing to update time every tick (since we skip updates now).

* Optimized CharacterMovementComponent mesh interpolation on clients to only perform one chain of transform updates when using linear smoothing, rather than separately rotating the capsule and then translating the mesh.

* Optimized component registration to avoid useless DetachFromParent() for the same pending AttachParent during registration. Added missing UpdateOverlaps() when detaching from object simulating physics.

* Optimized FTransform::Equals().

    * Check translation first as it's a simpler test and more likely to differ.

    * Scale3D test is now per-component rather than a dot product test versus tolerance.

* Optimized particle systems to avoid useless detach/attach during registration when bAutoManageAttachment is enabled and the particle system auto-activates.

* Optimized some low level checks used to support Object and Actor networking

    * Optimized UObject::IsNameStableForNetworking() to check cheap flags first before expensive IsDefaultSubObject().

    * Optimized UActorComponent::IsSupportedForNetworking() to check GetIsReplicated() before IsNameStableForNetworking(), and inlined GetIsReplicated().

* Optimized usage of FHitResult during movement, and added functions to better control initialization of the struct.

    * Avoid initializing FHitResult in PrimitiveComponent::MoveComponentImpl when it's not used.

    * Added Init() functions to FHitResult and use them to avoid Construct + Copy in a few places.

    * Added ENoInit constructor for FHitResult.

* Optimized usage of some collision profiles to use existing static FNames rather than names defined at the call sites.

* Optimized VInterpNormalRotationTo() to use faster FQuat::RotateVector() rather than converting to matrix first.

* Projectile uses faster FQuat code path when passing rotation to MoveComponent.

* Remove duplicate AHUD:DrawText function that uses different co-ordinates

* Removed a few allocations from the tick task manager.

* Removed collision from DefaultPhysicsVolume. It doesn't have collision geometry but can show up in global lists of actors with collision enabled.

* Removed misleading/incorrect duplicate signature comments from the FGameDelegates delegate declarations, replacing them with inline parameter names

* Removed some branches from character movement ticks, conditionally call some virtual functions, and add a stat counter to UCharacterMovementComponent::SmoothCorrection.

* Set sensible default parameters for APlayerController::ClientPlayCameraAnim and APlayerController::ClientPlayCameraShake

* Simulated root motion in CharacterMovementComponent uses FScopedMovementUpdate for cheaper movement.

* Smooth Z location during Character simulated mesh interpolation just like all other axes.

* TActorIterator now properly filters out Actors in hidden levels the same as FActorIterator

* UCharacterMovementComponent no longer replicates moves to the server if its character's Player is null, which can be the case if the local player has enabled the debug camera.

    * Prevents "no owning connection" warning spam for ServerMove RPCs.

* Updated async trace handling to accept trace requests more widely. Avoids potential issues when poorly-timed requests would come in.

* UPlayerInput::GetInvertAxisKey and InvertAxisKey fixed to work consistently with Mouse Sensitivity.

* When clearing a PlayerController's spectator pawn, use regular pawn for attachment and auto-managed camera target if regular pawn has already been set up.

#### Localization

* New: Added string formatting methods for internationalization metadata.

* New: Added support for detecting the reading direction of text

    * This uses the ICU BiDi functionality (where available) to detect whether text is left-to-right, right-to-left, or mixed, and in the mixed case, can give you a breakdown of the direction of each sub-section of text.

* Bugfix: Fixed a double FText history allocation in AsNumber, AsPercent, AsCurrency, AsDate, AsTime, AsDateTime, and Format

* Added caching for LOCTEXT

    * Previously, each call to LOCTEXT would create a new FText instance, which involved several allocations and map look-ups. This change aims to allow repeated calls to LOCTEXT to return the same FText instance while also performing zero allocations as part of the look-up. In a synthetic test, this has been shown to yield a 6.5x increase in performance.

    * This has other side effects where LOCTEXT was being used in a Slate attribute, as it means the text layout can perform a fast pointer comparison (which will pass, as both will now point to the same instance), rather than a slower string comparison.

* Blueprint pin property tool tips are no longer gathered for localization unless gathering of editor text is specified.

* FText::AsMemory now takes a uint64 rather than a SIZE_T

    * This allows it to format 64-bit size values in 32-bit builds, which is needed to correctly display file and drive sizes.

* Minimized FText allocations when generating text at runtime

    * Text that is generated at runtime (such as via FText::AsNumber) now allocates its string and history together in a single allocation.

    * Profiling shows that this almost negates the cost of the text history, without having to remove the text history (which is essential for FText serialization).

* Some performance improvements for FText::Format (in Blueprints)

    * FFormatArgumentData now uses an FString (rather than an FText) as its ArgumentName. This avoids the extra cost associated with creating an FText instance.

    * FFormatTextArgument has been replaced with a UHT exposed version of FFormatArgumentData. This avoids an extra array conversion in UKismetTextLibrary::Format when using the format text node in Blueprints.

    * UK2Node_FormatText now stores its pin names (extracted from the format string) as FString rather than FText.

* Some performance improvements for FText::Format.

    * FText::Format which takes an array of FFormatArgumentData no longer converts that into a temporary TMap.

    * FTextFormatHelper::Format no longer allocates an FString for the argument, and instead passes a lightweight FTextFormatHelper::FArgumentName.

#### Networking

* New: Added IsDedicatedServerInstance() to UGameInstance. Returns true if running a dedicated server of any kind (PlayInEditor, Server exe, Editor as Server, etc).

* New: Added "-notimeouts" commandline argument to prevent UNetDriver class from timing out net connections during development. Works with UPartyBeaconHost as well.

* New: Added "PostRepNotifies()" event to Objects, called after any rep notifies may be triggered.

* New: Added a lobby framework entirely using beacons. Supports a similar workflow to the AGameMode/AGameState/APlayerController/APlayerState actors to create a way for clients to connect and interact with a server without being fully committed to loading the server map.

* New: Added an initial implementation of an InMemoryNetworkReplayStreaming module.

    * Unlike NullNetworkReplayStreaming and HttpNetworkReplayStreaming, this implementation doesn't rely on the disk or network, and as a result is generally much faster.

    * It is intended to be used for specific cases where a local, transient replay would be useful.

* New: Added DestroyNetworkActorHandled function to overload special behavior in AActor::DestroyActor. APlayerControllers and UOnlineBeacons will mark the UNetConnection bPendingDestroy so that the actor will timeout and cleanup shortly.

* New: Added new USE_SERVER_PERF_COUNTERS define to enable use of perf counters in networked related code.

* New: Beacon types are set by their UObject class name rather than specified by developers. This will prevent accidental incompatibility with derived child classes.

* New: Moved "use short connection timeout" feature into its own function. This is used by the net driver to determine when to move from UNetDriver::InitialConnectTimeout to UNetDriver::ConnectionTimeout. During normal gameplay this is when APlayerController has been replicated/acknowledged by the client. For beacons, it is when the connection has been opened by the server and the first server Remote Procedure Call (RPC) has been sent.

* New: The NullNetworkReplayStreaming implementation can now play back live games. This is useful for testing with multiple instances of the game running on the same machine.

* New: The replay streamer implementation module to use can now be overridden at runtime.

    * You can pass the name of the module to use into FNetworkReplayStreaming::GetFactory, or you can use the "ReplayStreamerOverride=" URL option. The URL option is useful when combined with the "DemoRec" URL option.

    * If neither of these overrides is provided, the implementation will fall back to the one defined by the "DefaultFactoryName" in the Engine configuration file, as before.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug which caused the incorrect IRepChangedPropertyTracker to be passed to the UActorComponent::PreReplication function during replay recording. The tracker is now correctly looked up in the demo net driver instead of the game net driver.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue that could cause the value of AWorldSettings::WorldGravityZ to not be applied on clients after it changed on the server.

* Client beacons now properly use the "short connection timeout" feature which switches between UNetDriver InitialConnectTimeout and ConnectionTimeout values after the beacon is properly connected to the server. Additionally made sure to set beacon socket state to USOCK_Open at the proper time.

* GetNetMode() now correctly returns NM_DedicatedServer instead of NM_Standalone for Actor's on a dedicated server if the netdriver has been disconnected.

* Improved server log message for a failed RPC when the actor's level isn't ready on a client

* LogNet message "Adding actor NetGUID" verbosity changed to VeryVerbose

* Reduced incremental allocations in FClassNetCacheMgr::GetClassNetCache

#### Online

* New: A join-in-progress user can now be associated to a specific replay by calling the INetworkReplayStreamer::AddUserToReplay function.

* New: Add GetAuthType function to IOnlineIdentity that corresponds to account mapping on MCP (for example PSN accounts use "PSN")

* New: Added a basic URLDecode implementation to the FGenericPlatformHttp class.

* New: Added a new (currently optional) delegate to the end of the Online DestroySession call. This will be the preferred method for programmer initiated asynchronous calls to be checked for completion. Events will still be multicast delegates. A future engine change will include changes for more interfaces.

* New: Added an "run exec command" endpoint to the perfcounter query port. "/exec?c=<cmd>" will execute any command. "-StatsPort=XXX" will enable this (and explicitly checks for messages from localhost only).

* New: Added generic UrlDecode function for decoding a string that has been URL encoded.

* New: Added GetPartyLeader() function to party beacon class for access to a party leader for a given unique id in an existing party.

* New: Added IsLoaded function to online subsystem utils for determining the availability of specified online subsystem

* New: Added LoadDefaultSubsystem and ReloadDefaultSubsystem functions to OnlineSubsystem (OSS). Used to reset OSS in Play In Editor (PIE) when changing login settings.

* New: Added new accessor function GetGameInstance to OnlineSessionClient class

* New: Added two new session search comparison operators NOT_IN and IN. Expects string of values of the form [value1;value2;value3]. Additionally added EXCLUDEUNIQUEIDS to exclude sessions with specific registered users. Format is [userid1;userid2]. Neither feature is guaranteed to be supported on all platforms.

* New: BuildPatchServices now has new retry logic for downloads with access to download health information

* New: BuildPatchServices: Ability to remove a custom field from a manifest

* New: BuildPatchServices: Chunk recognition can now verify a match using just SHA1 rather than comparing actual chunk data

* New: BuildPatchServices: Tagged installation support. BuildPatchTool can now take information in the file attributes data that optionally tags certain files with custom keywords. These keywords can be used when creating an installer in order to filter the list of files that will get downloaded and installed.

* New: Custom events can be added to replays! These events contain a group, metadata, and data. The group is used when enumerating events, metadata will eventually be used to filter within a group, and the data contains an extra information relevant to the specific event. See the DemoNetDriver AddEvent and EnumerateEvents functions for more details.

* New: FStructSerializer: Values can be filtered by a predicate to control which properties are serialized

* New: ImageWrapper now uses the file header to auto-detect the image format

* New: OnlineSubsystem session interface DestroySession call now takes a completion delegate parameter that will only fire for that call. This is in addition to any delegates specified in the corresponding AddDelegate call. Future refactor is planned to add this kind of completion delegate to all OnlineSubsystem calls and deprecate the Add/ClearDelegate paradigm where possible.

* New: Speed up online subsystem accessors when not in Development or Play In Editor builds

* New: SWebBrowser: Added support for returning arrays from UFunctions to javascript code running inside browser widgets

* New: The names for the different online subsystems have been moved into their own file, OnlineSubsystemNames.h, so they can be referenced even if their corresponding subsystems aren't being used.

* New: UParty::Init, UParty::CreatePersistentParty, and UParty::LeavePersistentParty are now virtual.

* New: Updates to the PerfCounter module to improve a very basic http endpoint that allows a GET verb and simple "exec" execution on the local ip.

* New: Use App Id terminology instead of Client Id.

* New: WebBrowser cleanup and fixes

    * WebBrowser now caches content and persists cookies on disk when requested by server

    * WebBrowser will include the engine version and product name in the UserAgent http request header sent to the server

    * Using the WebBrowser module will no longer change the name of the Game thread when initialized

* New: WebBrowser enhancements and fixes

    * Created a minimal SWebBrowserView widget for showing a web browser without any additional UI

    * Improved rendering performance for web pages containing a lot of animation

    * IWebBrowserWindow has a new method to query the last (CEF) load error code

    * SSL certificate errors now get reported as load errors instead of being silently ignored

    * Added IWebBrowser::GetSource to access the source text of the currently loaded page

    * A few multithreading issues have been fixed by ensuring that most callbacks and events are always invoked on the game thread

* New: WebBrowser updated CEF to branch 2357, commit hash 47e6d4bf84444eb6cb4d4509231a8c9ee878a584

* New: WebBrowser: Add a way to delete cookies from code.

* New: WebBrowser: Added possibility of customizing how to show browser dialogs.

* New: WebBrowser: Allow passing TMap<FString,T> as arguments to FWebBrowserJSFunction objects

* New: WebBrowser: Functions exposed to JavaScript can now take a FWebJSResponse argument for passing results to the caller on the JS side. Allowing for raising error conditions and implementing asynchronous results.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that would prevent HTTP retries from working. TimeSinceLastResponse was not getting reset with ElapsedTime so once a request timed out it would always time out N more times until the retry sys gives up

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash that could occur in OnlineSubsystemNull's implementation of the IOnlineSession::CancelFindSessions() function.

* Bugfix: Fixed a possible string buffer overflow issue in Steam matchmaking code when processing advertised keys.

* Bugfix: Fixed many crashes and inefficiencies with the party system that occur after the online subsystem enters a disconnected state.

* Bugfix: Fixed party framework to make sure that only one UObject for a party member is created between "joined" and "data received" delegates firing. Fixes possible race condition that would create two instead.

* Bugfix: Fixed possible buffer overflow issue in Steam implementation when using FCString::Strcpy (replaced with FCString::Strncpy)

* Bugfix: Fixed SWebBrowserView destructor to unbind its own delegate handlers and not event handlers owned by other objects

* BuildPatchServices: Download code for file protocols now use Thread Pool to load the files rather than one at a time.

* Moved all platform http headers into the http module and out of core. Wasn't possible to export any of the platform implementations because of the improper mix of CORE_API and HTTP_API declarations.

* Online subsystem delegate handles are cleared with passed to any of the clear delegate functions.

* Online subsystem delegate handles are now invalidated inside the ClearX_Handle calls.

* Party framework added a new error code for UnknownParty and properly uses it in the various API callbacks.

* test bResult instead of bSucceeded in GenerateExchangeCode_HttpRequestComplete

* Voice interface can run while on dedicated server but skips various calls that are only needed on client. Updates to generic voice implementation initialization to improve warnings/logging.

* WebBroser: Passing UStruct parameters to FWebJSFunction objects will copy them by value instead of (potentially dangling) pointers

* WebBrowser: Patches to CEF

    * Remove confusing error about renderer not being sandboxed, as that is always expected.

    * Work around a crash caused by Lavasoft WebCompanion on 64 bit Windows 8 or 10

#### Other

* New: Added bDrawShadow option to HUD DebugText so we can set shadow per debug line instead of it only being a per-HUD setting

* New: Added pre-compiled versions of Developer modules for the Editor so that other projects can make use of them

#### Paper2D

* Removed an unnecessary per-world tick function when Paper2D is enabled

#### Physics

* New: Add a special IgnoreMask set of bits to help refine scene queries. Helpful for team based filtering.

* New: Add setting to turn CCD off for the entire scene.

* New: Added project setting to force CCD off. Can save about 0.5ms

* New: Added the ability to turn on release physx libs for all configurations. Look for bUseShippingPhysXLibraries

* New: Added the ability to use CHECKED physx libs. Look for bUseCheckedPhysXLibraries

    * Twitch support is still under development and not fully supported yet.

    * Also, refactored the TwitchLiveStreaming plugin so that third party files and binaries are part of the plugin itself

* Added clang 3.7.0 -Wshift-negative-value ignore in JpegImageWrapper.cpp 

##### Android

* New: The shader platform SP_OPENGL_ES2 has been renamed to SP_OPENGL_ES2_ANDROID in the C++ source code to better reflect that it is used only on Android.

* New: Visual Studio project generation was modified to add support for Nsight Tegra.

* Reworked Android In App Purchase Code for Google play store to fit with the latest Google doc.

##### Mac

* New: Added PauseBatching to pause and ResumeBatching to resume the ShaderCache's shader precompilation as well as NumShaderPrecompilesRemaining which returns how many shaders remain to be processed.

    * Games can use these functions to suspend precompilation temporarily when the performance impact would be inappropriate and display progress when active.

* New: Added support for AddressSanitizer in UE4 via the Xcode project settings.

    * When AddressSanitizer is enabled in the target's Scheme in Xcode the build will compile and link with the AddressSanitizer libraries to instrument all memory allocations.

    * This requires a full rebuild of all source files and will also disable compiler optimizations to prevent reporting of errors caused by clang erroneously optimizing away the AddressSanitizer instrumentation.

    * The UE4_FORCE_MALLOC_ANSI environment variable must be enabled separately for AddressSanitizer to catch all possible memory errors.

* New: Added support for calling FOnGetContent in FSlateMacMenu

* New: Added support for ShaderPipeline's to the ShaderCache to allow pre-linking of OpenGL shaders into programs prior to rendering.

    * This ensures that all shaders and programs/pipelines are fully constructed prior to entering gameplay without needing to play through the game first, which will significantly reduce the number and severity of runtime hitching due to shaders.

    * Due to the nature of shader/program/pipeline construction this specific aspect of the ShaderCache can only function on OpenGL at present.

* New: Added the ShaderCacheTool command-line program which can merge shader cache files generated on different machines to make it easier for developers to ship a populated cache with their games.

* New: Changed XcodeSourceCodeAccessor to use xcode-select to find Xcode app

* New: Improved the way dSYMs are generated on Mac, so that we don't move them around but rather create them at the desired destination. Cleaned up the output from dSYM generation as well.

* Bugfix: Fixed .uproject detection in the Xcode project generator

* Bugfix: Fixed product name for DebugGame Editor configuration in Xcode project

* Added implementation of FPlatformProcess::UserTempDir()

* Bind the index buffer as vertex attribute 0 when performing an attribute-less draw call to work around incorrect gl_VertexID values on NVIDIA drivers rather than using different index buffers.

* Detect when UE4 Mac is running under apitrace and fallback to using NSView rather than CoreAnimation to display so that tracing OpenGL works.

* Improved error handling in Mac media player

* Increment frame number & call Begin/EndFrame during loading screen movie playback so that RHI implementations can manage their internal resources correctly.

* Make UE4 on Mac warn about attempts to free memory with the MallocBinned allocator that wasn't allocated from it to avoid crashing on mismatched allocations and make such errors debuggable.

* Retain flow-control statements in Mac OpenGL at the request of Apple/vendors as they feel it should be faster.

* Update Distcc/DMUCS integration which requires explicit specification of the correct DistProp & server for DMUCS while the number of build hosts can be supplied via Xcode on OS X.

* When compiling shaders to GLSL append the source shader name when debug info (r.Shaders.KeepDebugInfo) is enabled to make shaders easier to debug.

##### Playstation 4

* New: Added platform interforce for SHA256 computation and support for /download0 as 'GamePeristentDownloadDir' on PS4.

* New: Added PS4 support for starting/stopping Razor profiler

    * Use SCOPE_PROFILER_INCLUDER and SCOPE_PROFILER_EXCLUDER for this

    * Note: Currently PS4 has no API for pausing and resuming Razor, so profling will be stopped after your scope ends

* New: Added r.PS4DumpExportStats 1 to dump in-game shader interpolator stats; requires r.PS4StripExtraShaderBinaryData=0

* New: Added some extra logging to FOnlineAsyncTaskPS4SessionCreate::DoWork() to help diagnose NP session creation errors.

* New: Added support for compressed vertex shader outputs using r.PS4PackParameters and related macros

* New: CPU memory prefetch function FPlatformMisc::Prefetch implemented for PS4.

* New: Fetch shaders now live in Garlic memory for better performance.

* New: FindSessionById is now implemented on PS4, so the session info for a specific session can be retrieved.

* New: Small optimization to PS4 math functions in FPS4PlatformMath.

* New: Updating the changeable session data on NP sessions is now possible by calling FOnlineSessionPS4::UpdateSession.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash during GPU allocator destruction.

* Added extra GPU pools to reduce memory waste on PS4.

* Decreased command buffer allocator size to reduce parallel rendering memory waste.

* Did minor optimizations to the PS4 RHI and drawlists.

* Leaving a room now uses the async task queue.

    * Also, some incorrect return values for FOnlineSessionPS4::DestroySession have been fixed.

* Removed the OnConnectionStatusChanged callback in PS4 session subsystem since it was empty.

##### HTML5

* Bugfix: Fixed windows centric path separator and user's "home" path to support osx too

* Bugfix: libwebsocket for VS 2015 fixed to be functional again

* Removed the read only file attribute before copy during HTML5 packaging

* Removed deprecated function block that prevents cooking all maps during HTML5 packaging

##### Windows

* Bugfix: Fix to allow launching of external links to work with older versions of Internet Explorer 8.

#### Programming

* New: Added a function to compare how closely two gameplay tags match. Calling GameplayTagsMatchDepth will return an integer representing how many terms in the tags matched. Higher values match more closely than lower values. This may be used to help find the best match when matches are allowed to include parent tags.

* New: Compile times: Unity builds are now more deterministic

    * Before creating unity blobs, we now sort all full file paths alphabetically. This allows for better build system determinism across computers

* New: GitHub users can now exclude binary files from download by adding a .gitdepsignore file in the root of the repository. Syntax is the same as a normal .gitignore file.

* New: Included UE4.natvis file into the Visual Studio Engine Project to allow for easier debugging

* New: Merged most of the base pass static mesh draw lists into a single draw list, by using a common set of parameters for all light map policies.

    * The new parameters are regrouped into a uniform buffer.

* New: Runtime dependencies may now be flagged as optional from .build.cs files, so they won't cause an error if missing when trying to package.

* New: ShaderCompileWorker is automatically built as a dependency of the editor. To disable this behavior, set bEditorDependsOnShaderCompileWorker to false in the UEBuildConfiguration setting of your BuildConfiguration.xml file.

* New: The editor will no longer display an error message when compiling the project on startup if the -unattended switch is present.

* New: Unreal Build Tool: Output total number of actions to execute when building

* New: UnrealBuildTool can now be used to check that a single source file compiles. To use, set up a key binding from your IDE to launch UnrealBuildTool with the a command line of the format: '<ProjectName> <Platform> <Configuration> -singlefile=<FileName>'.

* New: UnrealVS now supported on Windows 10 without .NET 4.5 or older versions of the framework.

* New: Using the -precompile option with UnrealBuildTool will now build all engine modules. Overriding the GetModulesToPrecompile() function from a game's target rules is no longer necessary, and has been deprecated.

* Bugfix: Fixed issue with multiple projects sharing a file in the Engine's Intermediate directory

* Bugfix: Fixed performance automation tests unavailable in Test build configurations

    * Automation features are no longer compiled out in Test configuration at runtime (except in Shipping).

    * Also, enabled automation tests to be triggered from in-game console in non-editor builds (automation controller is enabled)

* Bugfix: Fixed Unreal Header Tool being compiled with older compiler (VS 2013) when actually targeting Visual Studio 2015Compile times

* Bugfix: Fixed game plugin modules not able to use engine shared PCHs

    * This change greatly improves compile times for game plugin modules

    * Game modules never depend on the game itself, so there was no reason not to use shared PCHs by default

* Cooking from the editor will only compile UAT scripts for the current project, excluding other projects under the same engine root.

* Unreal Build Tool: Fixed XGE console output visible even when XGE is not available

* Updated the UnrealBuildTool project file to prevent rule set warnings.

#### Rendering

* New: Added a path so that texture streaming can avoid flushing the RHI thread.

* New: Added -forcerhibypass command line to skip using RHI command list

* New: Added support for built-in samplers (not needing a shader parameter) on platforms that support it

* New: Added support for running the platform shader compiler for one usf file off the dumped usf using ShaderCompileWorker with -directcompile

* New: End of frame updates now optionally can do the gamethread updates while we are doing parallel updates. The relevant cvars are AllowAsyncRenderThreadUpdates and AllowAsyncRenderThreadUpdatesDuringGamethreadUpdates. The latter is disabled by default.

* New: Exposed GetVectorParameterByName and GetScalarParameterByName on UMaterialParameterCollection as DLL exported methods

* New: Reworked task graph in many, many ways. Most of the changes are really only enabled for the PS4 at this point, but will over time migrate to all platforms. After that, there is much cleanup to do.

* Bugfix: Eliminated a fatal error for FD3D11DynamicRHI::RHIGetAvailableResolutions in the case of running over remote desktop.

* Bugfix: Fixed a few places that would assert in single threaded rendering. And fixed separate translucency without a render thread but with parallel rendering.

* Bugfix: Fixed a messed up format specifier in the "Built static mesh" log message

* Bugfix: Fixed an assert in debug console and fixed a crash on disabling deferred contexts.

* Bugfix: Fixed async RHI thread dispatch and enabled it on one of our games. Added passthrough functions for several RHI create functions and implemented them as non-stalling on the PS4.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in FDeferredShadingSceneRenderer::ShouldPrepareDistanceFields() due to null access violation (Scene->FXSystem was null). Also fixed possible crashes if the scene itself was null or if the Views array was empty.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in MediaTexture on dedicated servers during PostLoad. Shouldn't be initialized on servers at all.

* Bugfix: Fixed end of frame updates not being sent for reflection captures.

* Bugfix: Fixed lazy uniform buffer updates to actually be effective.

* Bugfix: Fixed live streaming bug with creating RHI resource on game thread (instead of render thread)

* Bugfix: Fixed memory leak in the view state.

* Bugfix: Fixed rare bug with bogus preshadows ending up with "cull none". Added checks to make sure that never happens.

* Bugfix: Fixed separate translucency in parallel, but without a rendering thread and added some protection to UnresolvedTargets.

* Bugfix: Fixed SpeedTree using an uninitialized uniform buffer.

* Added a more actionable error message to a check() failure for a FStaticLightingMesh that has already been processed when building lighting in a map that contains HLOD

* Allow DirectionalLightComponent to be subclassed outside Engine module

* Allow WindDirectionalSourceComponent to be subclassed outside Engine module.

* CalcTextureMipMapSize3D and CalcTextureMipMapSize now round up instead of down so that they will no longer return zero size values for small texture sizes.

* Changed the RHI thread dispatch tasks to be run on the RHI thread when we are doing async dispatch.

* Disabled parallel occlusion cull and added option for hipri tasks for parallel occlusion cull.

* Dynamically set stream source to avoid creating a separate drawing policy for each static mesh with vertex colors.

* Made the api consistent for FShaderResource::Get*Shader() methods

* Moved shader working dir to the OS temp directory on windows to avoid problems with this being in dropbox or other shared folders.

* New option for cmdlist balancing which is faster and doesn't take task thread resources.

    * We approximate the balance from the last frame.

* Removed fencing on volatile and write only vertex and index buffer locks.

##### FX

* New: Added UParticleSystem::IsLooping to indicate if any enabled emitters will loop forever

    * It is currently calculated during PostLoad() and BuildEmitters(), not serialized

* Bugfix: Fixed crash with clipped subuvs.

##### Optimizations

* New: Added support for FShaderPipeline and removing unused interpolators in a pipeline

* New: Increased max threads for task graph and added a way to reduce task threads at runtime for testing the optimal number. Added ability to change thread affinities on the fly so they can be tuned. Added a way to track excessive allocation at runtime without using the memory profiler: LogGameThreadMallocChurn.Enable. Fixed excessive malloc calls throughout engine. Reworked parallel queue ticks. Fixed GHitchThresholdCVar. Optimized gameplaytags.

* New: Optimized component movements by avoiding unnecesary virtual OnUpdateTransform calls.

* New: Velocity and Depth passes are now using shaders that do not calculate/export unused interpolators

* Optimize speed tree stuff in FLocalVertexFactory::SetMesh.

#### UI

* Bugfix: Fixed buffer overwrite caused by strcpy ignoring the length argument.

* Added guards to prevent GC running when FLegacySlateFontInfoCache is being used by a non-game thread

* Cut down on allocations coming from text blocks in UMG.

* FCharacterList now returns its FCharacterEntry by value

    * This means that we can't accidentally hold a reference to memory that may become invalid if the array or maps that contain the FCharacterEntry are re-allocated.

* Stopped the Slate texture atlas being updated by the start-up movie thread

    * This could lead to a race-condition when loading your games style-set

##### Slate

* New: Added option "Allow Context Menu" to enable/disable context menu for SEditableText, SEditableTextBox, SMultiLineEditableText, SMultilineEditableTextBox.

    * This is also exposed via UMG and defaults to True.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when deleting a FSlateImageRun that isn't set to use a dynamic brush

* Bugfix: Fixed a memory leak in FSlateBatchData that can occur when a batch has no vertex or index data

* Ensured user interface assets referenced by UUserInterfaceSettings can be considered part of the disregard for gc root set in a cooked game

* Reduced unnecessary memory allocations in various Slate methods

* Removed SLATE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE and SLATE_TEXT_ARGUMENT

* SCheckBox now overrides IsInteractable() and returns true if the widget is enabled and supports keyboard focus.

* When an SToolTip::SetContentWidget is called, the ToolTipContent widget's font should now correctly use the font passed into the constructor.

## Upgrade Notes

### Animation

* **Multi-threaded Animation Optimization**

    * The change to allow more animation work to run in worker threads has required deprecating a lot of API calls in the animation system. The main driver behind this was to control data access more tightly across threads. To this end, much anim-graph-accessed data has been moved from UAnimInstance to a new struct - FAnimInstanceProxy. This proxy structure is where the meat of the data on UAnimInstance is found.

    * Here is an example of how one would build a custom native AnimInstance class using the new proxy, granting Blueprint access to its innards and avoiding copies of shared data between the proxy and the instance:

			USTRUCT()

			struct FExampleAnimInstanceProxy : public FAnimInstanceProxy

			{

				GENERATED_BODY()

				FExampleAnimInstanceProxy()

				: FAnimInstanceProxy()

				{}

				FExampleAnimInstanceProxy(UAnimInstance* Instance);

				virtual void Update(float DeltaSeconds) override

				{

					// Update internal variables

					MovementAngle += 1.0f * DeltaSeconds;

					HorizontalSpeed = FMath::Max(0.0f, HorizontalSpeed - DeltaSeconds);

				}

			public:

				UPROPERTY(Transient, BlueprintReadWrite, EditAnywhere, Category = "Example")

				float MovementAngle;

				UPROPERTY(Transient, BlueprintReadWrite, EditAnywhere, Category = "Example")

				float HorizontalSpeed;

			};

			UCLASS(Transient, Blueprintable)

			class UExampleAnimInstance : public UAnimInstance

			{

				GENERATED_UCLASS_BODY()

			private:

				// The AllowPrivateAccess meta flag will allow this to be exposed to Blueprint,

				// but only to graphs internal to this class.

				UPROPERTY(Transient, BlueprintReadOnly, Category = "Example", meta = (AllowPrivateAccess = "true"))

				FExampleAnimInstanceProxy Proxy;

				virtual FAnimInstanceProxy* CreateAnimInstanceProxy() override

				{

					// override this to just return the proxy on this instance

					return &Proxy;

				}

				virtual void DestroyAnimInstanceProxy(FAnimInstanceProxy* InProxy) override

				{

				}

				friend struct FExampleAnimInstanceProxy;

			};

* The following functions and variables of the **UAnimInstance** class are **now deprecated**:

    * UngroupedActivePlayerArrays, SyncGroupArrays, VertexAnims, MakeSequenceTickRecord, MakeBlendSpaceTickRecord, SequenceAdvanceImmediate, BlendSpaceAdvanceImmediate, CreateUninitializedTickRecord, GetSlotWeight, SlotEvaluatePose, ReinitializeSlotNodes, RegisterSlotNodeWithAnimInstance, UpdateSlotNodeWeight, ClearSlotNodeWeights, UpdateSlotRootMotionWeight, MontageEvaluationData, GetNodeFromIndexUntyped, GetCheckedNodeFromIndexUntyped, GetCheckedNodeFromIndex, GetNodeFromIndex, RootNode, EvaluateAnimation, NativeEvaluateAnimation, RequiredBones, AnimNotifies, GetSyncGroupReadIndex, GetSyncGroupWriteIndex, TickSyncGroupWriteIndex, MorphTargetCurves, MaterialParameterCurves, InitializationCounter, CachedBonesCounter, UpdateCounter, EvaluationCounter, SlotNodeInitializationCounter, bBoneCachesInvalidated, AddAnimNotifies, PassesFiltering, PassesChanceOfTriggering, AddAnimNotifyFromGeneratedClass, UpdateAnimationNode

* Direct anim Blueprint member variable access can be enabled and disabled using "Optimize Anim Blueprint Member Variable Access" in settings.

* Previous Blend In Time and Blend Out Time should recover to BlendIn.BlendTime and BlendOut.BlendTime.

    * This might cause some issue if you modified those nodes.

    * This change can cause animations to be resaved. Please make sure you resave those animations, otherwise, it will cause them to recompress everytime loading.

    * You should see the warning message coming up in the editor

### Automation

* All automation tests now require Context and Filter flags; omission will result in compile failures.

### Blueprints

* Bugfix: Fixed several blueprint nodes that did not properly handle Enum redirectors

* If you would like your Blueprint to execute development-only function calls at runtime in a cooked build, there is a new option in the Project Settings in the "Cooker" section called "Compile Blueprints in Development Mode" that can be toggled on.

    * Note that by default, these functions will no longer execute at runtime in a cooked build, so it will be necessary to enable this option for your project if you would like to continue to see log output from Blueprints in your cooked builds.

* If your game explicitly manages t.MaxFPS and also uses UGameUserSettings, please be aware that UGameUserSettings::ApplySettings will now update t.MaxFPS based on UGameUserSettings::FrameRateLimit

### Core

* You now put the settings in a centralized file, instead of having to place the file in the same content path the asset that has PerObjectConfig settings.

* PostSerialize is now correctly called on DataTables after loading from disk

* t.HitchThreshold (the time in seconds to be considered a hitch) has been renamed to t.HitchFrameTimeThreshold (in miliseconds) to be consistent with other performance target cvars

* The formatting of the "obj list" command has changed; external parsers for .memreport or log files that relied on the old formatting will need to be updated

* Use of IDelegateInstance::GetUObject can be replaced with a GetUObject call directly on the delegate.

    * Use of IDelegateInstance::GetFunctionName can be replaced with a TryGetBoundFunctionName call directly on the delegate in non-shipping builds only.

    * Other uses of IDelegateInstance should be rewritten to not depend on the delegate state.

* Your UCLASSes may stop compiling if you have accidentally relied on a public (or protected) access specifier coming from another class in the same file. Please make sure to explicitly specify the desired access in your class.

### Editor and Tools

* In Construction Scripts, it can be fairly customary to set all the various spline mesh parameters (static mesh, start/end, tangents, roll, up vector, scale) one by one. Electing to only update the static mesh on the final call will provide a worthwhile performance gain.

* See SESSION console command for details.

* Spline Mesh Component now has an extra optional parameter on any Blueprint calls which set the spline mesh parameters in some way, allowing the user to state whether the collision / mesh should be updated afterwards.

    * In Construction Scripts, it can be fairly customary to set all the various spline mesh parameters (static mesh, start/end, tangents, roll, up vector, scale) one by one. Electing to only update the static mesh on the final call will provide a worthwhile performance gain.

* The tab spawners for the widget reflector and atlas visualizers are now registered automatically when the SlateReflector module is loaded. These are now the only way to create these windows.

    * If you were doing this because you were placing it into your own window, you can take advantage of the fact that the widget reflector tab spawner is always available, and use the global tab manager to create your window and place a spawned widget reflector tab inside it - SummonPerfTestSuite in SPerfSuite.cpp provides an example of this.

    * If you were doing this in the handler of your own widget reflector tab spawner, you can either just use the standard widget reflector tab spawner instead (you need to load the SlateReflector module once, and then "WidgetReflector" will be available to spawn via the global tab manager), or you can just use the DisplayWidgetReflector function of ISlateReflectorModule (which will internally do the same thing).

    * To use this feature select multiple targets within the Project Launcher, or from the command line separate each target device with a '+'.

### Gameplay Framework

* If you make use of the OnUpdateTransform virtual on USceneComponent, you now need to makes sure bWantsOnUpdateTransform is set true.

### Localization

* If any localization namespaces contain a comma in their name, existing PO files should be edited so that any msgctxt refering to that namespace prepends a backslash before the comma.

* Translations for dialogue wave spoken text in localization archives should be moved into the root localization namespace from the "Dialogue" localization namespace.

### Networking

* Beacon types are set by their UObject class name rather than specified by developers. This will prevent accidental incompatibility with derived child classes.

    * After specifying the ClientBeaconActorClass in the child class, set the BeaconTypeName equal to ClientBeaconActorClass->GetName() and remove any previous implementation of a "beacon name" from the code.

### Online

* Implement the OnShowDialog and OnDismissAllDialogs events to get callbacks when the browser want to pop up or hide dialogs

* The SWebBrowserView widget can be used as a near drop-in replacement for SWebBrowser in cases where ShowControls, ShowAddressBar and ShowInitialThrobber were set to false. Swap out the class name and remove these options from the construction.

### Other

* Following this change, your Editor and projects will have default values for new privacy settings. To change these, go to the following settings in the Editor:

    * Editor Settings -> Privacy -> Send Usage Data (defaults to True)

    * Project Settings -> End User Settings -> Send Anonymous Usage Data To Epic (defaults to True)

### Physics

* PhysicsThrusterComponent.h is no longer included by default in Engine.h

### Platforms

* Existing profiles should be moved to the new location automatically when UFE launches.

#### Playstation 4

* PS4 has been updated to SDK 3.008.201

* SDK 2.5 is no longer supported. Projects on 4.11 will need to upgrade to SDK 3.0

* More memory can now be given to the GPU heap.

#### Xbox One

* The November 2015 XDK represents a significant change in XDK layout and APIs.

    * Using an XDK version older than November 2015 with this version of the engine will require significant code changes.

    * Manifest generation will not function with the original November 2015 XDK. Please use at least QFE 1 with this release.

### Programming

* The XGE build hang was fixed in an update to the UCRT. It is recommended to install the UCRT update to fix the issue at it's source.

    * This update is available at [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50410](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=50410).

* If you use EMouseCaptureMode::Type directly you'll need to convert them to EMouseCaptureMode.

### Rendering

* Affect the look, content retweak might be needed but the new way provides more control and quality

* Can cause a lot of texture to be recooked

* Fixes minor colorshift on object borders, more visible with large radius, as this changes the look retweaking might be needed

* Look change is possible, might have to change content

* Some texture might look a bit sharper and adjusting the settings could be considered

#### Lighting

* This may show shadow acne from movable lights more in extreme cases.

#### Postprocessing

* Look change might need retweaking of the materials

#### Optimizations

* If you derive from USceneComponent and want the virtual function OnUpdateTransform to be called, you now need to make sure the bWantsOnUpdateTransform flag is enabled. This is true by default, but disabled on some classes (e.g. particle components).

### UI

* The text layout now requires some extra context to handle text shaping. See FSlateTextRun for an example of how these API changes affect how you deal with text within your custom run types.

    * IRun::Measure and IRun::GetKerning now take a FRunTextContext parameter.

    * IRun::CreateBlock now takes a FLayoutBlockTextContext parameter.

#### Slate

* Use SLATE_ATTRIBUTE and SLATE_ARGUMENT with the FText type instead of SLATE_TEXT_ATTRIBUTE and SLATE_TEXT_ARGUMENT

### C++ API Changes

* The DecalSize parameter to SpawnDecalAtLocation() and SpawnDecalAttached() has been changed to be consistent with similar functions and the editor UI. The components are now interpreted as (XYZ) rather than (ZYX). Uses of these functions need to be changed to swap the X and Z components of DecalSize otherwise the decal may appear stretched or not show up at all.

* The shader platform SP_OPENGL_ES2 has been renamed to SP_OPENGL_ES2_ANDROID in the C++ source code to better reflect that it is used only on Android.

* Unnecessary AI navigation-related headers has been removed from Engine.h.  You may need to manually include headers of navigation classes now.

* USCS_Node::ChildNodes is now a private member. Manipulation must be performed via accessor functions.  Direct reference of USCS_Node::ChildNodes is now prohibited. Modify code to use accessor functions exposed in USCS_Node instead.

* Removed debug/show rendering features on shipping I did the first part, lock some showflags to be 0 or 1 in SHIPPING.  Some code might rely on that - consider not using showflags e.g. PostProcessSettings or change the line in ShowFlags.inl

* We now use App Id terminology instead of Client Id.  Replaced all ClientId usage with AppId.

* UActorComponent::OnComponentDestroyed now takes a boolean parameter that indicates whether the entire Actor that owns the component is being destroyed at once or if the component is being destroyed independently.  This can be used to avoid expensive operations like individually detaching scene components for an entire hierarchy that is being destroyed at once.

* Unreal Build Tool: Using the -precompile option with UnrealBuildTool will now build all engine modules. Overriding the GetModulesToPrecompile() function from a game's target rules is no longer necessary, and has been deprecated.

* Refactored automated test flags

    * Added Disabled flag to disable tests without commenting-out or deleting code.

    * Replaced Smoke Test button in Automation Front End with a Filters dropdown.

    * Test configurations do not compile out Automation features (except in Shipping mode).

    * Automation tests can be triggered from in-game console in non-editor builds (automation controller is enabled).

* Srialization: Exposed entire serializer state in backend API.  See the documentation in IStructSerializerBackend and the changes in FJsonStructSerializerBackend and WebJSStructSerializerBackend for details.

* Media: Changed UMediaPlayer.IsStopped to .IsReady.  Change usages of IsStopped() to !IsReady()

* Analytics-related settings changes:

    * Deprecated UEditorSettings::bEditorAnalyticsEnabled in General (advanced) Editor Settings. Use UAnalyticsPrivacySettings::bSendUsageData (see AreEditorAnalyticsEnabled()).

    * Deprecated UEngine::bHardwareSurveyEnabled config value. Use UEndUserSettings::bSendAnonymousUsageDataToEpic (see AreGameAnalyticsEnabled()).

* The ENGINE_VERSION define has been removed, and replaced with references to FEngineVersion::Current(). The BUILT_FROM_CHANGELIST define is still available where required.

* Existing overrides of the virtual OnComponentDestroyed must change their signature to accept the boolean parameter and pass it along to the Super::OnComponentDestroyed.

* Added new RHITransitionResources API for adding explicit GPU barriers for APIs which require them.

* The tabbed layout within the widget reflector has made it impossible to create the widget reflector unless spawned via a tab manager. To this end, the following functions have been removed from ISlateReflectorModule:

    * GetWidgetReflector

    * GetAtlasVisualizer

    * GetTextureAtlasVisualizer

    * GetFontAtlasVisualizer

* New option to reduce the number of render targets updated in the main render pass of opaque materials.

    * It can be enabled by setting "r.SelectiveBasePassOutputs=1" in the engine ini file.

    * This affects the following render targets : custom data, preshadow factors and velocity buffer.

* Because text shaping requires some extra context, there have been some API changes:

    * IRun::Measure and IRun::GetKerning now take a FRunTextContext parameter.

    * IRun::CreateBlock now takes a FLayoutBlockTextContext parameter.

* The TargetRules.GetModulesToPrecompile() has been deprecated. Using the -precompile argument with UnrealBuildTool will now precompile all compatible engine modules.

* ChildActors now inherit their visibility from the owning component and actor visibility

* AActor::ParentComponentActor has been deprecated and made private. Use GetParentComponent() or IsChildActor() to reach the same information.

* Renamed automation test flags to remove ATF_ prefix

    * Split ATF_Game flag into ClientContext and ServerContext flags

    * Removed action option flags.

    * Replaced EAutomationTestType flags with filter flags in EAutomationTestFlags.

* Added ability to automatically generate mip-maps for a RenderTarget2D resource.

* Media: Simplified media event related API

* IMediaPlayer.OnClosed, .OnEndReached, OnOpened, . OnOpenFailed, and .OnTracksChanged have been replaced with .OnMediaEvent that provides a value of the new EMediaEvent enumeration type.

* Most of the keying logic has been moved from individual tracks and sections to a new base class called FKeyframeTrackEditor.

    * Custom FPropertyTrackEditors have a few new abstract methods to implement which are documented in the header.

    * Custom UMovieSceneSections must implement the IKeyframeSection which is documented in it's header.

* Moved AttachmentReplication update out of SceneComponent and to ActorReplication. It only needs to be done on the network authority and only for the root component, and replication updates is a better place to check this.

* AActor::AttachmentReplication is now private. This is filled in via GatherCurrentMovement() when the RootComponent has an AttachParent.

    * This was made private because too many people were trying to update this struct to try to change attachment state, only to have those changes overwritten during replication. It is simply used to replicate attachment state, and attachment should be changed the usual way through the component and actor functions.

    * Added a read-only accessor, GetAttachmentReplication().

* Optimized FCollisionQueryParams::AddIgnoredActor() and AddIgnoredComponents().

* FCollisionQueryParams::IgnoreComponents is now private, use AddIgnoredComponent() and GetIgnoredComponents() instead.

    * This enabled an optimization to make the components list unique only once on-demand in GetIgnoredComponents(), rather each time a component is added.

* Optimization: Inlined ACharacter methods: GetMesh(), GetCharacterMovement(), GetCapsuleComponent(), GetArrowComponent().

* ACharacter members MeshComponent, CharacterMovement, CapsuleComponent, and ArrowComponent are now private. They have been marked with DEPRECATED_FORGAME for a few releases now.

    * Please use the GetMesh(), GetCharacterMovement(), GetCapsuleComponent(), GetArrowComponent() accessors instead.

* Optimized character net location update and mesh interpolation to cause fewer transform updates, especially on the mesh.

    * Added Character::bClientCheckEncroachmentOnNetUpdate to control whether we care about checking for encroachment when we get a new network location.

* Character::UpdateSimulatedPosition() has been deprecated in favor of OnUpdateSimulatedPosition(), and now occurs after SmoothCorrection(). It is no longer responsible for updating the transform.

    * UCharacterMovement::SmoothCorrection() is now responsible for updating the capsule to the new location/rotation.

    * SmoothCorrection() no longer moves the character mesh at all (which is the same net result as before since it used to just undo the rotation change from the server).

* Viewports can now use both pre-multiplied and non-pre-multiplied alpha blending

    * SViewport now has an PreMultipliedAlpha argument (default true), which can control whether to use pre-multiplied alpha when blending is enabled (blending is disabled by default).

    * Note: This is a change in behavior from 4.10, as non-pre-multiplied alpha blending used to be the default.

* FSlateDrawElement API cleanup:

    * FSlateDrawElement::MakeGradient no longer takes a bInGammaCorrect bool, instead pass ESlateDrawEffect::NoGamma as part of InDrawEffects to disable gamma correction.

    * FSlateDrawElement::MakeViewport no longer takes a bInGammaCorrect bool, instead pass ESlateDrawEffect::NoGamma as part of InDrawEffects to disable gamma correction.

    * FSlateDrawElement::MakeViewport no longer takes a bInAllowBlending bool, instead pass ESlateDrawEffect::NoBlending as part of InDrawEffects to disable blending.
