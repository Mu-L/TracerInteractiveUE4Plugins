# 主要機能

## 新規：シーケンサーのライブ録画

シーケンサーに [Siggraph Real-Time Live! 2016](https://www.unrealengine.com/blog/unreal-engine-4-powers-real-time-cinematography-at-siggraph) で紹介したライブ録画の改善点が更新されています。

![image alt text](image_1.jpg)(h:674 w:929 convert:false)

シーケンス レコーダーは、すべてのアニメーション、オーディオ、エフェクトをシーケンサーで編集可能なスタンドアローン アセットにインクルードしながら、ゲームプレイのライブ キャプチャを可能にします。今回のリリースで追加された新機能は以下のとおりです。

* 選択したアクタをすぐに機能し、カメラが記録されている場合はカメラ カットのトラックを自動作成する機能

* 任意のコンポーネントとプロパティを記録するように指定する機能

* データをレベルで所有するアクタへ記録するオプション機能

* アクタが記録されないがアタッチされている場合、ワールド空間へトランスフォームを記憶する機能

## 新規：Movable Light (可動ライト) のシャドウ マップ キャッシュ

移動しないポイント ライトまたはスポット ライトに対して、シャドウ マップを格納して次のフレームに再利用することができます。この機能は自動処理で、背景が通常は動かないゲームでは、シャドウ キャスティング ムーバブル ポイントライトとスポットライトの効率を上げます。

![image alt text](image_2.jpg)(h:541 w:929 convert:false)

上の画像は 33 個の動的シャドウ キャスティング ポイントライトが最小限のオーバーヘッドで表示されています。

970 GTX で 1920x1200 の場合のパフォーマンスは以下の通りです。

* キャッシュなしの 33 個のシャドウ キャスティング ポイント ライト:**シャドウ デプスのレンダリング時間は 14.89ms**

* キャッシュされたシャドウ マップを使用: **.9ms** **(16 倍の速さ！)**

* 33 個のポイント ライトの寄与のレンダリングにあと 2ms 必要であることに留意してください。別の方法でも最適化できますが、この変更は反映されません。

* キャッシュで使用するメモリは ‘Stat ShadowRendering’ で表示されます。このシーンの場合は 25.6 Mb でした。

* キャッシュで使用できる最大メモリは ‘r.Shadow.WholeSceneShadowCacheMb’ で制御できます。

制限事項

* デフォルトでは、以下の場合のみキャッシュされます。

    * プリミティブの可動性が [Static (静的)] または [Stationary (固定)] に設定されている場合 

    * 使用しているマテリアルが World Position Offset を使わない場合

    * ライトの種類がポイントまたはスポットで、シャドウ キャスティングあり、可動性の設定は [Movable] で動いていない場合

* アニメートしているテセレーションまたはピクセル深度オフセットを使用しているマテリアルは、シャドウ深度がキャッシュされるとアーティファクトを生じ得ることがあります。

## 新規：Voronoi (ボロノイ) ノイズ マテリアル

ノイズ マテリアル ノードで利用できる Voronoi ノイズ オプションを追加しました。Voronoi ノイズは Worley または Cellular ノイズとも呼ばれ、プロシージャルなマテリアル生成に便利な場合があります。 

![image alt text](image_3.jpg)(h:333 w:624 convert:false)

Voronoi ノイズは、以下の像で分かるように、大理石などお馴染みの物理マテリアルにパターンを生成するために使用します。

![image alt text](image_4.jpg)(h:377 w:624 convert:false)

この例では、「グラディエント マッピング」という技術と Voronoi ノイズを併用して、大理石のような外見を実現しました。

![image alt text](image_5.jpg)(h:233 w:929 convert:false)

左から右の順に

1) 標準的な Voronoi ノイズ、1 オクターブ

2) "Gradient" ノイズのある Voronoi を入力位置に追加して 0.05 に設定

3) Gradient ノイズに 0.3 を乗算してから Voronoi 入力位置へ追加

4) ランダムなタイリング テクスチャのテクスチャ座標としてステップ 3 の結果を使用

Voronoi ノイズは 4 段階の品質レベルがあります。レベルが高いほどグリッド アーティファクトは減少しますが、シェーディング時間が大幅に増加します。

さらに、いくつかのマテリアル ノード機能でパフォーマンスが改善されました。機能選択ツールチップでパフォーマンスのトレードオフについて詳細を紹介しています。これらはランタイムが遅い場合が多いので、結果をテクスチャへ焼き付けることをお勧めします。

## 新規：レンダー ターゲットへのブループリント描画

ブループリント機能で、レンダリング ターゲットにマテリアルを描画できるようになりました。ゲーム特有の多彩なレンダリング エフェクトを、ソースコードを修正せずに実装することができます。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_6.gif)
[/REGION]

これは、ブループリントとマテリアル グラフに完全に実装した流体サーフェイス シミュレーションです。キャラクターと発射物は水面を押すことができます。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_7.gif)
[/REGION]

これは、発射物の衝撃時の高度値を累積して、ブループリントだけで作成したシンプルな高度フィールド ペインターです。

新機能の **Draw Material to Render Target** は、マテリアルの **Emissive Color** 入力でレンダー ターゲット先を塗りつぶすクワッドを描画します。

![image alt text](image_8.jpg)(h:149 w:661 convert:false)

ゲームを開始すると、**Begin Play** が呼び出され、レンダー ターゲットが青で塗りつぶされます。レンダー ターゲットを右クリックして、圧縮できるように静的テクスチャとして保存します。  

![image alt text](image_9.jpg)(h:164 w:500 convert:false)

レンダー ターゲットをさらに細かく描画する場合は、 **Begin Draw Canvas to Render Target ** と **End Draw Canvas to Render Target** を使用します。これらを使うと、キャンバス オブジェクトフォント描画メソッドだけでなく、レンダー ターゲットの複数のサブセットを効率的に描画することができます。

![image alt text](image_10.jpg)(h:517 w:896 convert:false)

ブループリントからオフスクリーンのレンダリングが可能になったので、グラフィック プログラマーの助けを借りずに多くのレンダリング機能をすぐに実行することができます。ピクセル シェーダー処理で大きいレンダー ターゲットへのたくさんのパスを使って、GPU も保管しやすくなりました。これらの描画コールは、(WorldTick イベント配下の) デバッグ コンソールに 'ProfileGPU' と入力すると表示されます

制限事項

* 指定したマテリアルでテクスチャとしてサンプルにしているレンダー ターゲットへの描画はできません。アルファ ブレンディングを使用してレンダー ターゲットをインプレースで修正する、あるいは異なる 2 つのレンダー ターゲット間を行き来します。

* マテリアルの Emissive Color 出力と Opacity 出力のみ有効です。レンダー ターゲットへ描画する際、ライティングはサポートされず、WorldPosition のようなノードは期待しない値になる場合があります。

* Emissive Color はデフォルトで正の値にクランプされていますが、マテリアル プロパティ ‘AllowNegativeEmissiveColor’ を有効にすれば負の値を出力することができます。

* コンテンツ サンプル プロジェクトの **BlueprintRenderToTarget ** マップで実際の作業の様子を見ることができます！

## 新規：頂点アニメーションの Alembic インポータ (体験版)

Alembic アニメーションのインポート機能がサポートされます！Alembic Importer を使うと複雑なアニメーションをオフラインでオーサリングして、UE4 内でリアルタイムでレンダリングすることができます。この機能はまだ体験版ですが、ぜひ試してみてください。フィードバックをお待ちしています。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_11.gif)
[/REGION]

Alembic キャッシュをいくつかの方法でインポートできます。

* **スタティックメッシュ**.Alembic アニメーションの単一のフレームを Static Mesh アセットとしてインポートします(アニメーションは何も適用されません)。

* **ジオメトリ キャッシュ**新しいタイプのアニメーション アセットで、頂点が変化するシーケンスの再生を可能にします。インポートされた Alembic アニメーションは、フレームのフリップブックとして再生されます。パフォーマンスはメッシュの複雑度に応じて変わるので、最適にならないケースもあります。

* **スケルタルメッシュ**.頂点カウントが変わらない限り、Alembic アニメーションを再生する場合に最も効率が高い方法です。インポート中、アニメーション シーケンスは PCA スキームを使って圧縮されます。共通ポーズ (ベース) が抽出されて、ウェイト付けされて再生中にオリジナルのアニメーションを作成します。パーセンテージ (使用するベースの定数) も定義して、圧縮度を微調整することができます。

## 新規：メッシュのプレビュー シーン

スタティックメッシュとスケルタルメッシュのプレビューに使用するシーンの設定機能が追加されました。 

![image alt text](image_12.jpg)(h:232 w:929 convert:false)

[Preview Scene Settings (プレビュー シーン設定)] パネルがスタティックメッシュ エディタとスケルタルメッシュ エディタに追加されました。ここで、複数のプロファイル (シーン) を設定してメッシュをプレビューすることができ、プロファイルで以下の変更が可能になります。

* 指向性ライト (色、強度、回転)

* スカイライト (HDRI 環境マップ、強度、回転)

* ポストプロセス設定 (ポストプロセス ボリュームと同じ)

![image alt text](image_13.jpg)(h:494 w:766 convert:false)

ショーケース機能も幾つか追加しました。

* 手動で背景 (K キーを長押し) と指向性ライト (L キーを長押し) を手動で回転

* ライティング リグを自動で回転 (指向性ライトと背景)

* フロア (O キー) と背景 (I キー) を簡単に非表示

## 新規：メッシュ デカール

スタティックメッシュの上に効率的にマテリアルを衝撃で平らにして、効果的に異なるマテリアルを互い違いに滑らかに重ねることができる機能です。独自のトポグラフィとマテリアルを使って、下層のジオメトリのプロファイルの上に置かれている 2 つ目のメッシュだと考えてください。 

![image alt text](image_14.jpg)(h:326 w:428 convert:false)

上の画像の柱は、下画像のワイヤーフレームで示したように細かく分割した単一のメッシュで基本メッシュをオーバーレイ表示して作成しました。左側の柱はメッシュ デカールを使うことで、カラー、法線、ラフネスのスムーズなブレンドが可能です。右側の柱は、比較のためにマテリアルをマスクしています。  

![image alt text](image_15.jpg)(h:220 w:165 convert:false)![image alt text](image_16.jpg)(h:220 w:169 convert:false)

ディファード デカールとは違ってプロジェクションが一切含まれていないので、マテリアルにサーフェイス オフセットを含むためには、下層のサーフェイスとしっかり転結した典型的なデカール メッシュが必要な場合があります。メッシュ デカール ジオメトリが LOD メッシュを貫通する LOD がある場合は注意してください。

## 新規：Widget Interaction コンポーネント

Widget Interaction コンポーネントを使って、ワールドでウィジェット コンポーネントでハードウェア入力イベントのシミュレーションが可能になりました。  

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_17.gif)
[/REGION]

ワールドのオブジェクトにレーザーポインタのようにアタッチして、ウィジェットとインタラクトします。ビヘイビアをカスタマイズするオプションは他にもいろいろあります。標準の入力をプレイヤー コントローラーで使う場合には、インタラクション コンポーネントをマウスのアップ / ダウンなどの特定のハードウェア入力をユーザーがその時たまたまカーソルを乗せているウィジェット上でシミュレートするように指示します。

ワールド内でマウスで直接 Widget Component をクリックすることに慣れていたユーザーの場合、そのパスはもうサポートされません。ユーザーはインタラクション コンポーネント(In Mouse Mode) をプレイヤーにアタッチして、プレイヤーが受け取る時に入力をインタラクション コンポーネントに転送する必要があります。

## 新規：VR プロジェクト テンプレート

仮想現実向けに作成した新規プロジェクトテンプレートを、デスクトップとコンソールに追加しました。

[REGION:asyncgif]![image alt text](image_18.gif)(h:380)[/REGION] [REGION:asyncgif]![image alt text](image_19.gif)(h:380)[/REGION]

利用するには、[New Project template] の選択ウィンドウで新規の VR オプションを選びます。

このブループリント プロジェクトには、VR での実行を最高 90 fps まで最適化できる設定があります。様々なコントローラーに対応するため、テンプレートには 2 通りの移動のメソッドが、2 つの Pawn ブループリントに別々に入っています。片方はゲームパッド用、もう片方はモーション コントローラ用です。モーション コントローラを使うと、異なる位置へテレポートしオブジェクトを掴んで投げることができます。今後のアップデートでこのテンプレートの C++ バージョンを予定しています。さらに、モバイル VR テンプレートもその後に続けたいです。

## 新規：モバイルで Custom Post-Process が利用可能

Custom Post-Process マテリアルがモバイル デバイスで利用できるようになりました！これは、モバイル レンダラを使って表示した "TV Static" エフェクトです。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_20.gif)
[/REGION]

* この機能を使うためには、プロジェクト設定で [**Mobile HDR**] オプションを有効にしておく必要があります。

* ブレンド可能な位置 ‘Before Tonemapping’ と ‘After Tonemapping’ を使った PostProcessInput0 (SceneColor) からのフェッチをサポート

* この機能は、HDR レンダリングに「モザイク」モードを必要とする古い Android デバイスでは使えません。

* ピクセル深度情報はまだサポートされていません。

## 新規：モバイルでライティング チャネルが利用可能

ライティング チャネルがモバイル レンダラで利用できるようになりました！これにより、ライトを指定して、好きなオブジェクトだけに効果を与えることができます。シネマティックスでの高度なライティング リグに最適です。

![image alt text](image_21.jpg)(h:224 w:793 convert:false)

* 複数の指向性ライトが様々なチャネルでサポートされます。

* 1 つのプリミティブに影響を与えられる指向性ライトは 1 つのみです。* プリミティブに設定される最初のライティング チャネルが、影響を与える指向性ライトを決定します。

* Stationay (固定) または Movable (可動) の指向性ライト からの CMS シャドウは、一致するライティング チャネルを持つプリミティブ上にのみキャストします。

* 動的ポイントライトはライティング チャネルを完全にサポートします。

## 新規：Mac で Shader Model 5 レンダリングが利用可能

Mac Metal で Shader Model 5 サポートがデフォルトで有効になりました。これにより、アンリアル エンジン 4 で利用できる Mac OS X 10.11.6 の Metal 機能がすべて使用できるようになりました。 

![image alt text](image_22.jpg)(h:521 w:925 convert:false)

* レンダー コマンド ディスパッチを平行して行うために、RHI スレッドと平行移動機能を実装します。

* Metal 演算シェーダーに対するサポートを公開します。

* AMD GPU 上での非同期演算サポートを公開します。

* これまで Mac では利用できなかったハイエンドなレンダリング機能を有効にします。

    * *高品質動的 (別名：自動露光)*

    * *演算シェーダー反射環境は、4.13 では個別の GPU でのみ利用できます。*

    * *ディスタンス フィールド アンビエント オクルージョンは、4.13 では個別の GPU でのみ利用できます。*

    * *ディスタンス フィールド シャドウイングは、4.13 では個別の GPU でのみ利用できます。*

## 新規：物理アニメーション コンポーネント (体験版)

物理モーターでスケルタルメッシュ アニメーションを簡単に操作できる物理アニメーションを追加しました。 

[REGION:asyncgif]![image alt text](image_23.gif)(h:401)[/REGION] [REGION:asyncgif]![image alt text](image_24.gif)(h:401)[/REGION]

このコンポーネントは、PhAT で作成および編集可能な、予め設定された物理アニメーション プロファイルが使えるだけでなく、モーターの強度を直接設定することができます。PhAT の新機能 "**Physical Animation Profiles**" は、特定のアニメーションに対する微調整だけでなく、異なるゲーム コンテキストでキャラクターの物理をカスタマイズするパワフルな手段となります。 

PhAT 内で様々なプロファイルを作成および編集し、ランタイム時にそれらを簡単に変更することができます。物理アニメーションのビヘイビアを劇的に変えることができるブループリントの新機能「Apply Physical Animation Profile」と「Apply Physical Animation Settings」をチェックしてください。

## 新規：プロシージャル メッシュのスライス

Procedural Mesh Component に、ランタイム時にプレーンを使ってプロシージャル メッシュをスライスする新しいユーティリティが加わりました。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_25.gif)
[/REGION]

スライス後、必要であれば「もう半分」に対して 2 つ目のメッシュ コンポーネントを作成して、「キャップ」ジオメトリの追加をサポートします。 

さらに、プロシージャル メッシュはシンプルなコリジョンをサポートするので、物理シミュレーションを有効にすることができます！最後に、スタティックメッシュからプロシージャルメッシュへデータをコピーするユーティリティを追加しました (クック済みのビルドで使うためには、‘Allow CPU Access’ フラグをスタティックメッシュ上に設定する必要があります)。 

## 新規：VR でのメッシュ ペイント

VR エディタを使って、テクスチャとメッシュ頂点上にペイントできるようになりました。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_26.gif)
[/REGION]

これにより、VR に没入しながらモーション コントローラを使ってスタティックメッシュをペイントすることができます。    この機能を使うためには、VR の [Mode] ウィンドウを開いて [Mesh Paint] タブをクリックします。そしてワールドのオブジェクトを選択し、照準を合わせてトリガーを引いてペイントします！コントローラーのトリガーは圧力感受性対応です。ペイントを消去するには [Modifier] ボタンを長押しします。

## 新規：VR でのフォーリッジ ペイント

このリリースで、VR にいる間にモーション コントローラを使ってフォリッジ インスタンスへの色付けが可能になりました。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_27.gif)
[/REGION]

フォーリッジ タイプを選択し、レーザーの照準を合わせ、トリガーを引いてフォリッジをペイントします！フォリッジを消去するには [Modifier] ボタンを長押しします。コントローラーのトリガーは圧力感受性対応です。さらに、フォリッジ エディタが改善されて、投げ縄ツールと選択ツールはまだ利用できませんが、VR の中で使える機能性が増えました。

## 新規：VR でのカラー ピッカー

[Color Picker] ウィンドウが VR で使えるようになりました。レベル内のライトおよび他のアクタの色のプロパティを変更できるようになりました。また、カラー ピッカーを使って VR で頂点ペイントとテクスチャ ペイントの色の選択が可能になりました。 

[REGION:asyncgif]

## 新規：ランドスケープ テセレーションの改善点

ランドスケープでのハードウェア テレレーションが格段に速くなりました！ランドスケープは、最も高い LOD でハードウェア テセレーションのみをレンダリングするようになってので、ランドスケープが 2 つ目の LOD に近づくとフェードアウトします。次に続く LOD のテセレーションは有効になっていません。ランドスケープ テレインで変異に対してテセレーションを有効にすると、パフォーマンスが大幅に改善されます。 

![image alt text](image_40.jpg)(h:429 w:593 convert:false)

テセレーションを有効にして最も高い LOD (白) をレンダリングした場合と、テセレーションなしで LOD (カラー) をレンダリングした場合。

## 新規：アニメーションのポーズ アセット

ポーズ アセットという新しいアニメーションのタイプを追加しました。これには指定されたボーンのポーズ一式が含まれ、頂点の形状をブレンドするのを同じ方法で付加してブレンドすることができます。 

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_41.gif)
[/REGION]

FACS (Facial Action Coding System) または viseme (形素) カーブがポーズを操作する場合にフェイシャル アニメーションをサポートする使い方があります。ただし、このシステムを使って複数のポーズをブレンドしてアニメーションを新規作成することもできます。

現時点では、コンテンツ ブラウザのコンテキスト メニューを使って Anim Sequence から、またはペルソナの [Creat Asset (アセット作成)] メニューからポーズ アセットを作成しています。ポーズ アセットを作成する時、ポーズ名が自動生成されます。その後、手入力でポーズの名前をひとつひとつ変更するか、クリップボードに貼り付けて全部まとめてい一度に変更することができます。 

ポーズは通常のアニメーション カーブで操作されます。アニメーションの中にある限り、カーブを確認することができます。ペルソナでは、ポーズをカーブからプレビューするには、現在の [Preview Pose Asset] を設定する必要があります。 

![image alt text](image_42.jpg)(h:152 w:348 convert:false)

AnimGraph では、Pose Blender ノード (Pose By Name) を使って入力カーブに基づいたポーズを出力することができます。 

![image alt text](image_43.jpg)(h:146 w:422 convert:false)

このシステムをサポートするために付加的なブレンドでスケールを処理する方法を改善しました。今後は、ポーズ アセットとモーフ ターゲットの操作に使われるその他のアセット (サウンドウェーブなど) でもカーブをサポートしたいと思っています。

## 新規：Pose Driver Animation ノード (実験的)

ボーンの移動に基づいたカーブ値 (モーフ ターゲット ウェイトなど) を操作するための Pose Driver ノードを新たに追加しました。 

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_44.gif)
[/REGION]

このノードは RBF (Radial Basis Function) を使ってターゲット ボーンの方向に基づいた値を補間します。PoseAsset を使ってボーンのターゲット ポーズ、およびそれぞれのポーズでの望ましいカーブ値を定義しします。このノードは、ボーンの方向に基づいた補正ブレンド形状を操作するための Pose Space Deformer としても使用できます。

## 新規：Animation ノードの Pose Watching 

ペルソナで Anim graph ノードを「ウォッチ」できるようになりました。 

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_45.gif)
[/REGION]

このノードで、AnimGraph の任意のポイントで動的に生成されているポーズを見ることができます。一度に複数の Pose Watch をアクティブにして様々なポイントのポーズを比較して、現在のポーズでエラーが発生した正確なポイントを見つけることができます。複雑な Animation ブループリントのデバッグに非常に便利です。これまでは、見たいノードを直接ルート ノードに接続してブループリントを再コンパイルしなければ使えませんでした。

## 新規：シーン キャプチャの改善点

シーン キャプチャが改善されました。新しい ‘Blueprint Drawing to Render Targets’ 機能を使えばもっと便利になります！

![image alt text](image_46.jpg)(h:173 w:929 convert:false)

* 正投影がサポートされます。

* **Capture Scene** 関数でブループリントがシーン キャプチャをアップデートすると、**Draw Material to Render Target** を使って次の画像処理が可能となります。

* オパシティをアルファでキャプチャできるようなったので、シーン キャプチャで行った部分的なレンダリングを後から別のシーンに合成することができます。

* 深度をはじめ、キャプチャ関連の様々な GBuffer 属性が利用できます。

* シーン キャプチャへのレンダリング対象を簡単に制御する ‘Hidden Actors’ と ‘Show Only Actors’ 配列が追加されました。

![image alt text](image_47.jpg)(h:312 w:364 convert:false)

メッシュを可視性のある形状で正投影のシーン キャプチャにレンダリングして、 Draw Material To Render Target で画像処理することで、戦場の煙などのゲーム特有のエフェクトを実現できます。

## 新規：屈折シェーダーの改善点

頂点法線を参照とし利用して、各ピクセル法線の頂点法線との差異から屈折オフセットを計算する "Pixel Normal Offset" 屈折モードが追加されました。非物理屈折ですが、フラットな水面での屈折に使用できます。

![image alt text](image_48.jpg)(h:153 w:929 convert:false)

左: 屈折なしのシンプルなシーン

中央：水面に不要なオフセットが継続的に発生するデフォルトの屈折メソッド

右：法線マップの差に基づいて変形するピクセル ノーマル オフセット屈折メソッド

![image alt text](image_49.jpg)(h:78 w:344 convert:false)

## 新規：ライン トレースからのテクスチャ座標

ライン トレースからのテクスチャ座標 (UV) 情報をサポートするためのプロジェクト設定を追加しました。 

![image alt text](image_50.jpg)(h:330 w:297 convert:false)

このオプションは [Project Settings (プロジェクト設定)] -> [Physics (物理)] -> [Optimizations (最適化)] にあります。このオプションを有効にすると、‘Find Collision UV’ 関数を使って Hit Result を受け取り、影響ポイントで任意の UV チャネルに対する UV 情報を検索します。UV 情報のコピーは CPU メモリに格納されるため、この機能を有効にするとその分メモリを使います。

## 新規：スプライン編集の改善点

**ブループリント エディタで Spline コンポーネント デフォルトを編集する**

標準のスプライン ビジュアライザー編集機能を使って、Spline コンポーネント ポイントをブループリント エディタに設定することが可能になります。一度配置されるとインスタンス レベルごとにオーバーライドが可能ですが、ブループリントの新規インスタンスがこれらのデフォルトで作成されます。

![image alt text](image_51.jpg)(h:445 w:929 convert:false)

スプライン ビジュアライザーにて "Reset to Default" コンテキスト アクション使用で、インスタンスはブループリントのデフォルト設定に戻ります。ブループリントのデフォルトに対して行われた変更はすべて、スプライン ポイントがその後編集されていないインスタンスに継承されます。

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_52.gif)
[/REGION]

**スプライン ポイントを詳細パネルの数値で編集する**

これまではスプライン ポイントを正確に配置し、スケール、ロール、タンジェントをそれらに割り当てることができませんでした。これらのプロパティが、選択したスプライン ポイントの詳細パネルに表示されるようになります。

![image alt text](image_53.jpg)(h:190 w:449 convert:false)

**新規のスプライン ポイント プロパティ**

スプライン ポイントが、タンジェントの明確な出入り、および任意の入力キーで定義できるようになります。前者は連続しないスプラインを可能にし、後者はポイント間の補間速度をかなり制御します。   これにより、かなり多様性に富んだスプライン パスが制作できるようになります。

スプライン ビジュアライザーには、Spline コンポーネントの詳細のコンテキスト メニューの中に、タンジェントの出入りがロックされずに別々に編集できるオプションがあります。

![image alt text](image_54.jpg)(h:220 w:190 convert:false)

ポイントごとに任意の入力キーを設定が可能になったので、クローズしたスプラインに対しても Loop Position の入力キーの指定が可能になります。

![image alt text](image_55.jpg)(h:192 w:454 convert:false)

入力キーまたはループ位置の指定がない場合は、デフォルトの開始位置は 0.0 になり、ポイントごとに 1.0 ずつ増えていきます。

**ブループリントのスプライン アップデートの遅延**

ブループリント コンストラクション スクリプトでプロシージャルにスプラインをビルドした方が好ましい場合があります。これまでは、スプライン ポイントで毎回演算することによりスプラインがリビルドされていましたが、最適化の目的で、スプライン ポイント演算の後にスプラインをリビルドすべきか指定できるようになります。Update Spline ノードもちゃんとあります。

![image alt text](image_56.jpg)(h:413 w:918 convert:false)

**コンストラクション スクリプトへの入力スプライン ポイント**

スプライン ビジュアライザーでスプラインを手作業で編集し、その後でブループリント コンストラクション スクリプトを使って仕上げる方が便利が場合があります。すべての編集済みポイントを球体のサーフェスにロックしている、以下のような状態がその例です。

![image alt text](image_57.jpg)(h:456 w:929 convert:false)

使用するには、"Input Spline Points to Construction Script" プロパティにチェックを入れます。

![image alt text](image_58.jpg)(h:196 w:452 convert:false)

## 新規：Sub Animation ブループリント

Animation ブループリントの ‘Sub Anim Instance’ ノードを使って、アニメーション ロジックを共有し、他の Sub Animation ブループリントへの参照が可能になります。このノードを使うと、大きい Animation ブループリントを [移動] と [物理] というように、別々のアセットに分割することもできます。 

![image alt text](image_59.jpg)(h:149 w:644 convert:false)

Sub ブループリントのメンバ変数は、入力ピンとしてノードに表示されます。Sub Animation ブループリントは、外部の Animation ブループリントと同じスケルトンを使用しなければなりません。

## 新規：アニメーション カーブ ビューア

ペルソナから [Skeleton Curve] タブを取り除き、改善された [Animation Curves] タブへその機能を移しました。カーブ名の変更、カーブの削除、カーブ データのプレビューができます。 

![image alt text](image_60.jpg)(h:381 w:622 convert:false)

現在のスケルトンに属しているすべてのカーブ、もしくは現在アクティブなカーブをプレビュー アセットで確認できます。アクティブなカーブだけを確認したい場合は、カーブの種類を指定したフィルタ表示も可能です。デフォルト カーブ名はデフォルトでは「属性」になっているので、アニメーション カーブはすべてデフォルトは属性カーブとなります。ご注意ください。 

カーブ値を修正するには、自動チェックボックス オプションをオフにするか、値を直接入力します。 

## 新規：UMG ウィジェットのスプライト

Paper2D スプライトを UMG とスレート ウィジェット用のブラシ入力として使えるようになります。スプライト シートとして開発された UI アートをユーザーが参照できるようにしただけでなく、描画コールをあまり行えないプラットフォームでより効率の良いウィジェットのレンダリングが可能になります。レンダリング時にべて同じレイヤーを共有しているのであれば、同じテクスチャ アトラスを構成しているスプライトはスレートと一緒にバッチ処理することができます。

![image alt text](image_61.jpg)(h:257 w:460 convert:false)![image alt text](image_62.jpg)(h:258 w:460 convert:false)

## 新規：インスタンス化ステレオ レンダリングをVR 用に最適化する

インスタンス化ステレオ レンダリングを使用するためのベロシティ パスを含め、インスタンス化ステレオ レンダリングが大幅に改善されました。PS4 ではマルチビュー サポートが有効になったので、ISR パス使用でパフォーマンスが著しく改善されました。

## 新規：GPU モーフ ターゲット

プロジェクトが Shader Model 5 レベルのハードウェアの GPU でモーフ ターゲットを計算できるようになります。CPU に負担をかけずにこのような演算の実施が可能になります。

![image alt text](image_63.jpg)(h:194 w:520 convert:false)

## 新規：ランドスケープ シェーダー メモリの最適化

最初にロードされたシェーダーのコンパイル時間の短縮、エディタ イタレーションの改善、メモリ使用とシェーダー キャッシュ サイズの削減により、ランドスケープ マテリアル用にコンパイルするシェーダーの組み合わせ数が大幅に減りました。

## 新規：シャドウの最適化 (モバイル)

Combined Static に最適化が追加され、CSM シャドウ モードが 4.12 に追加されました。このモードでは、Stationary (固定) の指向性生徒が静的オブジェクトから静的シャドウを、動的オブジェクトから CSM シャドウをキャストします。4.13 では、CSM シャドウをキャストする動的オブジェクトのバウンスに基づいて適切なシャドウが自動選択されます。静的と CSM を組み合わせたシャドウを受け取るプリミティブをひとつひとつ手作業でタグ付けする必要がなくなりました。

## 新規：ランドスケープ インポート プラグイン

ランドスケープ ファイル フォーマットに新たなプラグイン API が追加されました。デベロッパーは、様々なハイトマップ / ウェイトマップ ファイル フォーマットのサポートをランドスケープに追加するプラグインの作成が可能になります。現在の raw および png のサポートはこの API に変更されます。特に Png サポートは、新たなランドスケープ ファイル フォーマット プラグインの実装のリファレンスとなります。

## 新規：自動化テスト (Android)

プロジェクト ランチャーで、プロジェクトを複数の Android デバイスに同時にパッケージ化および起動することが可能になります。デバイスごとに起動されて app は USB ケーブル経由でホスト PC へ戻され [Session Fronted] ウィンドウで表示されます。

その後で、すべてのデバイス上で自動化テストを起動し、[Session Fronted] ウィンドウ で結果を確認します。

![image alt text](image_64.jpg)(h:542 w:838 convert:false)

## 新規：OpenGL ES 3.1 (Android)

UE4 は長い間 Android の OpenGL ES 3.0 と 3.1 機能の多くをサポートしていますが、Android で ES 3.1 だけをターゲットにできるようになります。これにより、Metal と Vulkan の機能パリティがハイエンドな Android デバイスに提供され、ユニフォーム バッファを使用することで 16 テクスチャ サンプラーを利用できるだけでなく、パフォーマンスも改善されます。

同じプロジェクトに ES 2.0 と ES 3.1 の両方のシェーダーのパッケージ化も選択可能になり、デバイスは性能に応じて最も良いシェーダー プラットフォームを選択します。 

![image alt text](image_65.jpg)(h:220 w:582 convert:false)

## 新規：モバイル パッケージング ウィザード 

コンテンツなしの最小限の app を App Store にアップロードし、残りのコンテンツを Cloud からダウンロードするモバイル用のパッケージ化をサポートする、モバイル パッケージング ウィザードを追加しました。

![image alt text](image_66.jpg)(h:484 w:800 convert:false)

* これは、定期的に DLS アップデートのある大規模なゲームで一般的なパッケージング方法です。

* さらに、ユーザーは、デバイスに必要なテクスチャやシェーダー フォーマットなど、自分のデバイスに必要なコンテンツだけどピンポイントでダウンロードできます。

* ウィザードは、[Project Launcher (プロジェクト ランチャー)] ウィンドウで、プロファイルの新規作成オプションとして利用できます。

## 新規：最大精度のマテリアル (Mobile)

マテリアルをモバイル デバイスで使用する場合、ピクセル シェーダーで最大精度を使用するオプションがつきました。例えば、マテリアルが演算処理でワールド座標を使う場合に役立ちます。

![image alt text](image_67.jpg)(h:92 w:260 convert:false)

## 新規：バイナリ シェーダー キャッシュ (Android)

コンパイルされたシェーダーは最初の使用でディスク上に格納され、次のアプリケーションの実行で再利用されます。 

* GL_OES_get_program_binary 拡張が必要です。 

* デフォルトでは無効です。Android デバイス上でのみ有効にできます (r.UseProgramBinaryCache=1)。

## 新規：ローカライズされたテキスト フォーマットの改善点

ローカライズされたテキスト フォーマットを改善して、より正確な翻訳ができるようになりました。

**複数形**:

* 複数形に対応し、テキスト フォーマットで使用する数値変数に合わせてテキストを使えるようになります。* 複数形には “There is 1 cat”、“There are 4 cats” などの基数、そして “You came 1st!”、“You came 2nd!” などの序数があります。

* 複数形は key->value pairs として指定します。以下のキーワードはすべてサポートされます ([CLDR data]CLDR data でカルチャーに対して定義されている): zero、one、two、few、many など。* 値には、それ自体にもフォーマット マーカーを含む文字列を引用することもできます。

* 基数フォーマットの例："There {NumCats}|plural(one=is,other=are) {NumCats} {NumCats}|plural(one=cat,other=cats)"

* 序数フォーマットの例:"You came {Place}{Place}|ordinal(one=st,two=nd,few=rd,other=th)!"

**ジェンダー フォーム:**

* ジェンダー フォームにより、テキスト フォーマット中の ETextGender 値に応じたテキストが使えるようになります。例) "Le guerrier est fort"、“La guerrière est forte”

* ジェンダー フォームは、男性、女性、中性 (中性はオプション) の順序の値で指定されます。* 値には、それ自体にもフォーマット マーカーを含む文字列を引用することもできます。

* フォーマットの例: "{Gender}|gender(Le,La) {Gender}|gender(guerrier,guerrière) est {Gender}|gender(fort,forte)"

**ハングル文字の助詞:**

* ハングルの助詞により韓国語の文法が分かりやすくなり、終わりが子音か母音かに応じて正しいグリフが挿入されます。例) "사람은"、“사자는”

* ハングルの助詞は、子音、母音の順序の値で指定されます。値は文字列を引用することも可能です。

* フォーマットの例： "{Arg}|hpp(은,는)"

複数形 / ジェンダー形の対応に必要な数値 / ジェンダー値をパスするために、関数の FText::Format(...) ファミリーのすべてが FText ではなく FFormatArgumentValue として値を受け取るようになりました。すべての numeric 型、ETextGender、あるいは ETextGender からでも作成することができます。

これらの value 型をブループリントに設定する機能が、"Format Text" ノードのワイルドカード ピンで表示されます。

![image alt text](image_68.jpg)(h:166 w:564 convert:false)

![image alt text](image_69.jpg)(h:168 w:820 convert:false)

FText::Format(...) への複数のコールに再利用する場合は、フォーマット パターンのプリコンパイルも可能です。FTextFormat インスタンスを作成および格納し、FText::Format(...) へパターンとしてパスします。

## 新規：マルチスレッド オーディオ (実験的)

エディタ外で、サウンド キュー評価とアクティブな WAVE インスタンスの決定をゲーム スレッドごとに行えるようになります。アクティブ サウンド キューの量と複雑度によって結果はゲームごとに異なりますが、初期テスティングの段階で、ゲームスレッドとオーディオスレッド上で 1 フレームにつき約 1ms の変化が確認できたケースもあります。  

この機能は 4.13 ではデフォルトで無効になっていますが、BaseEngine.ini. の [Audio] セクションで **[UseAudioThread]** を **[true]** に変更できます。お試しください。

## 新規：ネットワーク リプレイの後方互換性

リプレイ記録機能で後方互換性がサポートされます。つまり、レプリケートされたプロパティをビルト、追加、削除するための変更をしてから、古いビルドで記録した新しいビルド上にリプレイをロードすることができます。 

この機能をテストするには、任意のビルドでリプレイを記録して、レプリケートしたプロパティを変更してから、新しいビルドに同じリプレイをロードするだけです！

ほとんどの場合、レプリケートされたそれぞれのプロパティの低レベルのリフレクション情報で処理されます。カスタム仕様のシリアル化ネットワーク データ (UObject::NetSerialize) の場合、 ストリームの現在のネットワーク版の取得と古いデータの手作業での処理を可能にする FArchive (FArchive::EngineNetVer() and FArchive::GameNetVer()) に追加した 2 つの新規関数を使うことができます。

## 新規：Build Graph スクリプト (実験的)

BuildGraph スクリプトを使って、ビルド自動化のための UE4 ビルド コマンドのカスタム シーケンスを作成することができます。グラフは MSBuild、ANT、NAnt のようなシンタックスを使った XML スクリプトで宣言され、*タスク* から成る従属 *ノード* のネットワークで構成されます。 

![image alt text](image_70.jpg)(h:382 w:677 convert:false)

Engine/Build/Graph/Examples/…で BuildGraph のサンプルをご覧いただけます。

## 新規：Installed Builds 作成用スクリプト

インストール済みの UE4 を配布するため、プロセスをもっとシンプルに、他の開発チームにより分かりやすくするためにエンジンをカスタマイズして、ビルド プロセスを BuildGraph スクリプト処理言語で書き直しました。スクリプトは Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml にあります。以下のコマンドラインのいずれかを使って AutomationTool を呼び出して実行します。

**Windows:**

BuildGraph -target="Make Installed Build Win64” -script=Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml -clean

**Mac:**

BuildGraph -target="Make Installed Build Mac” -script=Engine/Build/InstalledEngineBuild.xml -clean

このビルド プロセスのカスタマイズに使えるオプション リスト (ビルドされるノートのリストも併せて) をご覧になりたい場合は、 -listonly を付けます。

## 新規：アンリアル プロパティ TSets

TSets が自動シリアル化、ガーベジコレクション、ini 設定、詳細パネルでの編集 (例： "(1,2,3)") の入力に限定) 目的の UPROPERTY として使用できるようになります。TMap と同様に、TSet プロパティはレプリケート メンバとしては使えませんし、ブループリント内でも使用できません。

# リリース ノート 「訳注： 以下は、非常に技術的な部分が含まれるため、翻訳を省略します。」

    * Renamed the Animation Name setting to Override Animation Name.

    * Option to add suffix for importing material curves by name.By default _mat.

*  New:Animation sequences can now be marked as only being required by dedicated servers when they have root motion.

    * Animation sequences still need to be flagged in the project cooker settings as being stripped on servers for this to have any effect.

* New:Pose Asset supports runtime Retargeting option in Skeleton for Animation, Animation Scaled, and Skeletal.

* New:Retarget Window:

    * Automap button automatically attempts to map source skeleton to target skeleton.

    * This doesn't work well with fingers, so you'll have to make sure to set them correctly.

* New:Updated retargeting Animation Blueprints to a new skeleton so that it now finds all references to animations (in native properties and blueprint variables) and not just on animation nodes.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when opening a skeleton when its assigned preview mesh doesn’t use that skeleton.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when a Skeletal Mesh component gets destroyed while triggering a notify.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when adding a section to a zero length montage. 

    * Fixed a nullptr dereference in the montage handling code and disabled the menu option to add section when zero length.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when viewing an uncompressed animation.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when debug drawing of some animation nodes while in PIE. 

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when using undo/redo while editing the Animation Blueprints defaults.

* Bugfix:There was an edge case in random sequence player where there might be an extra loop when waiting on a blend to finish.This made it impossible for a shuffle list to start with the animation that is currently playing, seemingly duplicating the animation.

* Bugfix:Prevented an animation from restarting each time a new section is selected/inspected in the montage editor. 

* Bugfix:Updated animation initialization to now verify the mesh’s hierarchy matches with the skeleton.

* Bugfix:Animation Retargeting:

    * Fixed an issue with Additive Blend Space/Anim Offset.

* Bugfix:Fixed Blend Spaces to no longer produce bad data when degenerate spaces are present.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with animation compression caused by an uninitialized box variable.  

* Bugfix:Fixed Cached Posed Weighting to now ensure that the cached poses update with the highest weight they have been updated with, instead of just the first weight in their Animation Blueprints. 

* Bugfix:Fixed Custom Blend graphs to no longer ignore curve values.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with saving recompressed animations that would cause the error Graph Linked External Object.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue when creating animations with additive curves that would apply the layer twice.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where animation metadata was not being saved for the montage.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with the Layered Bone Blend calling Update on branches with the wrong weight.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where properties that were fed to a Skeletal Mesh component via the construction script were not being updated when edited.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where assets were missed in Montage nodes due to the reference gathering for animation assets in an animation graph not searching the Ubergraph.

    * An issue has been fixed where static meshes with imported LODs would not have the lower LODs' override colors set when "Copy instance vertex colors to source mesh" was used.

    * Various crashes when using mesh paint mode have been fixed, e.g. when selecting a previously selected mesh, when deleting an asset which has an instance currently selected.

* Improved MemoryAnalyser2:

    * Upgraded to Visual Studio 2015.

    * This fixes a bug in the curve editor where undo re-selects and auto-frames.

* For legacy, properties with the CPF_Interp flag can be animated in Matinee.It does not require the CPF_Edit flag as well.This makes Sequencer consistent with Matinee.

* Optimized adding keys to rich curves to improve performance when recording data with the sequence recorder.

    * Set the times and values at once as an ordered set.

* Removed curve editor visibility as a toggleable config.

    * It is now just a toggleable state that defaults to false.

    * If turned off, camera anims will use the camera's current FOV as the initial FOV for the animation.

* New:Added "Is Valid" Blueprint-exposed method for Gameplay Attribute.

* New:Added max depenetration distance settings for the Character Movement Component.Added controls to throttle logging when character is stuck in geometry so it doesn't spam the log.

    * Depenetration settings are separated based on whether overlapping a Pawn versus other geometry, and furthermore by whether the Character is a proxy or not.Simulated proxies typically should not depenetrate a large amount because that effectively ignores the server authoritative location update.

    * "Stuck" logging is controlled by the console var "p.CharacterStuckWarningPeriod".Set to number of seconds between logged events, or less than zero to disable logging.

* New:Added new "Load Level Instance" Blueprint node, which allows to create multiple transformed instances of a .umap without having to include in persistent level's list. 

* New:Added new Blueprint library math/vector functions:"Find Closest Point On Segment", “Find Closest Point On Line”, “Get Point Distance To Segment”, and “Get Point Distance To Line”.

* New:Exposed "Override With" and “Copy Properties” in Player State to Blueprint Children.

* New:Made minimum quadtree size configurable in the Procedural Foliage Spawner.

* New:Added "Is Player Controller" function to Controller.The variable already existed, but wasn’t exposed.

* New:Added check to Post Actor Construction to avoid a Begin Play call on an Actor that is Pending Kill.

* New:Anim Root Motion was applying too much velocity to Character Movement when framerate is low causing moves to be substepped, or when movement mode changes during root motion playback.

    * Added "Anim Root Motion Velocity" to the Character Movement Component to track last velocity extracted from anim root motion.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when cancelling PIE while in the middle of a seamless travel as a client.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash in Game Session if the GameMode’s Player State Class has become null.

* Bugfix:Updated Character movement to make sure the Last Update Location, Rotation, and Velocity are updated on client and server error corrections.The Force Position Update function calls Perform Movement regardless of velocity (there may be root motion or gravity effects).

* Bugfix:Updated comments on "Load Game From Slot" and “Delete Game in Slot”.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where Mesh smoothing on clients was causing a popping briefly when crouching. 

    * This was due to a change in 4.12 where we started smoothing from Z location rather than always zeroing it (in certain movement modes).

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where the Root Motion network connections were not clearing the Root Motion Data, which would cause clients to jitter.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where it was not possible to stream in a sub-level whose name is a substring of another sub-level.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where an Instanced Static Mesh Component would not keep its instances when copy-pasting in the Editor.

* Bugfix:Updated the "Hidden In Game" checkbox to now be properly displayed when editing Scene Component properties.

* Updated HUD so that Show HUD is no longer a config variable, but can be edited from a Blueprint.

* Improved "Move Component To Rotation".

* Added minor performance improvements in Player Input and Input Component by inlining and avoiding memory allocations.

* Updated numerous HUD properties to make them readable, and most of them also writable, from Blueprints.

* Updated Components so they can no longer be added during world tear down.

* Improved character movement linear smoothing in the presence of low net frequency updates.

* Improved comment about the Blocking Hit property in Find Floor Result, explaining it is a valid blocking hit that was not in penetration.Other conditions can be determined from the Hit Result itself.

* Made up/down behaviour for console history consistent and reverted to old ordering by default

* Moved Uninitialize Components outside (Actor Initialized) to always uninitialize components when actors gets destroyed early.

* Updated multi-arg console commands to now accept string commands with or without quotes.

* Optimized NaN and Infinite checks for FVector, FQuat, FRotator, FMatrix, FTransform.SIMD version "Vector Contains NaN Or Infinite" function also optimized on relevant platforms.Added startup tests for “Vector Contains NaN Or Infinite”.

    * All our "Contains NaN" tests are in fact "Is NaN or Is Infinite", which is the same as "not Is Finite", so exploited this to simplify the tests.Both NaN and +/-Inf are not finite (http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/isfinite).In the future we should rename "Contains NaN".

### Learning Resources

#### Content Examples

* New:Added TP_VirtualRealityBP to list of Blueprint templates

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where game targets were not being able to depend on other game targets in the Localization Dashboard.

* Bugfix:Fixed Issues with gathering text from Blueprint Byte code. 

    * Bytecode in Blueprints is very volatile, and can only be safely gathered after it's been compiled (which is not guaranteed to have happened by the time we save the package).This change avoids caching any assets that contain scripts (non-data-only Blueprints), and instead will always load them to perform a gather (which will ensure the Blueprint bytecode is up-to-date due to compile-on-load).

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with Unicode string handling in the web browser widget’s Execute Javascript method.

* Updated Localization compilation to now specify an Archive Name to use.

* Made sure that en-US-POSIX is in our list of available cultures.

* New:Created a batch file, ExtractAllArchives.bat, which can pull down Oodle captures stored in Amazon S3.

* New:Created a batch file, BuildDictionary_Generic.bat, that can generate an oodle dictionary from capture files in an arbitrary location.

* New:Low level network code will now notify the game of two new error types to be handled (Net Guid Mismatch or Net Checksum Failures).This kind of errors occur when there are incompatibilities in between client and server, usually because different cooked data is involved.This shouldn't occur in properly shipped builds but is good during development when the possibility to mix and match builds might happen on accident.

* New:Made some Oodle trainer commandlet improvements:

    * Added a command line parameter to many Oodle trainer commandlet tasks for a changelist number to only process capture files from a specific changelist.

    * When processing Oodle capture files, the Oodle trainer commandlet will now also look recursively in subdirectories.

    * Refactored how the Oodle trainer commandlet processes capture files to make it easier to add new command line options for different tasks.

* New:Added some miscellaneous seamless travel cleanup + sanity checks.

    * Cleanup the naming of variables and logic used to pick which actors will transfer to new world during seamless travel to more explicitly convey intent.

    * Warn when there is no context for a world when destroying actors.It's likely that this world is the floating world during seamless travel, and if we hit this case, something is likely in a bad state

* New:Updated Oodle packet capture file names to now contain the branch name, the changelist of the build, and process ID used to generate the capture.

* New:The console variable "demo.AsyncLoadWorld" can now be overridden with the URL option "Async Load World Override" when playing a replay.

    * When this setting is true, the engine will use seamless travel to load the replay map instead of using the default non-seamless travel method.

* New:The stat for the number of network actors (STAT_NumNetActors) is now tracked on both the server and client.

* New:Updated Oodle compatibility to version 2.1.5.

* New:When properties are incompatible in replays, they will now be shown in the log.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash that could occur when using "open" command in a PIE window.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash that would occur when opening a project from a network drive.

* Bugfix:Fixed assert in channel cleanup code that could occur if the connection was cleaned up, and there were "Keep Processing Actor Channel Bunches Map" in-flight still.

* Bugfix:Fixed incorrect warning when Received Bunch fails for replays.

* Bugfix:Fixed a memory leak when recording a replay on a client that was built using a client-only executable configuration.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue causing improper http header parsing when one or more of the headers are empty.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue that could cause character movement to be saved incorrectly in replays.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue that could cause the spectator controller for a client-recorded replay to incorrectly report that it was local controller during recording.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue that was causing RPCs to be missing from replays that were recorded on clients.

* Bugfix:Fixed several issues and playback artifacts with character positions in replays.

* Deprecated the  "Engine Net Version", “Engine Min Net Version”, and “Engine Negotiation Version” (use the Network Version struct instead).

* Disabled the ability to use hot-reload while PIE windows are open.

* Added extra logging in the form of "UPendingNetGame::InitNetDriver:Sending hello:127.0.0.1" to help diagnose connection issues.

* Highly optimized replay checkpoint recording to take about 50% less time.

* Improved playback quality of character movement for replays that are recorded on a client.

* Keeping track of the number of actors stat (STAT_NumActors) is now more efficient.

* Improved 'Too many calls to RPC' log message informativeness.

* Removed unused "In Bunch" constructor.

* The Oodle trainer commandlet will now only process capture files that end with the .ucap file extension.

### Online

* New:Added PS+ check to account privilege check.

* New:Move Curl and PS4 HTTP request processing to a separate thread.HTTP manager will now start and tick HTTP requests on its own thread, removing the processing from the game thread.Hitches in HTTP requests no longer impact the game thread, and HTTP requests can be ticked more frequently by adjusting [HTTP] Http Thread Tick Rate in .ini config files.

* New:Online Subsystem modules have been moved to Plugins, out of Engine/Source.Engine's dependency on OnlineSubsystem modules have been removed, in some places replaced with a new interface UOnlineEngineInterface for a small subset of features Engine requires.UOnlineEngineInterface is implemented in UOnlineEngineInterfaceImpl.FUniqueNetId and FUniqueNetIdWrapper have been promoted to a basic type in core, but they are still opaque types and must be created by online subsystems.

* New:Added -port command line option for the Steam Online Subsystem.

* Bugfix:Fixed a rare bug in the Build Patch Tool that would cause a manifest to not contain a chunk's information.

* Bugfix:Fixed shutdown crash in HTTP request completion delegate.

* The "Cancel Find Sessions" function in Online Session did not null out search result for LAN results.Future Find Session calls would fail with "search in progress".

### Other

* New:The Metal shader compiler will now retain the text shader code when "r.Shaders.KeepDebugInfo" is enabled to allow for easier debugging.

    * For Mac, shaders are still compiled to bytecode and the Mac runtime will load the bytecode, while debug tools will load the text shader from the system temporary directory.

    * On iOS & tvOS the runtime will load the text shaders so that they appear in the debug tools.

* New:Added validation code to Metal RHI to ensure that we do not erroneously re-clear existing render contents when restoring the render command encoder to continue rendering.

    * This will only be active when the Metal debug layer is enabled and is completely compiled away in Test & Shipping builds for performance.

* Bugfix:Crash fix when loading an empty sub-level on iOS projects using Metal by adding validation of resource bindings.

    * Setting "rhi.Metal.RuntimeDebugLevel" to 1 or greater enables the resource binding validation.

* Bugfix:Crash fixes for various GPU crashes when using Metal by explicitly zero-initialising variables and bounds-checking buffer access in Metal shaders.

    * Added a shader compile option "r.Shaders.ZeroInitialise" that turns on explicit zero-initialisation of local and temporary variables in hlslcc for Metal

    * Added a shader compile option "r.Shaders.BoundsChecking" flag to control whether shader platforms should manually enforce buffer access bounds - HLSL returns zero or ignores invalid reads & writes but Metal leaves the behaviour undefined and some drivers then fail.

* Bugfix:Playback of movies on Mac/iOS that had spaces in the filename.

* Bugfix:Fixed a buffer overflow bug in Detour Tile Cache Builder when removing a vertex that could corrupt the heap on Mac.

* Bugfix:Fixed a compilation error found by the newer version of clang in Xcode 8.

* Bugfix:Fixed rendering of Atmospheric Fog on Metal without affecting other platforms with a minor change to the shader and by using the precise Metal intrinsics for floating point operations.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with Screenshot and movie capture of gameplay on Mac when using Metal to render by inserting an intermediate render-target between the game and the back-buffer.

* Bugfix:Fixed shader compilation for Mac when Apple's 'metal' shader compiler is unavailable by compiling Metal shaders as text instead.

* Bugfix:Fixed the command-line script used to get the number of parallel tasks to use when invoking builds with distcc from Unreal Frontend.

* Bugfix:Fixed the tiled reflections pass on Nvidia GPUs using Metal by removing Max & Min LOD overrides from our calls to "set Sampler State" and “set Sampler States”.

* Flush writable file handles on close on Apple platforms to ensure that they reach the disk prior to program termination.

* Increased the number of input buses for Core Audio 3D Mixer to support 64 audio channels. 

    * Also, added a warning to Start Sources in Audio Device so it doesn't silently ignore sound source initialization failures.

* Reduced memory use in the Mac Editor when running on the Metal graphics API by caching a fallback depth-stencil surface used for canvas tile rendering.

* Reduced the number of temporary memory allocations required to set uniform parameters in Metal.

* Separated texture & buffer references during Metal shader compilation to ensure that buffers don't get assigned an inaccessible index.

* When archiving on for Mac, delete the dest icon if it exists before trying to call File.Move

* Change the Metal buffer pool used inside Metal RHI to better match Apple's internal memory management behaviour to avoid hidden performance problems.

* Disabled "r.DFShadowScatterTileCulling" as well as “r.AOScatterTileCulling” on Mac because we don't have the necessary RW textures on Metal in Mac OS X El Capitan.

* Disabled the Shader Cache by default on Mac to match other platforms as it was not designed to support the new RHI Thread & Parallel Execution features of Unreal Engine 4.

* Disambiguated Metal command-buffer failures by GPU vendor and error type and made failure fatal to avoid cases where attempting to continue causes a kernel panic.

* Enable global clip-plane support for Metal shader platforms.This enables support for Planar Reflection Actors.

* Moved the Xbox One platform settings into the default INI files so they are available to the PC tools and settable in the editor.

* Removed CPU/GPU sync when updating/unlocking textures.

* Deferred deletion of Xbox One D3D resources moved to happen once per real frame as there were circumstances in which it could be called more than once (rendering cube map faces, etc).As a result the latency of deletion has been reduced to two frames, saving memory.

* Dynamic vertex/index buffers use less memory when locking/unlocking.This is also a performance improvement in some cases.

* Improved processing of system events during load. 

    * This will allow a game to suspend earlier in the loading process.

* Large memory savings when locking/updating textures as we now only allocate a linear copy of the mip/array slice that is being locked, rather than the entire texture.

* Occlusion queries now use 8x less memory than in 4.12 by packing 8 queries into each 256 byte allocation.

* Optimized many calls in the Xbox One D3D11 state cache.

* Shaders now use less memory, as intermediate DXBC bytecode has been stripped away in all possible cases.

* New:Added support to be able to set a Canvas Render Target 2D NOT to clear to green whenever it's updated (so you can just draw pixels that have changed instead of always having to redraw everything).

* New:Capsule shadows are now supported in stereo (VR).

* New:Create Project Settings to optionally disable certain rendering features which cause extra shader permutations and extra shader compile time if they are not required for a given project.

    * Can be found under Project Settings > Rendering Overrides (Local). 

    * If an attempt to use a disabled feature is made, a warning will be displayed.

* New:For use when doing automated screenshot verification, the new console command "r.ResetViewState" will reset some state (e.g. Temporal AA index).This allows for more deterministic tests.

* New:Added a new Blueprint function "Clear Render Target 2D", which is the only way to set a render target alpha directly.

* New:Added a new Blueprint function "Create Render Target 2D", which allows self-contained render-to-texture blueprints

* New:OpenGL4 now supports 32 combined samplers.

* New:Stationary Mobility for primitive components is allowed again, with the meaning 'moves rarely'. 

    * Used for caching optimizations (cached shadowmaps).

* Bugfix:Fixed a resource leak with decal rendering in D3D11 RHI.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where bounds were too large due to Scene Component sprites in Editor Builds. 

* Bugfix:Fixed issues with Scene Capture components.

    * Scene cube captures were not updating, leaving the render target unchanged.

    * Scene capture components set to "Capture Every Frame" were only capturing every second frame.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where translucency was appearing in Stationary Light Overlap viewmode. 

* Bugfix:Fixed a Mesh Merge issue with merging mix of different extra bone influence with multiple sections.

* Refactoring of resident mip calculations:

    * Cooker takes into account the same compression block thresholds that the runtime previously used.

    * Runtime doesn't attempt to calculate which mips to perma-load, but just looks at the ones whose bulk data is flagged as end-of-file or separate-file.

* Removed "Update Actor Position".

    * This was not needed in a vast majority of use cases and was causing a crash due to multithreading issues during end of frame updates.

* Removed vertex density viewmode.

* Shader compilation errors will now print the details of the error to the log by default.

* Shader compiler does a recreate render state even during blocking compile.

    * This fixes saving a material giving different behavior from applying changes with global distance fields.

* Improved usability for DBuffer Decals.

    * 'Show Decals' works correctly, previously would fetch from uninitialized textures.

    * DBuffer being enabled forces a full prepass, previously decals would render incorrectly unless correct settings of "r.EarlyZPass" were used.

    * Materials using DBuffer blend modes will fail to compile when the DBuffer project setting is disabled, instead of just being invisible.

* Minor optimization of the Translucency lighting volume clear by moving it to Async Compute.

* Noise material node functions have been renamed to more accurately represent what they do, and all now have tooltips with performance and quality information.

* Renamed some cvars for consistency: 

    * "r.SkinCacheShaders" -> “r.SkinCache.CompileShaders”

    * "r.SkinCaching" -> “r.SkinCache.Mode”

    * "r.MaxGPUSkinCacheElementsPerFrame" -> “r.SkinCache.MaxGPUElementsPerFrame”

* Shader compile error logs are now unsuppressed - shows the cause for materials that fail to compile in cooks.

#### FX

* New:Added "Opacity Source Mode" to Sub UV Animation, which is useful with textures created for additive particles.

* New:Added Particle Light Quality scalability setting since lower-end machines have trouble with particle lights. 

    * They are disabled on low and medium spec machines.HQ lights are only allowed on high-end machines.

* New:Beam emitters can now use particles as their source and target methods.

* New:GPU particle simulation can be separately frozen/unfrozen with "r.GPUParticle.Simulate".

* New:Particle emitters using vector fields can now be configured to use fix DT or variable DT for simulation.

    * Other emitters only use variable DT.

    * Fix DT allows for a more consistent particle behavior when running at different game speed (like slomo) and at different frame rates.

* New:The transforms of individual mesh particles are now available in materials via the "Transform Vector" and “Transform Position” nodes for advanced material effects on mesh particles.

* New:Quality level spawn rate scaling now works on GPU emitters.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash with a Sub UV Animation asset when texture source is cleared.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash that could happen on mesh import if the mesh is used on a currently active particle emitter.

* Bugfix:Fixed several issues with Particle Ribbons using sequential particle selection.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue preventing inherit rotation from working with mesh particles.

* Increased size of texture for curves on GPU particles.

    * This prevents bugs when many GPU particle systems using curves are active.

* Particle Collisions can be ignored for systems not currently in view.

    * Added a console variable to control how long these systems must be inactive for to have their collisions ignored.

    * "fx.ParticleCollisionIgnoreInvisibleTime"

* Reduced tunneling/missed collisions with depth buffer collision.

#### Lighting

* New:Added "r.Shadow.ForceSingleSampleShadowingFromStationary" for scalability.

* New:Added a per-object shadow setting for directional lights

    * "r.Shadow.PerObjectDirectionalDepthBias" - which allows us to set a depth bias for per-object shadows independently of the CSM shadows.

* New:Added cvar "r.Fog" for scalability.

* New:Added "Lower Hemisphere Solid Color" to sky lights.

* New:Added "r.AOSpecularOcclusionMode", which determines how specular should be occluded by DFAO.

    * 0:Apply non-directional AO to specular.

    * 1: (default) Intersect the reflection cone with the unoccluded cone produced by DFAO.This gives more accurate occlusion than 0, but can bring out DFAO sampling artifacts.

* New:Fading out planar reflections based on roughness since they don't have support for variable roughness (fade starts at .2 roughness, ends at .3)

* New:Lights now have their own "Max Draw Distance" setting, along with a fade range to smoothly fade the light out. 

    * Brightness will approach 0 at max draw distance and fade to 100% within the specified fade range.

* New:Planar Reflection Improvements

    * Added "Render Scene Two Sided" to planar reflections, which can be useful to limit leaking.

    * Added "Show Only Actors" and “Hidden Actors” to Scene Capture Component for easy use without having to call BP functions.

    * Added "Show Preview Plane" to Planar Reflection actors

    * The view state is recreated on planar reflection edit, which resets the Temporal AA history, allowing instant previewing of changes

* New:Scaled sphere intersection for indirect capsule shadows.

    * Fixes the discontinuity when capsule axis points close to the light direction.

* New:Skylight occlusion tint now applies to specular.

    * Skylight occlusion tint on diffuse is now correctly affected by Diffuse Color.

* New:Spreading precomputed visibility to neighbors now uses a 2D grid to find neighbors.

    * This speeds up the process for 800k cells from 40 mins to 20s.

* New:Volume lighting samples use adaptive sampling final gather.

    * Increases their build time by 2x but improves quality in difficult cases (eg. small bright sources of bounce lighting).

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash with threading related to level load with precomputed lighting volumes. 

* Bugfix:Fixed Capsule Shadows artifacting on Skeletal Meshes with scaling.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with HLOD and mesh LODs getting hit by Lightmass ray traces that didn't originate from a mesh.

    * Volume lighting samples and precomputed visibility cells are now only placed on LOD0 (of both mesh LODs and HLOD).

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue so that Lightmap density viewmode will now show the expected component's lightmap resolution when the precomputed lighting is not yet built.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where Actors hidden in game still cast shadows and emit light in Lightmass, which was broken in 4.12.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where atmospheric fog was not working on translucency.

* Bugfix:Fixed issues with hair shading NaNs.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where light shapes were not showing up in reflection captures.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with NaNs resulting from 0 Roughness materials if the light’s "Min Roughness" was also set to 0.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with Single Sample Shadow From Stationary Lights which had been broken from selective GBuffer outputs optimization.

* Bugfix:Fixed a typo in tube lights that should no longer allow them to go negative.

* Bugfix:Fixed per object shadows from point/spot lights to do the light source pull back based on subject box size, not subject radius, since the box is used to find a valid < 90 degree projection.

* Bugfix:Fixed skylights so that they are not captured until their level is made visible.

    * This fixes the case where skylights capture too early.

* Bugfix:Fixed height fog to now work properly in planar reflections.

* Bugfix:Fixed HLODs to now work with static and dynamic shadowing.

* Lighting channels can now be edited on components with static mobility, since dynamic lights can still affect them.

* Improved hair shading when lit by non shadow casting light.

* Improved screen space reflection quality.

#### Materials

* New:Added a purely computational Perlin-style noise to the Noise material node. 

    * Unlike texture-based noise, this one will never repeat.

* New:Added material property "Allow Negative Emissive Color” which is useful when rendering to an offscreen render target.

* New:New material functions available.These were incorrectly listed in the previous release but are available now.

    * 1D to 2D Index - Convert given input from 1d to 2d.

    * 1D to 3D Index - Convert given input from 1d to 3d.

    * 2D to 1D Index - Convert given input from 2d to 1d.

    * 3D to 1D Index - Convert given input from 3d to 1d.

    * Contrast Preserve Color - Allows you to adjust the contrast of an image without adjusting the colors.

    * Luminosity and Color - Allows you to separately specify the Luminosity and Color to create an output image.

    * Landscape Manual UVW - A helper function to help map textures and height gradients to landscapes.

    * Chroma Key Alpha - This is a green screen type node that extracts a mask based on the specified chroma color.

    * Distance Limited Reflections - This returns parallax corrected reflections conformed to a sphere.

    * Brick and Tile UVs - A useful function for creating pseudo random UVs for procedural texture creation.

    * Texture Bombing - A material function that multi-samples a texture with random offsets to reduce tiling artifacts.

    * Texture Bombing POM - An experimental function combining texture bombing with Parallax Occlusion Mapping.Note this function is extremely expensive.

* New:Added new console variables "r.Streaming.FullyLoadUsedTextures 1" to load all used textures to their max resolution.

    * Used as an alternative to disabling texture streaming with "r.TextureStreaming 0".

    * Takes less memory as only used texture get streamed in.

* New:Panner nodes now have an optional speed input.

* New:Support for setting Scalar and Vector Materials by Index rather than by name on MIDs. 

    * This feature allows much better performance in cases where large numbers of parameters are being set per frame and where the indices can be cached by the calling code in an initialization step.

* New:Textures have an Alpha Preservation property which dictates how much of a channel's coverage to preserve when generating mipmaps.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when passing a Vector4 to a "Transform Position" material node. 

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where Texture group and texture LOD Bias setting would be applied twice in cooked builds.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with texture streaming where Skeletal Meshes would understream textures. 

* Bugfix:Fixed an edge-case causing negative blend results on tri-planar mapping material function.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where "Invalid Lightmap Settings" display material for instanced meshes.

* Bugfix:Fixed the Shader Complexity viewmode for materials using depth pixel offset.

    * This could cause masked materials to appear cheaper than they actually are.

* Bugfix:Fixed a typo on `If` material node inputs.

* Bugfix:Fixed various material compile errors of the form "Undeclared identifier LocalX" caused by interpolation optimization.

* Removed additional material node created when adding a "Rotate About Axis" node.

#### Postprocessing

* Bugfix:Fixed a regression (seen only in SM4) that could break the fixed shutter exposure.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with ghosting in the screen space reflections when temporal AA is disabled.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue with occasional flickering visual artifacts in the motion blur.

* Bugfix:Fixed post-processing not working correctly in case project Mobile HDR setting is off, on non-mobile platforms.

#### Optimizations

* New:Added a 'resource' name for landscape to improve display in the mesh summary list of Profile GPU.

* New:Added a way to control how far down the HLOD hierarchy to allow showing (can be used to limit quality loss and streaming texture memory usage on high scalability settings).

    * Controlled by the new cvar "r.HLOD.MaximumLevel", which can be set to the following values:

        * -1:No maximum level (default)

        * 0:Prevent ever showing a HLOD cluster instead of individual meshes

        * 1:Allow only the first level of HLOD clusters to be shown

        * 2+:Allow up to the Nth level of HLOD clusters to be shown

    * Note:This does not affect the memory used by the HLOD meshes itself or their always loaded low mip levels, it will only save the memory associated with streaming in the higher mip levels.

* New:Added triangle and draw call summaries to Profile GPU output, broken up by asset and material.

    * This is controlled by "r.ProfileGPU.PrintAssetSummary", which defaults to 1, but you really need “r.ShowMaterialDrawEvents 1” enabled as well for a complete picture.

    * It can also output a summary line for specific asset names using a comma separated list in "r.ProfileGPU.AssetSummaryCallOuts" (e.g., "LOD,HeroName").

* New:Moved Texture streaming computations for dynamic primitives on the worker thread.

* New:Realtime GPU profiler - preview feature (not yet enabled by default).

    * A non-hierarchical, realtime, high level GPU profiler with support for cumulative stat recording.Requires a build with stats enabled (e.g. development).

    * To enable, use "r.gpustatsenabled 1".

    * Stats are visualized with "stat GPU".

    * Additional stat can be added with SCOPED_GPU_STAT macros, e.g. SCOPED_GPU_STAT(RHICmdList, Stat_GPU_Distortion).

* New:Reduced memory allocations when creating sections in a Procedural Mesh Component.

* New:Simple forward shading path for scaling down to low end PC.

    * Support for a directional light in the base pass, which can be shadowed either by distance field shadowmaps or a single shadow factor from the Indirect Lighting Cache.

    * Binding and outputting to GBuffers is disabled when using simple forward shading, along with dependencies of the GBuffers.

    * Specular, normal maps and the 3rd SH band of skylighting are all hardcoded off.Materials are forced fully rough.

    * Enabled with "r.SimpleForwardShading 1", which can be changed at runtime.

    * Added "r.SupportSimpleForwardShading", which determines if the necessary shaders are compiled.

    * Removed "r.SimpleDynamicLighting", whose functionality (unshadowed directional light in the base pass) is a subset of simple forward shading, and was unused.

* Added "FreezeRendering" to the console autocomplete list.

* Added "ProfileGPU" to the console autocomplete list.

* Corrected a misleading help comment on "r.StaticMeshLODDistanceScale", explaining how it affects LOD calculations (it multiplies the effective distance, so larger numbers make transitions happen sooner).

* Updated to d3dcompiler_47.dll offering large speed-up in shader compilation times.

#### Mobile Rendering

* New:Added support for lighting channels on mobile.

    * Multiple directional lights are supported in different channels but primitives are only affected by the directional light in the first channel they have set.

    * CSM shadows from stationary or movable directional lights correctly follow their lighting channels.

    * No channel limitations for dynamic point lights.

* New:Enabled quality level overrides for iOS Metal, Android ES3.1 and Android Vulkan shader platforms.

* New:Renamed "ANDROIDES31" and “OpenGLES31” to “ANDROIDESDEFERRED” and “OpenGLESDeferred” to avoid confusion with mobile renderer supporting ES3.1.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue in which changing mobile preview device type in editor would not rebuild materials.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue that could cause changes to quality overrides in the 'High' quality column to be ignored.

* Bugfix:Fixed "black dots" rendering corruption that may appear on particles with additive blending.

* Bugfix:Fixed decals not rendering on Zenfone 2 (Added proper detection of FP16 render target support).

* Bugfix:Fixed inverted R/B color channels with "r.TonemapperFilm" enabled on Nexus 5 (Android 4.4.4).

* Bugfix:Fixed performance regression introduced in 4.10.Compute pixel world position in vertex shader instead of doing it in pixel shader.

* Mobile DoF now requires DoF type to be Gaussian otherwise DoF will be disabled.

### UI

* Bugfix:Fixed a regression that broke safe zone debugging features in Windows.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue in a Slate List Panel so that those with horizontal arrangement (i.e. from Slate Tile View) use the number of desired items instead of the number of actual items in order to calculate the desired size of the geometry.

    * This fixes the case where a Slate Tile View is contained within a Slate Scroll Box; the Slate Tile View is now allowed to expand to its full size within the Slate Scroll Box.

* All textures in the UI texture group (TextureGroup_UI), should now render a lot smoother if they have mipmaps.Removed code that was forcing all UI textures to mip level 0.If this behavior was desired by anyone, you can use the cvar "r.ForceHighestMipOnUITextures" to re-enable it.

* Sound Concurrency asset now has a unique icon.

#### Slate

* New:Added input settings:

    * Control if the viewport locks the mouse on acquire capture.

    * Control if the viewport acquires capture on the application launch (first window activate).

* New:Slate Remote Server (for the iOS touch input app) is now disabled by default, so we do not open up the socket unless desired by the user.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash if a Slate widget tried to refresh itself while the editor is shutting down.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash that could happen when the fallback/last resort font was missing.

* Bugfix:Fixed a potential crash when shutting down Slate if the font services were shut down first.

* Bugfix:Fixed regression in editable text box alignment.

    * Text was no longer vertically aligned center since editable text was converted to use a text layout.This vertical alignment is now handled by the outer editable text box instead.

* Bugfix:Fixed the Scroll Box widget improperly clamping by content size.

* Bugfix:Fixed some measuring issues with bi-directional text within a right-flowed document.

    * This could cause text to sometimes significantly under-measure and lead to wrapping issues.

* Significant performance improvements when pasting a large amount of text.

* Made sure the slide handle of a Slider Widget no longer gets cut off at the edges of the slider.

* Slider widget will no longer consume OnKeyDown events that they do not handle.

* Updated ScrollBy function on ScrollBox widget to work properly when called while the widget is animating.

#### UMG

* New:Added ability to replace the widget the track is currently bound to.Also includes changes in Widget Blueprint Editor to send delegate to Animation Tab Summoner when switching from Graph to Designer.

* New:Adding ability to animate the root (owner) widget in UMG.

    * Hierarchy Root adds the preview widget instead of the CDO to selected objects in widget blueprint.The properties are then migrated back to the CDO.

* New:Added additional styling options for the default items that are created in the combobox, such as Font.

* New:Updated playback speed so that it can now be specified when starting a UMG animation.

* New:Updated the Palette in UMG to no longer display widget content coming from Engine or Developer folders, based on the same setting configured in the content browser.If you're not showing Engine content in the Content Browser, you should no longer see all the User Widgets that were added to support the VR Editor.

* New:Updated the Widget Component to extend from the Mesh Component.It can now have a custom material applied to it in order to achieve cooler effects - like ignoring the depth buffer.

    * Users who use this option are encouraged to start with the widget components default material and work from there, as you need to start by sampling a texture parameter called Slate UI.

    * The widget component now offers the ability to automatically size the render target to be the desired size of the widget - note that this could go really bad if your widget's desired size is very large.

* New:Added a new Slate Texture Atlas Interface that any UObject can now implement if it wishes to integrate with UMG to provide texture atlas data in a form Slate can understand and render.

    * For reference you can look at "Paper Sprite" which implements this interface allowing Paper 2D Sprites to be used on Slate Brushes.

* New:Added "Get Url" method and “On Url Changed” property to the Web Browser widget.

* New:Added meta flags for "Determines Output Type" and “Dynamic Output Param” to “Get All Widgets Of Class” in the Widget Blueprint Library, removing the need for the extra cast. 

    * The output pin now becomes the same as the type requested.

* New:Worked on better support for VR interactions with Slate widgets by introducing the Widget Interaction Component and performance improvements to the Widget Component.

    * Direct mouse interaction with World Space widgets in the virtual world is no longer supported.Those kinds of interactions must all use the Widget Interaction Component now.

    * Performance improvements - the viewport no longer arranges all 3D widgets every frame.

    * Widget Components now support several methods for reducing how often they redraw to help control performance, they also support manual refresh.This automatically works in tandem with the widget interaction component to request refresh whenever the widget interaction component is interacting with the widget, thus giving you a simple way to only redraw widgets that the user is hovering over them.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash when using "Use Selected asset from Content Browser" for font materials when the selected asset is not a material.

* Bugfix:Fixed animation playback not playing the full length if it starts on a negative time.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug where magenta-color text added to a Widget Blueprint would turn gray when the blueprint was compiled.

* Bugfix:Fixed Widget Component to render widget in the correct position when Constrain Aspect Ratio is enabled.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug where audio track from UMG doesn't play correctly in PIE.

* Bugfix:Fixed "Is Hovered" on “User Widgets”.The Object Widget did not properly call the super for Mouse Enter/Mouse Leave preventing the Widget's implementation from setting the correct state.

* Bugfix:Fixed the "Designer Rebuild" flag detection so that we can just refresh the slate widget without recreating the preview UObject, which causes the destruction of the details panel, and the slate widget recreation was the only part that was required.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where the web browser widget plugin wasn't loading soon enough to be properly loaded in time if it was referenced by game content that loads in the Default stage of the pipeline, so moving it to PreDefault.

* Set viewed animation to current animation after switching from Graph to Designer (This is for "No Animation Selected" showing up when switching).

* Removed the "Designer Widget Tree", instead directly injecting the widget tree into the partially constructed User Widget during design time, when refreshing the preview.

    * This avoids updating the living class instance with a new designer tree that all new instances of the class would become biased to using.

    * Making the preview widget explicitly non-transactional as there's no reason to track changes to the preview, all the changes that need to be tracked should be on the template widget.This should fix the crash in the widget designer when you undo just after compiling the widget blueprint.

* Changed the Input Key Selector Widget to no longer add a bogus Selected Key property to the details panel.

* Updated the Slider widget to now allow the thumbsticks to also control movement of the slider when it's in edit mode, via controller input.

* Widgets transferred from one Widget Blueprint to another Widget Blueprint will now allow both to render and compile correctly.

### VR

* New:Added a "Start in VR" project setting, which will force a project to try and start in VR mode, regardless of whether or not it has -vr specified on the commandline.

* New:Added additional Motion Controller types, to allow for extension to devices that have more than just left and right trackers.

* New:Added GoogleVR (Cardboard) support for iOS, updated SDK.

* New:Added Oculus 1.6 runtime support.

* New:Added fix for flickering shadows on translucent surfaces in VR.

* New:Updated haptics system so that it can now take a buffer of values to playback asynchronously on devices.

* New:Added PlayStation VR '2DVR' reprojection mode.

    * 2DVR is a way to display a static image on a quad temporarily while in VR output mode.Intended for loading screens, etc.

    * Exposed to blueprint through Morpheus Function Library.

* New:Implemented HMD Setup dialogs for PlayStation VR at startup and if the HMD is disconnected at runtime.

* New:Exposed PlayStation VR "Hmd Reprojection Set Output Min Color" function to blueprint.

    * Sets the minimum output color from reprojection processing.Can be used to mitigate certain vr artifacts (including dark smearing and rendered area edge visibility).

    * Note:Tone Mapping and Color Correction can achieve some of the same effects, but are cross-platform.

* New:Added Steam VR Stereo Layer Support.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash when running with an HMD with no microphone.

* Bugfix:Fixed a crash with the Steam Controller plugin enabled where applying a dynamic force feedback to the controller could crash the editor.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash when polling for position and orientation of an HMD from animation skel controls.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash with Gear VR when transitioning levels with an active HUD.

* Bugfix:Fixed bloom artifacts when changing screen percentage in VR.

* Bugfix:Fixed module loading race condition in Steam VR plugin.

* Bugfix:Fixed assert on Google Daydream soon after startup (likely related to heat-induced throttling).

* Bugfix:Fixed Motion Controllers on remote clients using data from attached motion controllers.Can now replicate motion controllers across the network without having local devices interfere.

* Bugfix:Fixed outstanding issues with OSVR rendering performance and stereo convergence in the headset.

* Prevented the output log from being spammed for every single shader compile when instanced stereo is enabled for a shader platform that doesn't support it.

* Updated Steam VR detection code to now use a lighter weight function, which will not launch Steam VR unless it is chosen as the active platform.

* New:Renamed 'LocalAtoms' to 'BoneSpaceTransforms' and 'SpaceBases' to 'ComponentSpaceTransforms' to make it clearer what they are.

* Bugfix:FAnimInstanceProxy::EvaulateAnimation is now split into two for easier extensibility.

* Removed UPROPERTY from transient properties in SkinnedMeshComponent (PredictedLODLevel, OldPredictedLODLevel & MaxDistanceFactor).

#### Audio

* New:Allowed AudioVolume to be subclassed outside Engine module.

* New:Threaded Audio.

* Removed USoundWave::CompressionName.

* Added USoundWave::HasCompressedFormat.

#### Automation

* Added map name to editortest command line in UAT.

#### Blueprints

* New:UEdGraphSchema_K2::GetVariableTypeTree now uses an enum filter rather than multiple boolean parameters.

* Bugfix:Crash fix in FKismetDebugUtilities::GetWatchText()

* Bugfix:Fixed a compiler warning in FBlueprintVarActionDetails::GetVariableReplicationType where a local variable was hiding a member variable.

* Deprecated FName UEdGraphNode::GetPaletteIcon(FLinearColor&) in favor of FSlateIcon UEdGraphNode::GetIconAndTint(FLinearColor&) to allow for icons in external style sets to be used.

* UInheritableComponentHandler::GetAllTemplates() is now exposed as a callable API outside of the editor context.

#### Core

* New:Added FMath::ClosestPointOnInfiniteLine() to distinguish it from the (poorly named) ClosestPointOnLine() that actually works on segments.

* New:Added a CopyTemp function for making a temporary as a copy (instead of a move) of an object to aid visibility of unintended copies of setter functions defined only as taking an rvalue reference.

* New:Added a DEPRECATED_MACRO deprecation macro for deprecating macros.

* New:Added a new LerpRange function to allow interpolation of FRotator without taking the shortest path.

* New:Added Algo::Copy and Algo::Transform.

* New:Added C++11 initializer list support to TArray and TSet.

* New:Added Core/Containers/TArrayView based on Engine/FixedSizeArrayView.

    * TArrayView allows a function to accept a range of elements as if it was taking a TArray, while allowing the caller to pass any of:

        * TArray (with any allocator)

        * C Array

        * Pointer + Size

        * Initializer list!

    * Note:The new and improved TArrayView is not const-propogating. const TArrayView<T> does not imply "const T" and will not bind to a const TArray!

        * You want TArrayView<const T> as the parameter in 99% of functions that would currently take a const TArray<T>&.Note:TArrayView should be a value parameter, not a reference.

* New:Added FastDecimalFormat overloads to write into an existing string.

    * This helps avoid an extra allocation if you already have a pre-sized string that you're writing the number to (as is the case in FText::Format).

* New:Added Find and FindByPredicate algorithms for operating on arbitrary ranges.

* New:Added LexicalConversion::ToString overloads for const CharType* and bool.

* New:Added move semantics support to TArray::HeapPush.

* New:Added some extra logging information when a class fails to hot reload.

* New:Added static version of FName::IsValidXName.

    * This allows you to verify name-like strings without having to convert them to an FName (and thus add them to the name table)

* New:Added TArray::EmplaceAt for direct construction of array elements at a given index.

* New:Added TWeakObjectPtrMapKeyFuncs as the KeyFuncs for TMaps which use TWeakObjectPtr as a key, so that the map is not invalidated when the pointer becomes stale.

* New:Added Visual Studio debugger visualization of TTuples of up to 6 elements.

* New:All configuration files are now scanned for an Engine section containing TaggedPropertyRedirects.This allows plugin configurations to register their own property redirects in cases where a property's name changes.Please note that this engine section will ONLY be searched for TaggedPropertyRedirects, and no other options are currently inspected for non-Engine configuration files.

* New:Async Loading will no longer wait for all packages to finish serializing before calling PostLoad on packages that have already been serialized.

* New:Errors are now raised when a UnrealHeaderTool markup is in a skipped preprocessor block.

* New:Exposed the Key and Value typedefs for TMap and TSet.

* New:FModuleManager::UnloadOrAbandonModuleWithCallback's 'abandon only' functionality has been split into its own function.

* New:Garbage Collector will no longer be responsible for generating class token stream.Instead the token stream will be generated on startup or when a (Blueprint) class has finished loading.

* New:Made check() calls assume the condition is true even in !DO_CHECK builds.

* New:Made FFeedbackContext's Errors and Warnings list thread safe.

* New:Made the TAnd, TAndValue, TOr and TOrValue metafunctions variadic.

* New:Prevented FStrings being concatenated with integers, as this would concatenate a Unicode character of the value of that integer, rather than the expected decimal string representation of that integer.

* New:Removed obsolete PLATFORM_COMPILER_HAS_EXPLICIT_OPERATORS, FORCEINLINE_EXPLICIT_OPERATOR_BOOL and SAFE_BOOL_OPERATORS macros.

* New:Split inline shader registration from serialization.Serialization can happen on the async loading thread but registration should only happen on the game thread.Removed a lot of critical section locks.

* New:UEngine now defines a Start() function that subclasses can use to start game related things after initialization of the engine.

    * This is done so that after the Init() call on UEngine, we can then perform a module load for the ELoadingPhase::PostEngineInit phase of loading, then inform the UEngine that it's time to start the game.

    * UGameEngine now uses the Start() phase to tell the GameInstance to Start, rather than at the base of Init(), before all modules have had a chance to load.

* New:Unified output formatting across FOutputDeviceFile, FOutputDeviceMemory and FOutputDeviceArchiveWrapper and fixed potential race conditions caused by serializing log lines in chunks.

* New:UStruct::SerializeTaggedProperties has been restructured to use new virtual UProperty::ConvertFromType for backwards compatibility type conversions.

* New:Added ForceInline to TIndexedContainerIterator<...>::operator!=(...). 

    * This change improved DebugGame performance of a for loop using ranged-based syntax significantly.

* New:Added an assert to PackageTools::GetFilteredPackageList to help track down a bad object.

* Bugfix:Crash fix for intermittent issue that does not delete linkers during FFeedbackContext::ProgressReported().

* Bugfix:Fix hang in FTaskGraphInterface::BroadcastSlow_OnlyUseForSpecialPurposes caused by back to back calls.

* Bugfix:Fixed a hash conflict that could occur when both the case-sensitive and case-insensitive FName hashes were identical.

* Bugfix:Fixed a long-standing issue with undo/redo nulling lazy pointers.

    * This particularly affected Landscape.

* Bugfix:Fixed comparisons of UnrealHeaderTool manifests which may affect UHT makefile correctness.

* Bugfix:Fixed const correctness in UObject* overload of IPropertyHandle::SetValue.

* Bugfix:Fixed const correctness of FLogCategoryBase::IsSuppressed.

* Bugfix:Fixed hot reload on Mac when there are no changes.

* Bugfix:Fixed many Visual Studio static analysis warnings.

* Bugfix:Fixed some hot reload output which was being reported as warnings.

* Bugfix:Fixed the parsing of non-ISO8601 datetimes in JSON.

* Bugfix:Fixed UnrealHeaderTool generating the wrong properties for int and unsigned int when the build environment's int sizes differ from the the target environment.

* Bugfix:Fixed 'unreferenced local variable' warnings used in UE_CLOG macros when logging is disabled.

* Bugfix:Fixed three bugs required for script support to work properly.

* Added a non-const version of MultiFindPointer() to TMultiMap.

* Added a proper forwarding constructor to FAsyncTask to allow references to be passed.

* Clarified some wording in TFunction assert messages and comments.

* FAsyncPackage now creates the meta-data before processing the remaining exports

    * This matches the behavior of FLinkerLoad::LoadAllObjects, as other objects may depend on the meta-data being loaded before them.

* Improved Algo::Accumulate when used with movable types (e.g. FString).

* Made GetDefault<T>(UClass*) assert that the class is castable to T. Otherwise it is an unsafe cast.

* Made sure async loading is not marked as complete until all async packages have been deleted.

* Made sure SQLLite database handle is nulled after it's been closed.

* Optimized some FString and FPaths functions to produce fewer temporary strings.

* Prevented the possibility of move constructors and move assignment operators being defined in UCLASSes.

* Removed a developer-only check in STATS which was generating lots of redundant strings.

* Removed obsolete macro-based delegate implementation.

* Removed PLATFORM_COMPILER_HAS_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES.

* Replaced some check()s with checkSlow()s in the container allocators.

* Reversed the order the UObject delete listeners were notified of UObject deletion to avoid skipping the next listener if the current one removed itself from the array.

* Split up TTypeTraits into multiple individual traits to avoid erroneous VS2015 compiler errors and for composability.

* Stomp allocator can now be used in the editor builds.At least in smaller projects.

* Stopped FError::Throwf from being usable outside of UnrealHeaderTool.

* Suspending or resuming thread heartbeat will not generate a heartbeat for threads that haven't sent any heartbeats yet.

* When using FFeedbackContextAnsi messages logged with Display verbosity will no longer be added to the Warnings array.

* Worked around some spurious VS2015 compiler errors in defaulted and deleted class functions.

#### Editor and Tools

* New:Added FAssetData::GetTagValue and FAssetData::GetTagValueRef to handle getting asset tag values in a type-correct way.

    * This allows type-conversion using LexicalConversion, and also has specializations for FString, FText, and FName.

* New:Added LANDSCAPE_API to Landscape MaterialExpression classes so user-created modules can make use of them.

* New:Allowed whitespaces for meta class names.Ex:UPROPERTY(meta = (AllowedClasses = "Texture2D, MaterialInterface")) will now show both Texture2D and MaterialInterface types.

* New:Removed the default "Toggle Pause/Play" command keybinding from BaseInput.ini and made this a customizable keybinding option in the "Editor Preferences".

* New:UBT on windows will now look for existence of a "UE4CSharp.prog" file next to a C# program project, that would like to be added to the UE4.sln.

* Changed function signature for FSequencer::NotifyMovieSceneDataChanged so that it takes an enum describing the type of change.

* World Outliner now correctly calls ProcessEditDelete on editor modes that have asked to process delete operations

##### Landscape

* Bugfix:Fixed Landscape class hierarchy.

    * LandscapeProxy is now LandscapeStreamingProxy.

    * A new base class has been added for both Landscape and LandscapeStreamingProxy (called LandscapeProxy).

    * Most code shouldn't notice the change.

#### Gameplay Framework

* New:Added a GetEffectiveFrameRateLimit method to UGameUserSettings, to allow games to override the default behavior for things like a different limit in menus versus gameplay.

* New:Added GetSquaredDistanceToBody to FBodyInstance and virtual GetSquaredDistanceToCollision to UPrimitiveComponent.

* New:Added minor support to data tables to support game-specific post-import fixup of data

    * Added ability to mark variables in data table row structs with the meta field DataTableImportOptional, which implies the variable is not necessarily expected to be in the imported source file as a column (warnings won't be generated on import).Useful for variables that will only be populated by a post-import step in code.

    * Added a new method, OnPostDataImport, to FTableRowBase to allow games to provide custom parsing, fix-up, etc. of data imported into data tables.

    * Fixed the data table importer dialog to show data table row structs alphabetically.

* New:Added support for UNumericProperty (int64, etc...) and doubles as allowable types in data table structures.

    * Note:Blueprints still can't access these types, so use is limited to C++ for now.

* New:Added time spent in each hitch bucket to the FPS chart .log output and analytics output.

* New:AHUD::WhiteColor, GreenColor, and RedColor have been made static const and deprecated.Use FColor::White, Green, and Red instead.

* New:Made CalcSceneView and GetProjectionData in ULocalPlayer virtual.

* New:Marked engine performance target cvars ECVF_Scalability so they can be adjusted via scalability buckets at runtime for games that target different framerates on different levels of hardware.

* New:Scalability buckets can now have more or fewer than 4 entries, controlled by sg.[BucketName].NumLevels cvars.

* New:SceneComponent AttachChildren, AttachParent, AttachSocketName are now private.Use GetAttachChildren/Parent/SocketName, AttachTo, or SetupAttachment as appropriate.

* New:UActorComponent::GetWorld() marked final and inlined to optimize overhead.

* New:Until now the only type used for attributes in the gameplay ability system has been floats.A new type, FGameplayAttributeData, has been added.At some point in the future, support for float based attributes will probably be removed.At that point only attributes using the FGameplayAttributeData struct or a struct derived from it will be valid attributes.Until then it is possible for projects to have both FGameplayAttributeData and float based attributes.

* New:Added comment to FHitResult for ImpactPoint to explain behavior when it's penetrating.

* New:Added nullptr checks to ProceduralMeshComponent's SceneProxy.

* New:Added perf stat for SetHitResultFromShapeAndFaceIndex().

* New:GetNetMode() optimizations.

    * Added IsNetMode() which is more efficient in non-editor builds when considering dedicated servers.

    * Wrapped in inline functions that check IsDedicatedServer() where possible.

    * Converted some components to use new methods.

* New:AHUD::bShowHUD now defaults to true

* New:Minor optimization in UGameplayTagsManager::FindTagNode() to stop taking copies of a tags children array and churning memory.

* Bugfix:Crash fix when calling FAudioDevice::CreateComponent as part of shut down.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash when ShouldSpawnAtStartPoint returns true if Player->StartSpot is null.

* Bugfix:Fixed issue that could cause the data table reimporter to change the reimported table back to a base Data Table class instance instead of the previously imported subclass, in the event of using subclasses of Data Table.

* Bugfix:Fixed optimization to IsLocalController() using wrong platform define.

* Bugfix:Fixed overlaps being dropped from within a FScopedMoveUpdate when rotation occurs.Removed invalid assert.

* Bugfix:Fixed Net relevant WorldSettings objects so they no longer inadvertently end up in the Actors array twice.

* Bugfix:Fixed seamless travel so that if it chooses not to carry a GameMode over, it will now correctly create a new one.

* Bugfix:Fixed the UEngine::GetAllLocalPlayerControllers function to no longer add null entries to the output PlayerList array, which was possible in some rare cases before.

* Changed the code in AActor::IncrementalRegisterComponents to obey bAutoRegister for the root component rather than asserting that it is true.Note:If children components have bAutoRegister=true, they will still pull the root component into the fray and cause it to be registered first.

* Converted TAutoConsoleVariables in CharacterMovementComponent to FAutoConsoleVariableRefs in (renamed) CharacterMovementCVars namespace.

    * Avoids need for GetValueOnGameThread() which was adding unnecessary overhead and preventing some users from easily multithreading portions of the code.

* Disabled concurrent tick queuing in Windows.

* Embedded FPS chart preamble/postamble/row .html files into ChartCreation.cpp to permanently solve packaging woes.

* FTickableGameObjects will no longer tick multiple times when multiple worlds are ticking, such as having a BP preview world, a persona world, or multiple PIE instances.

* Made FSavedMove_Character::CanCombineWith easier to debug.Consolidated duplicate code to one block.

* Marked FHitResult, FOverlapResult, FOverlapInfo as POD types.Avoids destructors etc when in TArrays.

* Optimized UCapsuleComponent::CalcBounds() to remove sqrt and use tighter bounding sphere radius.

* Optimized AudioComponent to set bUseAttachParentBounds=true to reduce cost of transform updates (avoids virtual CalcBounds() when transform changes).

* Optimized character networking to remove allocations after initial spawn from client saved move processing.

* Prevented ACharacter::bNotifyJumpApex from being editable and cleaned up comments.

* Reduced allocations during movement and overlap queries and when fetching shapes from physx actors.

* Reduced allocations in UI Canvas items.

* Reduced allocations in UObjectBase::CreateStatID().It throws off profiling results significantly in some cases.

* Worked around some of the drawbacks of Windows scheduler.This would occasionally cause hitches on quad core machines with additional load in the tick task manager.

* Wrapped call from UCharacterMovementComponent::PostPhysicsTickComponent() to UpdateBasedMovement() in a FScopedMovementUpdate to accumulate moves with better perf.

#### Localization

* New:Added the ability to version each localized string individually when loaded into the localization manager.

    * The single 32-bit global history has now been replaced with two 16-bit histories.One is global, and is updated whenever the culture is changed (or a LocRes file is loaded), and the other is local to each string, and is updated if the display string is changed outside of a culture update (to handle cases where the display string is changed, but the key is preserved).Changing the global history will reset all local histories.

* Renamed FContext to FManifestContext to better reflect its purpose and avoid naming conflicts with other code.

#### Networking

* New:Added support for prioritizing actors for replay recording.This feature can be used along with the per-frame recording time limit (see UDemoNetDriver::SetMaxDesiredRecordTimeMS) to improve playback quality for the important actors in the scene.

    * This feature is enabled by calling UDemoNetDriver::SetActorPrioritizationEnabled on the recording UDemoNetDriver.

    * If desired, customize the priority of actors by overriding the AActor::GetReplayPriority function.This works similarly to the AActor::GetNetPriority function for non-replay replication.

    * You may also override the viewer used for the priority calculation with the UDemoNetDriver::SetViewerOverride function.

* New:Added the ability to limit the size of the buffer used by the in-memory replay streamer (FInMemoryNetworkReplayStreamer).

    * This will prevent the memory buffer that stores the replay data from growing unbounded over the course of a game.Only the most recent data will be kept, so it won't be possible to play back the replay from an earlier time that's no longer in the buffer.

    * To set the buffer size, call INetworkReplayStreamer::SetTimeBufferHintSeconds on an instance of FInMemoryNetworkReplayStreamer.The implementation will keep at least the most recent desired number of seconds available for playback.

* New:Added the ability to pause and resume replay recording, and get the current paused state.See UDemoNetDriver::PauseRecording and UDemoNetDriver::IsRecordingPaused.

* New:Added the ability to set a desired per-frame time limit for recording replays.The time is not guaranteed, but setting it can help reduce the CPU load of replay recording in exchange for potentially lower quality playback.

    * After the time limit is hit, additional actors that would have been recorded on the current frame will be deferred until a future frame.Since these actors are being recorded at a lower frequency, this may cause a reduction in playback quality.

    * To set the desired per-frame time limit, call UDemoNetDriver::SetMaxDesiredRecordTimeMS on the recording UDemoNetDriver.

    * This feature may be combined with replay actor prioritization (see UDemoNetDriver::SetActorPrioritizationEnabled) to record important actors at a higher frequency and maintain more playback quality.

* New:Updated the FUniqueNetId of a connecting client to be passed along in the client beacons so the server can tell who is making requests.

* New:Added ENGINE_API to FRepMovement, as the constructor is in a source file.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue that could cause arrays to get out of sync with the game server when using a FFastArraySerializer with predictive elements and recording a replay on the client.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where network profiles after the first one created during an execution of the engine would have broken name and address mappings.

* Bugfix:Fixed issue wherein replicated actors destroyed on the server would not always be properly destroyed on the client when used in conjunction with network dormancy and queued bunches.

* Any actors that are set not to load on the client (bNetLoadOnClient = false) will be force deleted when initializing a level’s actors on a client.

* Fixed misspelling in comment in NetworkVersion.h.

* Corrected filename case in #include "IPAddress.h" statement.

#### Online

* New:FQosInterface::GetDefaultRegionString() has been replaced by FQosInterface::GetRegionId().It is just a rename of the function

* New:FUniqueNetIdRepl is stored on the UNetConnection and passed into engine login functions rather than TSharedPtr<FUniqueNetId> as it is a more robust wrapper of the same data.

* New:Added a base class UpdateManager that can coordinate patch and hotfix checks inside a game.Taking advantage of the OnlineHotfixManager class can help setup a basic infrastructure for using that class to check for hotfixes while the game is running.

* New:Added an Expiration Date field to FOnlineStoreOffer.This field defaults to Unreal Max Time.

* New:Added the capability for actors to temporarily pause replication of themselves over a certain channel.This can significantly reduce bandwidth costs and reduce cheating.ShooterGame has implemented an example - look for AShooterCharacter::IsReplicationPausedForConnection and AShooterCharacter::OnReplicationPausedChanged.

* Bugfix:Fixed issues with FSocketBSD::Recv returning false on SE_EWOULDBLOCK when polling a non-blocking socket.

* FSocketBSD::Recv, RecvFrom and the IPv6 equivalents will now return false when recv returns 0, which indicates the connection was shutdown in an orderly manner.

#### Other

* New:Added Framework zip paths to list of required external files when precompiling targets.

* New:Added support for per file Intellisense PCH settings, which greatly improves its startup speed.

    * Set bUsePerFileIntellisense to true to activate, which can be done through your local BuildConfiguration.xml file.

    * This has been seen to use a lot more memory and even cause crashes in large Visual Studio solutions.Only supported after VS2015 Update 3.

* New:Added TArray<FString> support to FAnalyticsEventAttribute.

* New:Made a first pass at async loading improvements.Mostly disabled.

* New:Removed hard coded staging of dlls for Crash Reporter and use its receipt instead.

* New:Added validation of tag names to FindOrAddTagSet so that they only contain a single '#' character and any spaces come after.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue in ability system where gameplay effect handles would be improperly invalidated whenever a sublevel was loaded.

* Ensured that TempStorageFileList uses forward slashes as its path separators so that it's easily used on Mac and Windows.

* Improved the CPU burden of loading in several places.Made substantial progress on the complete loading revamp (currently disabled).

* Removed EnterScope and LeaveScope from ReadGraphBody so that included files are treated as being in the same scope (allows use of properties across files).

#### Paper2D

* New:Added PAPER2D_API to FSpriteDrawCallRecord so it can be used externally.

#### Physics

* New:Exported ConvertToCollisionChannel, ConvertToObjectType and ConvertToTraceType members of UCollisionProfile.

* New:Exposed mobility filtering query params.This allows users to filter out static mobility, for example from scene queries.

* New:Refactored constraint instance so that we can easily swap parameters at runtime using profiles.

* Bugfix:Fixed Unreal collision bounds calculation not accounting for rotation of convex elements.

#### Platforms

* Bugfix:Fixed bVerfiyPeer flag to only be set after CertBundlePath has been set, otherwise trying to verify the SSL session without any cert file doesn't make sense.

* Made sure dSYM generation action in UBT on Mac does not start before the source dylib is ready.

##### Android

* New:Added a new variable to AndroidRuntimeSettings called "bCreateAllPlatformsInstall" that makes packaging create install files for all platforms (PC and Mac/Linux).

* Renamed FManifestReader to FAndroidFileManifestReader in AndroidFile to prevent conflict.

* Ensured that the OnControllerConnectionChange delegates will now properly dispatch on a gamepad connection.

##### iOS

* New:Added PRAGMA_DISABLE_OPTIMIZATION_ACTUAL and PRAGMA_ENABLE_OPTIMIZATION_ACTUAL defines for iOS.

##### Linux

* Updated LinuxToolChain to use the same output delegate for all of its actions when cross-compiling.

    * This avoids the compile and link actions being split into different batches.

##### Mac

* New:Added a check if UnrealBuildTool.csproj exists before trying to compile it in Mac GenerateProjectFiles.sh.Fixes a problem in binary distribution where the script would show an error (but still succeed) due to missing UnrealBuildTool.csproj.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bug in Kismet where a reference to an element within a TMap was being used to add a new value, which results in use-after-free as the memory is reallocated before initialising the new element.

* Bugfix:Fixed compilation on iOS 10 by disabling depth-clip mode on iOS, despite earlier headers it isn't actually available.

* Bugfix:Fixed UBT not building on non HFS partitions on OSX.

* Bugfix:Crash fix in USoundNodeLooping::NotifyWaveInstanceFinished.

* Changed BinnedAllocFromOS/BinnedFreeToOS/PageProtect on Apple platforms to use mmap/munmap/mprotect to match expected behaviour.

* Disabled the "-Wdelete-non-virtual-dtor " warning on iOS, tvOS & macOS.

* Implemented RHIGetSupportedResolution & RHIGetAvailableResolutions for Mac Metal.

* Made bGeneratedSYMFile true by default and changed some ifs in Mac UBT code so that non-debug configs always build dSYM files on Mac, unless bGeneratedSYMFile is set to false in BuildConfiguration.xml.

##### Playstation 4

* New:Added validation that the texture pool size is not set to automatic (-1), so it fails with a helpful error message rather than a crash attempting to allocate too much memory.

##### Xbox One

* New:Added support for Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.

* New:Added the bDisableSymbolCache to the link environment configuration to allow Xbox One builds to skip the creation of the runtime symbol cache.

    * Disabling the symbol cache creation will slightly decrease build times and increase available memory at runtime, but stacks will be printed without symbols.

* New:Changed appWinPumpMessages so that it doesn't rely on the current thread to retrieve the dispatcher.

* New:Enabled the use of constexpr for the engine on Xbox One.

* New:Unreal Build Tool now generates the correct build environment for Xbox One directly.

    * This method puts less reliance on the environment a build is launched in and eliminates a build issue if the PATH environment variable is too long.

* Bugfix:Fixed an issue where builds could fail if the DurangoXDK environment variable did not contain a trailing slash.

* Disabled a warning that was impacting some users because of a toolchain issue.

##### HTML5

* New:The Engine will now obtain the game's w&h resolution with javascript.

* New:Allowed use of TMaps in JSON.

* Emscripten SDK moved from Engine/Source/ThirdParty/HTML5/emsdk to Engine/Extras/ThirdPartyNotUE/emsdk.

* Ensured HTML5 LaunchOn with pathnames that contain whitespaces is now handled properly - escape quotes needs to be escaped itself.

##### Windows

* Bugfix:Fixed errors compiling WmfMedia and SteamVR plugins for Windows XP.

#### Programming

* New:Added compatibility for Visual Studio 2015 Update 3.

* New:Added feature to reuse existing response files if the contents are unchanged.

* New:Added SlackIntegrations module for sending messages to Slack from UE4 projects.

* New:FActiveMorphTarget is no longer tagged as a USTRUCT.

* New:Fixed an issue where compiling CPP files using the Visual C toolchain could be too long for XGE to process.

* New:The UnrealVS Visual Studio extension now exposes the "UnrealVS.CompileSingleFile" command.Binding to a shortcut key (eg. Ctrl-F7) from the Visual Studio options dialog allows quickly compiling the current file without linking binaries.

* New:Added a UBT config setting to allow overriding the output directory for PCH files.To use, edit Engine\Saved\UnrealBuildTool\BuildConfiguration.xml and add: <BuildConfiguration> <PCHOutputDirectory>D:\TestOutputDir</PCHOutputDirectory> </BuildConfiguration>.

* Changed Unreal Build Tool batch files to use MSBuild version 14 (the version that ships with Visual Studio 2015).

* Ensured that UnrealBuildTool on Windows will now prioritize user settings in the My Documents folder over the one in the AppData folder, but reads both files if present.Previous behavior was to ignore the one with the older timestamp.

* Updated OpenSSL Runtime Dependencies to include VS2015 and remove VS2012.

#### Rendering

* New:Adapted GetStaticBatchElementVisibility to support changing visibility of batches with a single element (for view-dependent culling of static mesh elements).

    * Added GetStaticBatchElementShadowVisibility that allows culling static mesh elements when rendering shadow depths using information about the light.

    * Note:Any user-created vertex factory that implements GetStaticBatchElementVisibility will need to set bRequiresPerElementVisibility on their FMeshBatch.

* New:Added ability to request a screenshot without a file name, for screenshots that won't be written to disk.

* New:Added cvar r.StencilForLODDither, which is compiled into shaders and forces a full prepass when enabled.This allows r.EarlyZPass to remain changeable at runtime (when not forced to a value by features that are enabled).

* New:Added cvars that can be used to force the engine to target shader model 4 instead of shader model 5 on cards from a specific vendor (r.ForceAMDToSM4, r.ForceIntelToSM4, r.ForceNvidiaToSM4).

* New:Added r.D3DDumpD3DAsmFile so d3d shaders dump out an assembly file when dumping shader compilations.

* New:Allowed r.HLOD console command to be used in Test configurations.

* New:Baked out distribution UObjects for particle systems.

* New:Exported AddStreamingManager and RemoveStreamingManager functions on FStreamingManagerCollection.

* New:Added forward renderer initial implementation - not ready for general use.

    * Point and spot lights are culled to a frustum space grid, base pass loops over culled lights.

    * Light culling uses a reverse linked list to avoid a per-cell limit, and the linked list is compacted to an array before the base pass.

    * New cvars to control light culling: r.Forward.MaxCulledLightsPerCell, r.Forward.LightGridSizeZ, r.Forward.LightGridPixelSize.

    * A full Z Prepass is forced with forward shading.This allows deferred rendering before the base pass of shadow projection methods that only rely on depth.

    * Dynamic shadows are packed based on the assigned stationary light ShadowMapChannel, since stationary lights are already restricted to 4 overlapping.

    * GBuffer render targets are still allocated.

    * Fixed several issues in parallax corrected base pass reflections - not blending out box shape, discontinuity in reflection vector, not blending with stationary skylight properly.

    * Forward shading is now used for TLM_SurfacePerPixelLighting translucency in the deferred path.

* New:Moved RHI prefix out of command list macros so you can find callers in a Find in Files for RHIBlendState, etc.

* New:Split ProceduralMeshComponent plugin into Runtime and Editor modules.

* New:Updated VulkanSDK headers and libraries to 1.0.17.0.

* New:Added code to prevent flooding of rendering thread with heartbeats.

* Bugfix:Fixed crash bug in FCanvasBorderItem rendering caused by a null texture dereference.

* Bugfix:Fixed ensures related to ECVF_Scalability.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bad hash on landscape grass components.

* Bugfix:Fixed a critical bug in the render thread fencing that could sometimes cause fences to complete before previous commands.

* Bugfix:Fixed a large number of API validation warnings and errors across all shaders.

* Bugfix:Fixed an uninitialized memory bug in the static mesh scene proxy HLODcoloration visualization code.

* Bugfix:Fixed a bad call to RemoveAt() in FFinalPostProcessSettings::UpdateEntry() causing potential infinite loop.

* Bugfix:FIxed calls to length(float) on Metal, GL & Vulkan.

* Increased stack sizes for thread pools.

* MaterialParameterCollections will now create default resources (uniform buffers) which are used when no valid FScene is present (eg DrawTile while exporting materials to lightmass).

* Potential crash fix on foliage occlusion queries and reflection captures.

* Removed outdated cvar, "r.ShaderModelDebug".

* Removed unused setting bAllowDebugViewmodesOnConsoles (replaced some time ago by r.ForceDebugViewModes).

* Renamed "r.SaveUncompressedEXRFrames" to "r.SaveEXR.CompressionQuality" as part of a refactor.

* Renamed material function "IsUsedWithDeferredDecal" to "IsDeferredDecal".

* Set the "ToggleLight" console command to now be flagged as a cheat.

##### FX

* New:Added a CVar to disable/freeze GPU particle simulation (r.GPUParticle.Simulate).

##### Lighting

* New:Refactored shadow depth.

    * Shadow setup and render target allocation now happens in InitViews, and shadow depth rendering happens at one spot in the frame.This provides control over where shadow depths are rendered for things like async compute, and allows easy atlasing of shadowmaps for forward shading.

    * The 33Mb of shadow depth buffers in FSceneRenderTargets has been removed, and shadow depth buffers are now allocated as needed.Shadow depth memory is now unbounded which can cause Out of Video Memory in extreme cases.

    * A large amount of duplicated code to handle each shadow type has been combined.

    * Cleaner parallel rendering: no more view hacking for the shadow depth pass, no more shadow depths in the middle of translucency.

    * 'vis ShadowDepthAtlas' or 'vis WholeSceneShadowMap' must now be used to visualize the shadow depth textures.

##### Optimizations

* New:Added a cvar that controls unbinding of all texture resources between materials changes in the DX11 renderer (r.UnbindResourcesBetweenDrawsInDX11) to improve the readability of GPA captures, off by default as it has a minor CPU performance impact.

* New:Added a scalability CVar for landscape LOD biasing (r.LandscapeLODBias), which can have a huge impact on triangle count and help low-end vertex bound GPUs.

* New:Made the optimization to combine upscaling/downscaling and tonemapping optional based on the amount of upscaling that will occur.

    * r.Tonemapper.ScreenPercentage has been renamed to r.Tonemapper.MergeWithUpscale.Mode.

    * r.Tonemapper.MergeWithUpscale.Threshold is a new setting used when r.Tonemapper.MergeWithUpscale.Mode is set to 2, which indicates to only try to merge the passes if the ratio of the area before upscale/downscale to the area afterwards is greater than the threshold.

    * This prevents running the tonemapper on all of the target res pixels when the source res is far smaller, as that can cause it to be a loss to merge the passes.

* New:Made sure that Vulkan always runs using an RHI thread.

* Removed a bogus autocomplete for ShowMaterialDrawEvents, which was previously renamed r.ShowMaterialDrawEvents.

#### UI

* Moved FSlateIcon definition to SlateCore.

##### Slate

* New:Added FText property handle type.

    * Required for manipulating FText properties from a slate details customization.

* FExternalDragOperation can now contain both text and file data at the same time.

    * This better mirrors what the OS level drag-and-drop operations are capable of, and some applications will actually give you both bits of data at the same time.

##### UMG

* Demoted errors regarding widget-bound properties when first compiling a newly created widget blueprint - otherwise an ensure occurs.

#### VR

* New:Implemented VRHeadsetLost and VRHeadsetReconnected delegates for PlayStation VR.

* New:Removed ISR's use of SV_CullDistance and now relying only on SV_ClipDistance to cut down on interpolators.

## Upgrade Notes

### C++ API Changes

* SceneComponent AttachChildren, AttachParent, AttachSocketName are now private.Use GetAttachChildren/Parent/SocketName, AttachTo, or SetupAttachment as appropriate.

* Replace uses of AHUD::WhiteColor, GreenColor, and RedColor with FColor::White, Green, and Red.

* In the HTML5JavaScripteFx.js and .h files, the function signature for UE_MakeHTTPDataRequest() has changed.

* With regards to localized strings, because of the change from an int32 to a uint16, 0, rather than INDEX_NONE, is now considered the "unset" value for a history.

* FContext (in our internationalization manifest) has been renamed to FManifestContext to better reflect its purpose and avoid naming conflicts with other code

* References to the USplineComponent members SplineInfo, SplineRotInfo and SplineScaleInfo should now be replaced by calls to GetSplinePointsPosition(), GetSplinePointsRotation() and GetSplinePointsScale(), respectively.

* Overridden implementations of FComponentVisualizer::VisProxyHandleClick must now take a FEditorViewportClient* instead of a FLevelEditorViewportClient* as the first parameter.

### Animation

* Added a validation path to see if mesh hierarchy matches with the animation skeleton when initializing animation.

    * If you have issue with animation not playing, make sure to save the mesh correctly with the skeleton.

    * Additive APIs are fixed to work with it.

* "Get World From Context Object" does not behave the same as in non-game thread.

    * This causes additive scale to save the difference of scale, which means 0 if no difference.If you're doing any math on those FTransform, it won't work correctly anymore due to 0 scale

    * If you have issue with animation not playing, make sure to save the mesh correctly with the skeleton.

    * Additive APIs are fixed to work with it.

* Local Atoms has been changed to Bone Space Transforms, and Space Bases has been changed to Component Space Transforms.This includes functions that were accessing those members.The old methods have been deprecated and need to be updated to use the new functions.

* Several animation related headers are no longer globally included.This means you may need to include them explicitly if you were using those classes.

    * Common examples are Animation/AnimInstance.h, Animation/AnimMontage.h or Animation/AnimNotifies/AnimNotifyState.h

* The SkeletalMesh.h header is no longer globally included, so you may need to explicitly include it in your project.

* The 'rigid' vertex array "Rigid Vertices" in Skel Mesh Chunk has been removed, all vertices are now considered 'soft' (rigid status was not used by GPU skinning).Any code dealing with vertex data will need to be updated.

* FSkelMeshChunk has been removed and properties are moved into FSkelMeshSection.Any code dealing with 'chunks' will need to be updated.

### Audio

* In addition to class changes to support threaded sound evaluation, there are a number of patterns that are no longer viable.

    * It is no longer safe to reference any game state from a Sound Node.Instead game thread classes should marshall relevant data to audio thread owned structures, using "Run Command On Audio Thread" in the Audio Thread.

### Automation

* If you experience regressions in automated tests, they may have been ignoring ensures because they were previously classed as warnings.

### Core

* Code which tries to concatenate a String with an integral value should either explicitly cast to a character type if it should append a char, or changed to use something like "To String" in Lexical Conversion if it should append the string representation of that integer.

* Using Throwf in FError and associated catch blocks should be replaced with a regular C++ throw call and proper exception class.

* PLATFORM_COMPILER_HAS_DEFAULT_FUNCTION_TEMPLATE_ARGUMENTS has been removed.This is now expected to be 1 on all supported platforms.

* PLATFORM_COMPILER_HAS_VARIADIC_TEMPLATES has been removed.This is now expected to be 1 on all supported platforms.

* Replace PLATFORM_COMPILER_HAS_EXPLICIT_OPERATORS usage by assuming it's defined to 1.

    * Replace FORCEINLINE_EXPLICIT_OPERATOR_BOOL with 'FORCEINLINE explicit operator bool'.

    * Remove any usage of SAFE_BOOL_OPERATORS.

* Specializations of Type Traits which override its "Needs Copy Constructor", “Needs Move Constructor”, “Needs Copy Assignment”, “Needs Move Assignment”, and “Needs Destructor” traits will be ignored and compiler-based traits will be used instead.

    * HAS_TRIVIAL_ASSIGN(T), HAS_TRIVIAL_COPY(T) and HAS_TRIVIAL_DESTRUCTOR(T) should be replaced with TIsTriviallyCopyAssignable<T>::Value, TIsTriviallyCopyConstructible<T>::Value and TIsTriviallyDestructible<T>::Value respectively.

    * "TIsFloatType" should be replaced with “TIsFloatingPoint”.

    * "TIsIntegralType" should be replaced with “TIsIntegral”.

    * "TIsSignedIntegralType" should be replaced with “TIsSigned”.

    * "TIsArithmeticType" should be replaced with “TIsArithmetic”.

    * "TIsPointerType" should be replaced with “TIsPointer”.

    * "TNoDestructorType" should be replaced with “TIsTriviallyDestructible”.

* Use of variables inside a DO_CHECK-only block will not compile if the check() is outside a DO_CHECK-only block.Either both or neither should be inside the block.

* When "Unload Or Abandon Module With Callback" in the Module Manager would be called with a third bool argument, that argument should be removed (if the bool is 'false') or replaced by a call to “Abandon Module With Callback”, passing only the module name argument (if the bool is 'true').

* You may get errors about a skipped UFUNCTION, UPROPERTY etc. when upgrading.This is an indication that these elements are not reflected and so may be an indication of a bug (e.g. a skipped UPROPERTY which is a UObject pointer will not be tracked by the garbage collector).The usage should be reviewed and fixed, perhaps by removing the markup, moving the element outside of the skipped preprocessor block or some other form of refactoring.

### Editor and Tools

* Make sure to rebuild the proxy meshes for all clusters.

### Gameplay Framework

* All Tickable Game Objects should implement the virtual "Get Tickable Game Object World" function to indicate which World they should be ticked with, otherwise they will be ticked after all Worlds as part of the set of tickable game objects that do not belong to a world.

### Abilities System

* Converting existing float based gameplay attributes to use the FGameplayAttributeData struct is a two step process.First, resave any assets that contain gameplay attributes.Second, replace the float variables with FGameplayAttributeData, or a game specific struct derived from it, in your code.

### Online

* Online Subsystem modules have been moved to Plugins and must now be included in the plugins section of your project's uproject file and must no longer be referenced via "DynamicallyLoadedModuleNames" in your project's Build.cs files.Game projects can continue to reference Online Subsystem classes as before.Any custom modifications made in Engine that reference Online Subsystem must be routed through the Online Engine Interface.

#### Windows

* The Applocal Prerequisites Directory setting should be set to a base directory that contains files the binary files.

    * The Applocal Prerequisites Directory can be specified as an absolute path or relative to the engine or project directory using the variables $(EngineDir) and $(ProjectDir).

    * Files should be laid out within the Applocal Prerequisites Directory in the format <platform>\<package>\*.dll, where:

        * <platform> is the specific target platform (i.e. Win32 or Win64).

        * <package> is a unique package name (i.e. UCRT or Microsoft.VC140.CRT).

### Rendering

* The bounding box of a Static Mesh instance no longer includes its simple collision geometry.Now, the bounding box only includes renderable geometry.

* Any user-created vertex factory that implements the Get Static Batch Element Visibility function will need to set "Requires Per Element Visibility" on its Mesh Batch.

#### Optimizations

* The console command "r.Tonemapper.ScreenPercentage" has been renamed to “r.Tonemapper.MergeWithUpscale.Mode”, and offers additional modes (see the main release notes or cvar help for more information).

#### Mobile Rendering

* Mobile depth of field now requires Depth Of Field Method to be Gaussian.Other options will result in depth of field being disabled.
