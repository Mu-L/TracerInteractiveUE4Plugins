## 主要特性 

### 新增特性：体积雾

使用新增的体积雾功能在环境中创建不可思议的氛围！由于支持多种不同的密度，因此可以模拟尘土或烟雾流动于光束之间的效果，任何数量的光束都会影响体积雾。

![image alt text](image_0.png)(w:929 convert:false)

![image alt text](image_1.png)(w:928 convert:false)

![image alt text](image_2.png)(w:928 convert:false)

体积雾支持以下类型的光照：

* 单向光，通过级联阴影贴图实现阴影，或者通过光函数实现静态阴影。

* 任意数量的点和点光源，并伴有动态或静态阴影（如果启用了“投射体积阴影”） 

* 单一天空光，利用启用的“距离场环境光遮蔽”实现阴影

* 粒子光照（如果“体积散射强度”大于0） 

您可以使用对粒子系统应用的材质，通过新增的“体积范围”设置来控制体积雾。具有体积材质的单一粒子会导致向体积雾添加一个球体的密度。这完全是 3D 效果，毫不吹嘘。多个球形雾状粒子结合材质干扰可以将雾的效果限制在特定范围。

有关设置体积雾的信息，请参阅[本文档](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/VolumetricFog)。

### 新增特性：基于图像的 (FFT) 高光卷积 

使用新增的基于图像的 (FFT) 卷积功能创建真实的高光后处理效果！虚幻引擎 4.16 交付了 FFT Bloom，让美工能够利用自定义的高光内核形状，完全自主掌控强度以达到自己想象的结果。

![image alt text](image_3.png)(w:928 convert:false)

通过结合使用原始图像的数学卷积和内核图像，这种高光技术可以产生连续反应，例如星爆效果、扩散发光区域。这种基于图像的卷积之所以能产生额外的真实感，是因为它能够使用视觉上很有趣的非对称内核图像。它通常看起来像是有射线条纹的星爆效果，但可以包含睫毛轮廓、散景或者其他失真效果。 

**注：** 基于图像的卷积 Bloom 是为了在电影艺术或高端硬件中使用而设计的，而预置（标准）Bloom 应该用于大多数游戏应用。

### 新增特性：距离场照明优化

在最新一代游戏机和中等规格的 PC 上，**距离场环境光遮蔽** 和 **光线跟踪距离场阴影** 现在速度已经 **提高了 30-50%**！这两个功能使您能够在场景中的动态网格上实现更加真实的环境照明和区域阴影。

![image alt text](image_4.png)(w:929 convert:false)

此外，静态网格 **距离场生成速度也提高为原来的 2.5 倍**，这得得益于 Intel 的 Embree 光线跟踪库的加速。启用了八位网格距离场和压缩网格距离场项目设置时，内存用量也明显降低。

### 新增特性：轻量级刚体仿真

利用新增的 **轻量级刚体角色仿真** 创建大量逼真角色！您现在可以使用新增的高性能 **即时模式** PhysX API 在动画蓝图中模拟物理资产。使用这种仿真的角色也可以与世界中的静态几何体产生碰撞。

### 新增特性：VR 模式 UI 和交互更新

虚幻编辑器中的 VR 模式已彻底改造，现在提供更直观的工作流和编辑体验！

![image alt text](image_8.jpg)(w:722 convert:false)

一方面，新型的非对称控制器设置增添了一个改进的新型辐射式菜单，另一方面增添了精度提高的交互激光器，让用户能够快速轻松地处理关卡中的对象。

所有 VR 模式操作，包括所有主要的编辑器功能和 UI 面板，现在都可以从更新后的辐射式菜单进行访问。传送系统也进行了更新，现在可以瞬间移动到某个位置，将大小恢复为默认规模，以玩家的视角进行查看。有关更多信息，请参阅 [https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Editor/VR/GDC2017/](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Editor/VR/GDC2017/)

### 新增特性：在 VR 中编辑序列

Sequencer 过场动画编辑器现在可以在 VR 中使用了！用户现在可以创建新的序列，在关卡中四处移动对象，并且在这个过程中自动为转换创建序列键。通过拉动时间轴和设置这些键，可以创建过场动画序列和回放，这一切都是可以在 VR 中操作。还可以从 Sequencer UI 或辐射式菜单打开现有的关卡序列并进行回放。

* 新增特性！可调整的键使您能够真实地调整世界中的轨迹！

* 辐射式菜单中的“拉动时间轴”选项可以前后播放序列的速度获取控制棒或触控板输入。再次按扳机可以退出拉动时间轴模式。

### 新增特性：VR 模式下的物理仿真

现在可以使用运动控制器与物体交互，**在 VR 模式下模拟物理 Actor**！放置 Actor 装置来模拟物理效果，让物理仿真自己运行以获得真实的散落效果，或者使用运动控制器让 Actor 四处闲逛。

[/OBJECT]

此功能当前仅在 VR 模式下可用，但我们会在将来的版本中添加对桌面编辑的支持。

### 新增特性：Xbox One 渲染器 DirectX 12

**DirectX 12 现在是 Xbox One 的默认渲染器！** 我们在 DirectX 12 中进行了一系列稳定性和性能改进。这样就可以将其作为默认的 RHI，为针对 Xbox One 开发的游戏带来 **CPU 和 GPU 性能改进**。

![image alt text](image_12.png)(w:556 convert:false)

#### 切换回到 D3D11

需要切换回到 D3D11 的游戏将需要做如下设置：

1. 修改游戏 defaultengine.ini 中的 bBuildForD3D12

2. 针对 Xbox One 重新构建游戏

3. 重新烘焙内容

**注：** 在将来的版本中将弃用 D3D11 RHI。 

### 新增特性：对 WebAssembly 和 WebGL 2 的 HTML5 支持

虚幻引擎 4 现在支持 HTML5 全新的 WebAssembly 标准（也称为 WASM），这是最快最有效的编译和运行网络 C++ 的方法！我们目前使用的是 Mozilla 最新的 Emscripten 工具链 (v1.37.9)。这是一种新技术，并非在所有浏览器中都受到支持，因此将其视为抢先体验功能，需要 GitHub 访问权。

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_13.png)(w:929 convert:false)
[/REGION]

WASM 是一种适用网络应用的新型 JavaScript 代码转二进制格式，能够减小应用下载大小，缩短启动时间，降低内存消耗，提供明显的性能提升。有关 WASM 和浏览器支持的更多详细信息，请前往 [http://webassembly.org/](http://webassembly.org/)

UE 4.16 还添加了对 WebGL 2.0 的支持，该支持基于 OpenGL ES 3.0，提供了更杰出的渲染性能，提高了视觉保真度，并支持更多渲染功能，包括：

* UE4 高端移动特性级别的大多数功能

* 粒子和植物叶子的实例化几何绘图

* 支持多个渲染目标 (MRT)

* 纹理特性，例如，3D 或体积纹理、2D 数组纹理，不再存在非二次幂纹理限制

WASM 和 WebGL 2.0 受 Firefox 52 和 Chrome 57 或更高版本支持（推荐使用 64 位）。请注意，Windows 系统 Chrome 58 中似乎存在一个 bug，有时会导致内存不足错误。我们正在与 Google 通力协作来解决这一问题。请参阅 [UE-44727](https://issues.unrealengine.com/issue/UE-44727) 以了解有关该问题的最新状态。

您可以在 HTML5 项目设置的 Emscripten 部分中启用 WASM 和 WebGL 2.0。如果需要最广的浏览器支持，请继续使用 ASM.js 和 WebGL 1。*在即将发布的引擎中将放弃对 ASM.js 和 WebGL 1 的支持，之后会将其删除（确切时间取决于其他浏览器支持）。*

请观看在线演示：[试着用 HTML5 制作禅意花园](https://hacks.mozilla.org/2017/03/firefox-52-introducing-web-assembly-css-grid-and-the-grid-inspector/)，用自己的 Firefox 或 Chrome 浏览器（上述所列的受支持版本）抢先体验这些好处。

### 新增特性：垃圾回收速度翻倍

垃圾回收性能已经明显改善，现在 **速度是原来的两倍！** 具体的改进包括：

* 可访问性分析多线程已重新设计，现在能够降低任务管理的开销。

* 垃圾回收集群现在支持蓝图生成的类和所选 Actor 类型。 

* Uobject 非散列代码已经优化，缩短了销毁 Actor 所用的时间。

### 新增特性：运动身体与仿真本体

现在用户能够使用运动身体与仿真本体。现在可以使用完全由动画数据驱动的子骨骼，例如角色的手，而这些骨骼的本体也可以由物理仿真数据驱动。

这样就可以实现很酷的效果，例如，当有滚落的石头朝着玩家身体冲过来的时候，玩家做出攀岩响应。

### 新增特性：平台 SDK 升级

在每一个版本中，我们都会更新引擎以支持平台伙伴的最新 SDK 版本。

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_15.jpg)(w:929 convert:false)
[/REGION]

* **Visual Studio：** 要点：在本版本中，Windows 上不再支持 Visual Studio 2013。请升级到 Visual Studio 2015 或 Visual Studio 2017。

* **任天堂 Switch：** 支持任天堂 SDK 1.3.1

* **Xbox One：** 根据 2016 年 10 月 QFE3 XDK 构建

* **PlayStation 4：** 已升级到 PSR SDK 4.508.001 SDK

* **安卓：** 已更新 CodeWorks for Android 1R6u1

* **GoogleVR：** 已将插件更新到 V1.3

* **GoogleVR：** SDK 已更新到 1.40.0

* **GoogleVR：** 默认模式更改为 Daydream 和 Cardboard

* **Vulkan：** 将可分发文件和语言处理更新到 SDK 1.0.39.1

### 新增特性：Sequencer 镜头轨道增强

Sequencer 中的镜头轨道在过场动画和影片创建方面进行了一些改进！

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]

	[/PARAMLITERAL]
	[PARAMLITERAL:type]
	simple
	[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]

* **基于镜头的等级偏差：** 在默认情况下，关卡序列层次结构中较低级别的轨道具有优先权。这让电影制作人能够构建一个自己惯用的管道，镜头调整将覆盖镜头所在序列中的轨道。

* **针对所有轨道公开“完成时”属性：** 这让用户能够指定在序列完成时，轨道是应该将值恢复为制作动画之前的状态，还是保持不变。在电影制作环境中，通常需要镜头中的动画值恢复为制作动画之前的状态，这样就不会渗入到下一个镜头。在过场动画中，可能需要值一致保持下去，这样就可以从 Sequencer 动画状态直接进入到游戏中。  

* **预卷/后卷：** 预卷和后卷现在是所有轨道的笼统概念。某些轨道具有特定的行为，例如，镜头切换轨道会在预卷评估期间通知流系统下一个将要出现的镜头切换位置。

### 新增特性：Sequencer 中的材质参数集合动画

用户现在可以在 Sequencer 中对材质参数集合制作动画，这样就可以全面的把控动画标量和矢量参数，从而在任意数量的材质中引用这些参数。无需再针对每个材质实例对各个参数值制作动画来共享动画。

### 新增特性：改进了 UI 渲染性能

使用失效面板的游戏现在可以选择仅缓存小部件元素，而不是渲染数据，这样就能够体会到大幅改进的纹理批处理的好处，并且能够显著减少绘图调用。结果是在移动设备上显著提高性能！

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_18.gif)(w:456)
[/REGION]


在《战争机器》英雄选择 UI（上图）上，每个应用的逻辑元素都可以缓存，但也可以进行批处理。游戏机变量 Slate.CacheRenderData=0 可以启用这种模式，现在在移动设备上这是默认模式。

### 新增特性：改进了动画姿势驱动程序

我们对姿势驱动程序功能进行了许多改进，使用户能够以程序方式，比较一组骨骼和另一组参考“目标”的姿势，驱动混合形状或骨骼。这在某些部位尤其有用，比如在肩膀位置，可能需要根据上臂和肩膀的姿势来激活校正变形目标。

* 可以指定“自定义曲线”来表示应如何激活每个目标

* 可以选择直接驱动曲线（变形、材质），而不需要姿势资产

* UI 已改进为允许创建/编辑目标姿势，用于显示目标激活的条形等等

* 现在可以单击视口中的目标位置以将其选中

### 新增特性：材质扁平化的不透明和不透明蒙版

我们添加了对使用 Actor 合并工具或分层 LOD 系统时 **烘焙掉不透明（蒙版）值** 的支持。产生的（实例化）材质使用配置好的混合模式，确保它采用正确的渲染路径。以下是烘焙掉蒙版材质的示例：

![image alt text](image_20.png)(w:904 convert:false)

### 新增特性：改进了网格绘图工具

网格绘图系统进行了大幅改造，改进了易用性，现在更加清晰明朗，允许在编辑器的其他部分复用此功能。

动画蓝图功能库中提供了一组用于访问特定动画数据的一组新功能。访问和应用动画修改器可以通过骨骼编辑器和动画编辑器中的一个新选项卡来执行。动画修改器可以添加到骨骼或动画序列。对于动画序列，动画修改器仅应用到序列本身。当应用于骨骼时，它应用于基于该骨骼的所有动画序列。

### 新增特性：安卓虚拟键盘（抢先体验预览）

安装现在支持使用操作系统的虚拟键盘来取代弹出的对话框输入框！

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_31.gif)(w:256)
[/REGION]


要启用虚拟键盘，可选中 **项目设置 > 平台 > 安卓 > APK 打包** 下的复选框。该选项启用对虚拟键盘的基本支持，但输入元素是否可见，而不会被虚拟键盘遮挡，则使用提供的 OnVirtualKeyboardShown 和 OnVirtualKeyboardHidden 事件处理程序由应用程序自行保证。

**注：** 如果用户使用的语言要求使用 IME，那么可能需要使用 Android.NewKeyboard 控制台变量禁用虚拟键盘。

### 支持安卓运行时权限

虚幻引擎 4 现在支持安卓 23 及更高版本要求的运行时权限，以访问需要 Google 归类为危险的权限的功能。这包括访问联系人、照片、电话状态、外部存储、照相机和定位服务。请参阅以下网页以了解详细信息：[https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/requesting.html](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/permissions/requesting.html).

如果目标系统是安卓 23，那么安卓运行时权限插件现在能够在运行时通过原生代码进行检查，或者如果已经授予了权限，可以使用 **检查安卓权限** 蓝图节点进行检查。如果尚未授予权限，应用可能会使用 **请求安卓权限** 蓝图节点向用户申请该权限，然后使用绑定到 **授予权限时的动态委托** 的事件获取结果。这样就可以在游戏要求使用需要权限的功能之前授予权限，从而改善用户体验。如果目标系统是安卓 23 之前的版本，可以照常在 Android Manifest 中指定权限来授予权限。

![image alt text](image_32.png)(w:718 convert:false)

**注：** 4.16 要求安装安卓 SDK 23 或更高版本。如果还没有安装该级别的 SDK，可以在 Engine/Extras/AndroidWorks 目录中找到 CodeWorksforAndroid-1R6u1 安装程序。此外，在“项目设置”下的 Android SDK，请将安卓 SDK API 级别从 matchndk 更改为 latest。这样可以确保 UE4 使用在安卓 SDK 平台目录中找到的最新安装的 SDK。无需更改 NDK API 级别，android-19 是允许在 Lollipop（安卓 5.0）之前的安卓版本上安装 APK 的正确级别，如果设置为更高的级别会导致应用要求使用安卓 5.0+。

### 用于减小包大小的着色器代码库

现在可以使用 **共享材质着色器代码** 项目设置为所有着色器代码启用共享存储位置，这样就会为产生相同着色器代码的材质或材质实例存储单一副本。

某些平台（例如 iOS、TVOS 和 MacOS 上的 Metal）支持更高效的特定于平台的着色器库。启用 **共享材质原生库** 项目设置，可以利用这种原生库格式，从而进一步减小包大小。

### 新增特性：从 FBX 导入关节囊碰撞

现在可以从 FBX 文件导入关节囊简单碰撞，方法就像导入箱子、球体和凸面简单碰撞一样。现在可以在关节囊多边形网格上使用“UCP”前缀，导入时会将其删除，替换为对应的关节囊碰撞形状。

### 新增特性：共享与本地资产查看器配置文件的选项独立开来

虚幻编辑器现在支持在共享或本地级别存储资产查看器配置文件，使团队能够轻松地使用一组共享配置文件作为统一场景来评估美工资产。在本地级别存储配置文件能够确保用户仍可以使用一组自己想要在本地使用、但团队不需要的自定义配置文件。共享配置文件存储在 *DefaultEditor.ini* 中，要求用户检出或者将其设置为可写入才能使用。 

### 新增特性：改进了动画预览场景

我们对动画工具的预览场景进行了若干改进：

* 预览场景设置已经移到了现有设置选项卡，而不是位于视口的隐藏菜单中。该设置选项卡现在默认为显示状态。

* 主工具栏中添加了快速切换预览网格的快捷方式。适用于所有动画编辑器。

* 在添加预览场景时，无需再为了预览额外网格而创建“预览场景集合”资产。现在如果对网格设置感到满意，可以选择将其保存到资产。

### 新增特性：向动画查看器添加了默认摄像机选项

现在可以保存骨骼网格的“默认摄像机”位置。这适用于打开网格的情况，也可以通过按 Shift+F 来直接进行保存。

### 新增特性：播放蒙太奇蓝图节点

**播放蒙太奇** 是一个新增的异步节点，可以在任何蓝图逻辑中用于播放动画蒙太奇。它方便用户访问某些回调事件，让用户能够在蒙太奇混出、中断等情况下触发其他节点

![image alt text](image_33.png)(w:376 convert:false)

* 当蒙太奇完成播放并完全混出时，调用 OnCompleted。

* 当由于自动或手动停止导致蒙太奇开始混出时，调用 OnBlendOut。

* 当由于被另一个蒙太奇播放而中断导致蒙太奇开始混出时，调用 OnInterrupted。

* 当使用蒙太奇资产中的“播放蒙太奇通知”或“播放蒙太奇通知窗口”动画通知时，调用 OnNotifyBegin 和 OnNotifyEnd。这些动画通知可以携带额外的“通知名称”以区分来自同一蒙太奇的不同回调。

### 新增特性：为重定位姿势添加了选项

现在可以从姿势资产导入要在设置重定位基本姿势时使用的姿势。原来用于修改和保存当前姿势（使用当前姿势）和将骨骼转换重置为参考姿势（重置）的选项仍然可用。 

**注：** 您可以在动画编辑器中创建姿势资产，并以指定的名称在姿势资产中插入任何姿势。 

### 新增特性：静态网格编辑器中的静态视图选项

静态网格编辑器工具中现在提供了一些独立的选项，用于查看静态网格的简单和复杂碰撞。

### 新增特性：LOD 中的烘焙姿势

虚幻引擎 4 现在支持使用一个新的缩减设置“烘焙姿势”在 LOD 级别中烘焙姿势。这可以设置为单帧动画序列，以应用到所产生的 LOD 网格。事实证明，在删除骨骼并仍想保留姿势时特别有用。

### 新增特性：Sequencer 用户界面改进

音频轨道缩略图现在可以通过内部（平滑）RMS 曲线呈现峰值样本。音频轨道现在也可以纵向调节大小！

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_35.gif)(w:929)
[/REGION]


其他 Sequencer UI 改进：

* Sequencer 控制的 Actor 现在输出到关卡中时能够正确地做好标记。

* 现在可以为事件轨道指定额外的事件接收方（即 Actor 蓝图）。

* 绑定改进。现在可以在蓝图中为关卡序列拖拽/放置/设置绑定。例如，可以在蓝图中衍生对象，并将其指定到现有轨道。

### 新增特性：移动 VR 渲染改进

现在对三星 Gear VR 支持直接多视图，当使用移动多视图时，删除了额外的渲染目标和全屏复制，改进了总体性能，降低了内存用量。

在 Gear VR 上启用了多视图后，可以使用平面远场，确保以最佳效果呈现场景的立体渲染部分。

Google Daydream 支持标准移动多视图，将来版本中将提供直接支持。

### 新增特性：PlayStation VR 的社交屏幕（抢先体验预览）

PSVR 社交屏幕预览提供了对社交屏幕独立模式的支持，即显示器和 HMD 显示屏是不相同的。

该预览支持 30fps 的社交屏幕输出，还支持切换几种不同的输出模式。实现了以下样本模式：

* SystemMirror（这是始终存在的默认镜像模式）。

* SeparateTest（仅在社交屏幕上进行黑白切换）。

* SeparateTexture（显示蓝图指定的纹理，例如，场景捕获组件写入的渲染目标）。

* SeparateMirror（显示完整的 VR 渲染缓冲）

将来的工作包括优化、针对这些功能的多平台接口、可能支持 60fps 模式（这要求系统对话框解决与某些系统功能的冲突）。

新的 PSVR 项目设置 bEnableSocialScreenSeparateMode 必须设置为 true 才能使用此功能。当此设置为 true 时，会为社交屏幕分配额外的屏幕缓冲。搜索“SocialScreen”可以找到用于控制此功能的蓝图功能。

### 新增特性：安卓可执行文件大小降低

我们对编译器和链接器设置进行了一系列优化，减小了安卓二进制可执行文件的大小。选中 **以隐藏符号可见性进行构建** 选项后，在生成安卓可执行文件时，链接器会更加积极地从虚幻引擎中删除不使用的代码。这样也会从符号表中分离出功能符号，从而进一步减小可执行文件的大小。预计最终 APK 会减小大约 7MB。

**注：** 该选项会从设备上的二进制文件中删除一些符号，因此 logcat 输出中会显示一些没有任何符号的本机冲突调用堆栈。为了帮助排除故障，构建系统也会将含有除错符号的未分割二进制文件复制到输出目录，同时生成一个批处理文件以将这些符号添加到调用堆栈。

### 新增特性：顶点插值器材质表达式节点

在材质图形中添加了顶点插值器节点，现在用户可以更好地控制顶点和像素画之间的插值。添加这些节点是为了改进工作流，因此插值器限制并没有变化，着色器也未进行更改。

用于将工作转移到顶点着色器的现有工作流利用自定义 UV 输出。这样可能有点麻烦，而且还要手动打包数据。以下材质示例将预先经过皮肤处理的网格数据打包，然后再解包以在某种效果中使用：

![image alt text](image_36.png)(w:766 convert:false)

新的插值器节点会自动处理打包，因此能够简化并插入图形：

![image alt text](image_37.png)(w:776 convert:false)

之前通过自定义 UV 打包的工作现在会链接到 VS（顶点着色器）引脚，然后从 PS（像素着色器）引脚检索。

材质统计输出已更新为显示最新的插值器用量，包括目前已打包和可用的最大值。请注意以上示例中指令的计数方式，而且插值器用量保持不变。统计显示 TexCoord[0] 节点保留了 2 个标量，其余 6 个由预先经过皮肤处理的数据保留，因此在 2 个矢量中总共打包了 8 个标量。

该功能与自定义 UV 兼容，并且会将结果打包在一起。

### 新增特性：资产管理框架（抢先体验预览）

资产管理器是一个新增的全局对象，用于在编辑器中或在运行时发现、加载和审计地图以及特定于游戏的资产类型。它提供了一个框架，便于用户创建类似任务、武器或英雄之类的内容，并按需装入。现在仍在开发中，这些功能还没有准备就绪，不适用于只使用蓝图开发的游戏或者经验不足的开发人员，预计将于 4.17 正式推出。项目设置中的资产管理器选项卡可以用于建立游戏的规则：  

在运行时，可以查询资产管理器扫描的主资产类型，然后再进行加载，之后就可以根据需要异步加载。此外，在打包和发布游戏时，资产管理器设置也可以用于建立烘焙和分块规则。AnswerHub 上提供了有关此功能的仍在编写的文档：[https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/595580/what-is-the-asset-manager.html](https://answers.unrealengine.com/questions/595580/what-is-the-asset-manager.html)

### 新增特性：资产审计窗口（抢先体验预览）

资产审计窗口是基于资产管理框架构建的，可以一次性审计大量资产的磁盘大小、内存用量和一般资产属性。这是内容浏览器的专用版本，可以从 **窗口 > 开发人员工具** 菜单进行访问，也可以通过内容浏览器或参考查看器中的右键单击菜单访问。打开窗口后，可以使用各个按钮添加资产，在烘焙资产注册表之外装入的平台数据可以使用平台下拉菜单进行加载。以下是从 PS4 上的射击游戏样本中截取的审计纹理示例：

![image alt text](image_38.png)(w:929 convert:false)

### VR：VR 的统一游戏机命令

我们整合并统一了各个 VR 平台的游戏机命令，创建了一个共享层供开发人员使用，而不必单独维护每一种平台。

这样有以下好处：

* 启动新平台更加简单。

* 各个 HMD 的参数含义更加一致。

* 当前 HMD 实现的冗余减少。

* 所有 VR 相关的游戏机命令使用通用的前缀“vr.”。在命令名中清晰地标记了特定于供应商的扩展名。

* 更新后的游戏机命令支持补全和内联用法帮助文本。

在过渡期间，仍能够识别旧版游戏机命令，但使用时会发出不推荐使用的警告。

### 自定义硬件指针

现在 Windows、Mac 和 Linux 上支持平台原生自定义硬件指针！您可以设置硬件指针以在项目的用户界面设置中使用。

系统允许用户为指针提供多种格式。例如，您可以在设置中指定使用“Slate/FancyPointer”作为默认指针。在游戏内容文件夹的 Slate 目录中，会有 FancyPointer.png + .cur + tiff，用于包含某些平台的多分辨率解析功能。Mac 上将装入 tiff，Windows 上使用 cur/ani 文件，如果没有找到我们支持的特定于某一平台的格式，将查找 png。

### 快速创建小部件

UMG 小部件创建速度现在提高为三倍！在烘焙时，小部件编译器现在会生成小部件模板/原型，与所生成的蓝图类存储在同一个包中，并在小部件创建期间使用。 

**技术细节**

在编译期间，我们生成了一个几乎完全初始化的小部件树，包含所有子用户小部件及其树，连接了所有成员变量，初始化了指定槽，设置任何动画等等。这个几乎完全构造的小部件可以进行实例化以用作原型，但不一定要使用对应的慢速 StaticDuplicateObject 路径。 

这种方法存在一些限制，如果用户忘记在子对象属性上设置“已实例化”，小部件的部分编译步骤现在会检验实例化是否成功，实例化之后是否存在 GLEO 引用。幸运的是，这种情况应该少之又少，因为所有的 UVisuals（小部件和槽）现在都是 DefaultToInstanced，这样就解决了一些不可避免的要求有已实例化标志的情况。尤其是在原生代码中使用 BindWidget 的很多情况。

## Release Notes

### AI

* New: Added a profiler for Environment Query System (EQS) that can be accessed through the tabs of the EQS Editor.

    * It collects data automatically during game sessions as long as UES_EQS_DEBUGGER define is set. This includes options for average and max execution time of each step (including breakdown of composite generators), number of items processed by each step, and average frequency of running, which can be useful to identify how often fail safes are actually running. 

    * It collects tick load data when USE_EQS_TICKLOADDATA define is set. Each query can store up to 16384 records in cyclic buffer (~4.5 minutes at 60 FPS) showing percentage of EQS tick spent on processing it. This is displayed on the graph in EQS editor tab.

    * A console command has been added, "DumpEnvQueryStats", that saves current EQS profiler data to a file (project's Logs folder, .ue4eqs extension), which can be later loaded and inspected in the EQS Editor.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Blackboard Key Selector's "Init Selector" that resulted in it picking the first value from the Blackboard rather than the appropriately typed one.

* Bugfix: Gameplay Task Resource's Auto Resource ID initialization is no longer cleared during Hot Reload.

* The "Get AI Controller" is now a pure Blueprint Function.

* Exposed Brain Component's "Is Running" and â€œIs Pausedâ€ functions to Blueprint.

* Clamped AI Sight's peripheral vision angle as well as changed the UI to not allow values outside of the 0-180 range.

* Disabled collision on Nav Modifier Volumes. Previously they had an 'Overlap All' response and generated overlap events. They are only supposed to be used for preventing navmesh generation, but overlap events could affect gameplay and are also bad for performance. 

* Made "Skip Agent Height Check When Picking Nav Data" option ignore height when picking nav data for agents. It now picks solely based on the radius when this is enabled. 

#### Behavior Tree

* Bugfix: Added safeguards to prevent crashes resulted from Blackboard keys being names being longer than 1024 characters.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue in dynamic Behavior Tree injection that was causing unexpected behavior when the main BT had more BT injection points. 

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue in Blackboard key instantiation that resulted in the instanced key never being used and BB operations always referring to the original BB entry.

### Debugging Tools

* The Gameplay Debugger's input detection has been adjusted so that Tap and Hold work correctly in fixed timestep mode. 

### Navigation

* Added a flag to Recast Navmesh, "Allow Nav Link As Path End", that is used to control whether path corridors can end on a navigation link or not. This may happen with partial paths and not usually desired behavior. Navigation links at the end are not allowed by default. 

* The Blueprint functions "Project Point To Navigation", â€œGet Random Reachable Point In Radiusâ€, and â€œGet Random Point In Navigable Radiusâ€ all return booleans determining if the projection/generation was successful, as well as the vector value that describes the requested point.

* Bugfix: Fixed a memory leak in navmesh generators.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue that resulted in losing user settings in Static Mesh's navigation export (Nav Collision object) after changing any property of the Static Mesh.

* Bugfix: Hand-placed AI pawns now get their Path Following Component's "My Nav Dataâ€ variable set properly.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with missing update of navigation area after duplicate or undo operations on Nav Link Proxy and Nav Link Component.

* Bugfix: Corrected the handling of path following requests by Floating Pawn Movement.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with parameters of geometry trace handling drop-down navigation links. All components blocking on ECC_WorldStatic channel will now report a valid hit.

* BugFix: HLOD's navigation collision exporting no longer causes unnecessary log output about NavCollision instances in cooked builds.

#### Animation

* New: You can now rename Virtual Bones.

* New: You can now change Virtual Bones so that you can have a Virtual Bone that is a child of another Virtual Bone.

* New: Added "Get Body Target Transform" to the Physical Animation component, which will return the goal transform that a particular body is trying to get to.

* New: Control rig Sequences can now be exported to Anim Sequences.

* New: Preview Scene settings have been exposed in the existing settings tab rather than in a hidden menu of the viewport.

* New: Support for "Curve Source" nodes to find source components on other Actors. It now searches for the property name rather than the component name.

* New: Added "Set Preview Mesh" to the toolbar for all animation related Editors.

* New: Updated Alembic Third-party libraries to the latest versions.

* New: Added functionality to try and match in-engine Material asset names to FaceSet names found inside of an Alembic cache to automatically assign the correct Materials.

* New: The Alembic Importer now supports Vertex Color data.

* New: Added functionality to inform about changes to source data when reimporting your animation data from FBX. It now checks for the following:

    * Whether or not the sequence length has changed.

    * Whether or not previously-imported curves exist in the source data.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when trying to implement a function in a child Anim Blueprint.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when debugging a null Animation Sequence.

* Bugfix: Trying to access a skinned vertex position on a mesh when using Master Pose component no longer crashes.

* Bugfix: Attempting to bind to Skeletal Mesh with Anim Blueprint already set no longer crashes.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash and effector selection issue for two-bone IK.

* Bugfix: Right-clicking the empty space in the asset shortcut drop-down no longer crashes.

* Bugfix: Removed an ensure (warning) by reverting to default unit vectors if zero-sized lookat/lookup vectors are specified for a "Look At" node.

* Bugfix: Removed a crash when clearing an animation of a 1D blendspace sample.

* Bugfix: Crash fix to import code for Alembic Caches with the HDF5 backend.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue when adjusting curves in the Anim Curves tab using a slider when they are not currently selected.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Update Rate Optimization update rate being too high. Now we use int, so if you have a high update rate it still can go until it wraps around.

* Bugfix: Child Anim Blueprints can now be retargeted.

* Bugfix: Fixed flipping transforms when mirrored.

* Bugfix: Post Process instances are now appropriately updated, even when the main Anim Instance is not using parallel update.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where running the Editor in a different culture could break pins on nodes that have optional arrays of pins (ie. Animation Graph nodes like Blend By Layer).

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Anim Class being set by name, causing duplicate-named Anim Blueprints to be incorrectly resolved.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where "r.SkeletalMeshLODBias" was affecting meshes in the Animation Editor viewports.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Animation Preview Scene keyboard binding (I and O hotkeys now hide and show scene elements regardless of tab opened state).

* Bugfix: Skinned Mesh LOD now updates in the editor under various physics-related circumstances.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with foot placement IK doing line traces on worker threads.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Anim Blueprints that contain State Machines having blank palettes.

* Bugfix: Renaming curves in animations now saves properly.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with two-bone IK flickering around full extension when stretch is enabled.

* Bugfix: Animation now works as expected for dynamically-bound wheeled-vehicle anim instances.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where you could not undo changes from Alembic Import settings.

* Bugfix: Fixed timing issues occurring while playing back Alembic caches.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with incorrect behavior occurring when placing more than three samples in a straight line for a 2D blendspace.

* Bugfix: Dropping a new Animation asset on an existing Sequence Player node can now be undone.

* Bugfix: Breaking transition node connections within Animation State Machines can now be undone.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue to ensure that changes to animation sync markers are propagated to currently open blendspace assets.

* Bugfix: Skeletal Mesh components tick properly when paused if "Tick Event When Paused" is enabled.

* Bugfix: Fixed Skeletal Mesh Merge duplicating Skeletal sockets.

* Enabled snapping for translation in the Animation viewports.

* Removed force inline from Virtual Compression functions.

* Removed the AnimGraph module from the Graph Editor as a dependency.

* Bone Reference now has improved performance by caching compact post bone index.

* Graph files have been moved to Animation Blueprint Editor.

* We have stopped saving raw curve data into animations on cook in order to save memory and disk space.

* Ticks now appear properly on Anim Sequence scrub bar.

* Persona now depends publicly on Skeletal Editor.

* Montages are now correctly initialized when created. They can be used straight away without first opening them in the Montage Editor.

* We now propagate thread safety flags to child Animation Blueprints.

* The Anim Notify Blueprints now start with a "received notify" event node.

* Made single-node animation instances request clothing simulation resets when their animation is changed. This is because the new animation could be very different from the outgoing animation, and this might cause pops.

* Refactored "Evaluate Bone Transforms" to prevent usage of Skeletal Mesh component.

    * Deprecated "Evaluate Bone Transforms" in favor of new â€œ'EvaluateSkeletalControl_AnyThreadâ€.

    * Deprecated Skeletal Mesh component argument to "Convert CS Transform To Bone Space" and â€œâ€‹Convert Bone Space Transform To CSâ€. Now they just take a transform.

* When selecting bones that are non-required, we now do not render gizmos or text labels.

* Skeletal selection does not lag behind choice made in the viewport (i.e. when showing bone weights).

* Added accessor and modifier functions for "Start Time Offset" value in Geometry Cache components.

##### Animation Assets

* New: You can now choose a preview slot in the Montage Editor.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when reimporting animations with additive transform tracks.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with additive Pose Asset preview being applied twice.

* Bugfix: Compressed animation data is now included in Memory Stats for Animation Sequences.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where blendspace interpolation settings would not have a direct effect and required reopening the blendspace asset.

##### Animation Blueprint

* New: Added "Spline IK" node.

* New: Added a property to Blendspace Player nodes that enables users to choose whether the play time is reset when the blendspace changes.

* New: Animation Blueprints can now specify a Preview Mesh.

* New: Added the "Look At" node so you can use â€œLook at Locationâ€ on a socket or joint, and improved the Visualizer.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when "Pose Asset" contains a bone that is not in the mesh.

* Bugfix: Fixed an assertion that could occur when selecting certain items in the Animation Blueprint editor.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when diffing State Machine Transition graphs.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with "Pose Handler" using mesh bone index and not compact bone index for setting up â€œBone Blend Weightsâ€ array.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with incorrect errors on compiling Aim Offset nodes with exposed blendspace pins. 

* Bugfix. Fixed an issue with additive nodes breaking the current pose when they have no additive animation attached. 

* Bugfix: Fixed issues pertaining to extra references to Animation Blueprints on Skeletal Mesh components. 

* Layered Bone Blend node has been optimized so that it will cache mask weights in compile time. 

##### Import/Export

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when reimporting a Skeletal Mesh that has Virtual Bones.

##### Skeletal Mesh

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when using re-import button in the Skeletal Mesh Editor. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash related to Skeletal Mesh resources not being initialised before component is registered.

* Bugfix: Fixed a serialization mismatch in Skeletal Mesh source buffers.

* When importing a Skeletal Mesh, "Activate Bone Indices" now always includes parents even if it's not skinned. 

#### Tools

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash in Persona when rotating a bone due to single bone controllers not being initialized correctly. 

* Bugfix: Fixed an ensure when deselecting bones in Anim Blueprint editor.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where mesh-customized sockets were not showing up by default in 'Active' socket filter mode. 

* Bugfix: Fixed issues related to bone removal in Skeletal Mesh LODs.

    * Issue where the "Apply" button would not show after adding bone names. 

    * Issue where previously removed bones would not be restored. 

    * Ensure that the Skeletal Tree is updated when bones are removed or restored. 

* Double-clicking animation assets in Content Browser will now try to re-use existing Animation Editor windows, rather than opening a new one every time.

* Animation picker on Skeletal Mesh component is now disabled rather than hidden when no Skeletal Mesh is assigned.

* The Soundwave-internal curve tables have been moved to the 'Advanced' rollout.

#### Audio

* New: Vorbis-encoded audio files can now be streamed. 

* New: Audio streaming is now supported on Android, iOS, and XBox One.

* Bugfix: Fixed a shutdown crash when there is a pending async audio occlusion trace.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when opening a Media Sound Wave.

* Bugfix: 'Sound Player' nodes will more efficiently load the referenced sound asset unless a 'Sound Quality' node is being used to select which 'Sound Player' nodes to consider, in which case, the current asset reference evaluation will continue to be used.

* Bugfix: We only queue subtitles once per-wave instances playback.

#### Automation

* New: Added support for -DeveloperReportOutputPath and -DeveloperReportUrl commands to permit local runs of the Automation Tool to generate reports on the report server and launch the browser to view them. 

* 'ResavePackages' commandlet now supports lighting in separate packages when using it to rebuild lighting.

* Option to disable taking screenshots has been disabled. Screenshot comparison is an integral part of the testing so disabling them is no longer allowed. 

* The system now waits for the asset registry to finish loading assets before running tests.

#### Blueprints

* New: Added the 'Remove Gameplay Tag' function to the gameplay tag function library. 

* New: Blueprints containing a String and Text variables can now be marked as multi-line, which enables values to contain newlines when pressing Shift + Enter while editing them. 

* New: Blueprint Variables can now be marked as 'Read-Only' in Blueprint Editor, which prevents them from being set in Blueprints. This behaves the same as using 'BlueprintReadOnly' instead of 'BlueprintReadWrite' on a C++ UPROPERTY() declaration. 

* New: 'Get Default Locale' has been exposed to Blueprints.

* Macro instances that contain latent actions will now show an overlay clock icon like other latent nodes, which makes them easier to spot and understand that they impact execution flow

	![image alt text](image_39.png)(w:720 convert:false)

* New: Improved comments in Blueprints.

    * Comment node text now wraps while the comment is being edited.

    * Reduced cases where the title of a comment node would clip at the end.

    * Editing the comment for a regular node using the right click menu will now show changes immediately, rather than waiting until the node was moused over again.

* New: Added the Save and Find in Content Browser buttons to the Level Script Blueprint editor (they will save/show the map package that contains the Level Script).

* New: Added the ability to search for delegate nodes using the function name that they are bound to. 

* New: 'Array Get' node.

    * Can toggle between returning a reference or copy.

    * Using a reference solves a longstanding issue with arrays of structs not being able to easily make changes to the items in the array.

* New: 'Get Class Defaults' node has been extended to include output pin exceptions for Set & Map variable defaults. Like array types, the returned value is now a copy of the default value rather than a reference to it. This is done in order to avoid an accidental mutation of the Blueprint class default object. 

* New: Function inputs are now exposed as variable "Get" nodes via the right-click context menu in a Blueprint function graph context.

    * To use: In a Blueprint Function graph, right-click to access the context menu. Any input parameters will be listed as additional "Get" actions.

    * In this way, input parameters can be accessed like local variables from anywhere in the function graph; in other words, it's no longer necessary to drag wires all the way back to the Function Entry node in order to access these values.

* New: We now support "value-based" Bitfield enum type associations in the editor for a UPROPERTY marked as 'Bitmask' with a 'BitmaskEnum' association.

    * Prior to this release, Bitfield properties did not work with associated enum types in which the enum values were explicitly set to a bitmask value (e.g. 0x80). That is, the value was assumed to always be set to the index of the bit that the flag should set in the editor ("index-based" mode).

    * To switch the associate to the new "value-based" mode, include an additional metadata key in the UENUM() declaration. Example: UENUM(Meta = (Bitmask, *UseEnumValuesAsMaskValuesInEditor="true"*)).

* New: Added a whitelist mechanism for handling native noexport types that can support direct field access in nativized Blueprint code.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash in Blueprint Editor when adding an input parameter to a Custom Event node after deleting a Function Graph containing a Create Event node. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when creating a new Blueprint class from one or more selected Actors in which the root component is not Blueprint-spawnable.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash on load in nativized EDL-enabled builds with non-nativized child Blueprint class assets. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a runtime Blueprint VM crash upon removing an element from set after consecutive add/remove iterations. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash that could occur when splitting a struct pin on a collapsed graph node. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when trying to use non-supported types as Blueprint map keys. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash that could occur when changing a Map's value type string to vector. Map variables are properly cleared when value type is changed to an incompatible type.

This fixes one cause of "Cannot open include file" errors when packaging with Blueprint Nativization enabled. 

* Nodes in the blueprint editor again use their custom cursor (grab hand when hovering over a node and crosshairs when hovering  over pins).

* 'Logarithm' node added to the Blueprint Math library.

* 'Set' pins on 'Intersection', 'Union' and 'Difference' nodes now infer their values uniformly.

* Out of date Class Default Objects are no longer duplicated when compiling a Blueprint, reducing blueprints compilation time

* Successive calls to Set Intersect, Union or Difference now provide correct results, previously the Set was not cleared before calculating the new result

* 'Trace By Profile' collision functions have been exposed to Blueprints. 

* Nativize code is now more precise about dependencies, reducing the resulting executable size and compiler load. 

* Blueprints that override an inheritable component are no longer 'data only'. Blueprints with overridden components but no extra functions now load without losing data.

* Blueprints that extend types that implement 'Needs Load For Server' or 'Needs Load For Client' now honor those functions, meaning they will not be cooked for targets that their type wants to be excluded from.

* Delegates in nativized packaged builds correctly prevent double registration.

* Blueprints used as a child actor class will no longer be marked dirty when compiling the class that references them.

* When duplicating a Blueprint component, that component will now be a sibling of the duplicated node, not a child of it unless it is the root node being duplicated.

* Duplicated root nodes will have their scale set to (1,1,1) to avoid applying the scale multiplier twice.

* Blueprintable Components are no longer considered experimental, they have been enabled by default for several versions.

* The ticking behavior of latent actions in components has been changed to match how they behave in actors.  When the component ticks, the latent actions will now be processed at the same time, rather than happening later in the frame when latent actions for non-ticking actors and components are processed.  This does change behavior, so there is a console variable (t.TickComponentLatentActionsWithTheComponent) that can be used to revert to the older behavior until affected component Blueprints that depended on the old ordering behavior can be fixed up. The cvar should be treated as deprecated; it will be removed in a future release.

* Updated Blueprint nativization so that it generates source files compatible with 'include what you use' (IWYU).

* Moved nativized Blueprint plugin generation to the project's 'Intermediate\Plugins' folder.

* Removed make/break nodes from the Blueprint menu for structs that aren't marked as a 'BlueprintType'.

* Updated marquee selection in graph editors. Ctrl dragging now inverts nodes' selection state, instead of only deselecting them (holding alt is now for pure deselection).

* The Actor Details view will now refresh property mappings for the current Actor instances selection after a bytecode-only recompile of its Blueprint class as a dependency during reinstancing. 

* Child Blueprint class assets are now marked as dirty if its parent Blueprint class incurs a structural change. This alerts the user that updates to the Child Blueprint would need to be saved on exit.

* We now emit C++ ctor initialization code for nested default subobjects when nativizing a Blueprint class at cook time.

* Instanced Static Mesh transform edits are now reflected in the Blueprint editor's preview scene.

* The editor will now raise an error at cook time after an attempt to nativize a Blueprint class that also implements a native C++ interface with a pure virtual function declaration that is not also marked up with UFUNCTION. This is because we cannot nativize a Blueprint class that does not also have an implementation of a pure virtual function inherited from the interface.

* C++ interfaces with one or more pure virtual function declarations not also tagged with UFUNCTION are now excluded from the list of available "Implementable" interfaces in the Blueprint class editor.

* Non-nativized child Blueprint classes will now properly override a nativized parent Blueprint class's component defaults at runtime in a nativized cooked build.

* We will now implicitly nativize any child Blueprint class that overrides one or more BlueprintCallable functions inherited from a parent Blueprint class that is also nativized.

* The Blueprint diff tool now reports when a component changes its type between revisions

* Blueprints are now only dirtied if edited properties are from objects in the Blueprint's package.

#### Core

* New: Support added for "double" and 'fname' stat types in UFE stat export to CSV.

* New: Pak files can now have their index encrypted with AES, preventing them from being opened by unrealpak.

    * An AES key must be provided in the project Encryption.ini, and then index encryption can be enabled in the project packaging settings in the editor.

	[REGION:note]
	When either pak index encryption or signing are enabled in the Project Settings, pak ini encryption must also be enabled in order to avoid a potential security issue. All of these settings can be found in the Packaging section of the Project Settings dialog in the editor.

* 'None' is now going to be properly considered by the engine as an invalid filename.

* The editor will now collect garbage after a map is loaded to make sure any stale components or other objects that are no longer needed are destroyed. This is to make sure that these components are not resurrected by another editor operations like duplication.

* Made sure the async log writer flushes the log archive even if there's no serialization requests to prevent situations where some of the recent requests haven't been flushed to disk

* New: You can now color-code all of the windows in the editor in order to visually distinguish them when working across multiple branches or projects

    * You can adjust the 'Editor Window Background Color' for a subtle effect, as the default background is already a pretty dark grey:

		![image alt text](image_40.jpg)(w:929 convert:false)

    * Or you can edit the tint in the two brushes (which sets the texture to a white default one) to get a very brazen effect:

		![image alt text](image_41.jpg)(w:929 convert:false)

* New: Added Data Table export/import support for TMap and TSet.

    * This will allow for NDA'd platforms to keep their ini settings in protected files, but still be editable by the editor. 

    * Moved project settings for console platforms over

    * See UObject::GetConfigOverridePlatform()

* New: Scene importing now allows for plugins to expose new scene import factory types.

* New: Overhauled "Call In Editor" support and promoted it so it can be used on functions in any class, not just Blueprints derived from AActor:

    * "Call In Editor" can now be used on native UFUNCTION() declarations (e.g., UFUNCTION(Category=CoolCommands, CallInEditor)).

    * Blueprint declared functions can also be marked as CallInEditor (in addition to custom events), which allows you to set the category and tooltip for the buttons.

    * Now shows each function as a separate button, placed in the category associated with the function.

    * Removed the duplicate copies of properties placed in the Blutility section.

    * Prevented operating on functions that have parameters or return values, which could crash before.

    * Added a scoped transaction around "Call In Editor" execution so changes made can be undone.

    * The button strip entry is now searchable by function name or tooltip.

* New: Added a new Details view option: "Show Hidden Properties while Playing"

    * Enabling this allows you to see every property on selected objects that belong to a simulating world, even non-visible and non-editable properties.

    * This feature is very useful for inspection and debugging, because you can see all of the internals of your Actors and Objects.

    * Be careful when changing values for properties that are not really intended to be changed at runtime.  You could introduce instability or even corrupt data.

    * Note that this setting is saved for your entire project.

    * Tracks can now be prioritized based on their subscene hierarchical bias value. Higher bias values take precedence. 

    * Fixed particle system restore state so that it gets the proper initial active state of the particle. 

    * Added a generic past menu for Master (root) tracks. 

    * Changed the time snapping interval in the toolbar UI so that it no longer additionally updates the Sequencer setting. The setting is only used to initialize the time snapping interval of the Level Sequence.

    * Added translate keys with Ctrl and Left-Right arrows. 

    * Added Level Sequence Actor button in the Details panel to open Sequencer.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue for outdated error message instructions for how to fix being unable to launch on an iOS device. 

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with "Save Current As" option not saving the current level and only saving the Persistent Level and then reloading everything thus causing work to be lost if editing a sub-level.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Material Instances being marked dirty when opening.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with TAssetSubClassOf properties being reset on undo.

* Import data and thumbnail data are now transactional. You can now undo and redo their edits.

* Reread in the target RHIs array every time the list of shader types is needed, instead of caching, because the user could change the settings in the editor, then click cook.

* New: The Player Controller's "Should Perform Full Ticket When Paused" can now be set from Blueprints and the Details panel. 

* New: Spawn Sound and Force Feedback Blueprint nodes now have a "Auto Destroy" pin that can be set to false to allow the component to be reused after the sound/pattern complete.

* New: The number of buttons that can be used by Raw Input is now 20.

* New: Fields of Attribute MetaData are now editable. 

* New: In the Ability System, the "Cancel Ability" has been exposed to Blueprints. 

* New: For Cameras, support has been added for specifying a default aspect ratio and whether or not to constrain to it in a Camera Manager subclass. 

    * Normally the information would come from a Camera component, but this is useful when using custom view logic that doesn't source from a Camera component as the view target. 

* New: Added "â€‹On Component Collision Settings Changed Event" delegate to Primitive Component. Fixed Skeletal Mesh Component not calling Super implementation for â€œOn Component Collision Settings Changedâ€.

* New: Refactored Character Movement Component determination of net send rate when combining moves into a virtual function Get Client Net Send Delta Time. Added configurable values to Game Network Manager under â€‹[/Script/Engine.GameNetworkManager] in BaseGame.ini: "ClientNetSendMoveDeltaTime", â€œClientNetSendMoveDeltaTimeâ€, â€œClientNetSendMoveThrottleAtNetSpeedâ€, â€œClientNetSendMoveThrottleOverPlayerCountâ€.

    * This replaces the values that were hardcoded in the network code for characters and enables easier configuration of client send rates for movement.

* New: We've increased Pawn location replication precision to 2 decimal places from 0. Prevents replicated pawns from being inside geometry by a large amount. Removed CVars controlling CharacterMovement proxy shrink amount and made those instanced properties on the component.

* New: Added a flag to Character Movement Component to determine whether or not character should Sweep while using "NavWalking", instead of relying on Generate Overlaps flag.

* New: Added "Apply Gravity While Jumping" flag to Character Movement Component. This helps to reduce Framerate Dependent Jump Height issues when disabled, but raises jump height. This is disabled by default.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash due to null World Settings when rendering a thumbnail. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when opening Blueprint after adding a component to native class referenced by a Child Actor Component. 

* Bugfix: Fixed several issues with renaming or deleting Gameplay Tags from the Gameplay Tag Project Settings page.

* Bugfix: Fixed issues with seamless travel in PIE and sub-levels shared between different Persistent Levels. 

* Bugfix: Fixed issues where Child Actor Component's "Parent Component" would be null on the client. 

* Bugfix: Fixed accumulated forces in Character Movement applied incorrectly when movement mode or active state changes.

    * Added â€‹"Clear Accumulated Forcesâ€

    * "Add Force" and related functions now avoid adding the force if in Movement Mode is set to "None". When ticking in "None", forces are cleared so they don't pile up until the next valid movement mode. Forces are also cleared if the updated component changes or when the capsule simulates physics.

    * "Deactivate" implemented to stop movement and call â€œClear Accumulated Forcesâ€.

    * "Clear Accumulated Forces" now also clears pending launch velocity. Exposed â€œClear Accumulated Forcesâ€ to Blueprints.

    * "Apply Accumulated Forces" does not call â€Clear Accumulated Forcesâ€, since that would prevent pending launch.

    * "Add Force" and â€œAdd Impulseâ€ now also check that character movement is active (not deactivated, able to tick).

    * "Simulate Movement" handles pending launch and clears forces regardless of whether it's simulated proxy.

    * Inlined Actor Component "Is Active" for performance.

* Bugfix: Fixed characters sliding when landing on slanted surfaces or stairs, when aggressive "Perch" settings could cause a line trace (from the center of a capsule) instead of capsule trace and thereby screw up the floor distance checks.

* Bugfix: Fixed the case of people moving a Character mesh in Begin Play rather than in the Editor or Construction Script and not having the mesh offset reflected correctly in network games.

    * Added function "Cache Initial Mesh Offset" to cache initial mesh offset, used as the target for network smoothing. This takes location and rotation params so you can be explicit on the values, in case you try to change these during network smoothing, where reading the relative offsets would be skewed.

    * Added a call to this function from Begin Play in addition to the existing call from "Post Initialize Components", and exposed this to Blueprints as well for custom changes to mesh offset at runtime.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with Projectile Movement Component continuing to simulate (and generate hit events) after it is deactivated during simulation. "Has Stopped Simulation" function now checks if â€œIs Activeâ€ is false.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with "Get Welded Bodies" so that it properly returns Skeletal Bodies, instead of the default body for Skeletal Mesh Components.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with infinite jump on client when Jump Max Hold Time is not 0.

* Stop dynamic force feedback when initiating Actor is destroyed.

* Clarified the tooltip on the "Inverse Lerp" function.

* In the Movement Component "Deactivate" calls â€œStop Movementâ€ to clear cached velocity. 

    * It was undesirable that reactivation many seconds or frames later would restore a stale velocity. 

* The "Collision.ListComponentWithResponseToProfile" command now includes pending kill objects. Use this to inspect collision responses between objects in a game world. 

* Optimized the Math Library "Get Forward Vector" (converts Rotator to forward direction). This way we avoid building a matrix, and avoids 1 more SinCos call.

#### Learning Resources

##### Sample Content

* New: ShooterGame now supports dedicated servers on PC, Mac, and Linux!

#### Localization

* New: Improvements to culture switching and LocRes files.

    * LocRes files now de-duplicate translations when they're generated, which can result in smaller LocRes files.

    * The localization compilation step now produces a LocMeta file, which contains meta-data specifying the native culture during compile, and where the native LocRes file can be found.

    * Changing cultures now loads the native localization data prior to loading the non-native translations to ensure that translations are always applied to a consistent base.

    * The "leet" culture (available when localization testing is enabled) is now always applied against the native translation, and correctly restores non-translated text when switching away from the "leet" culture.

    * "-culture=leet" now works correctly on the command line ("-leet" also works).

    * LoadLocalizationResourcesForCulture is no longer called multiple times during initialization of the text localization manager.

* New: Updated Fast Decimal Format to support the correct 0-9 numerals for the current locale

    * These are typically still Latin, but Middle Eastern languages have some variants.

    * This addresses an inconsistency between FText formatting of numbers and dates (since numbers always used Latin, but dates used the culture correct numerals).

* New: Split the monolithic culture concept in UE4

    * UE4 has historically only supported the concept of a single monolithic "culture" that applied to both text localization and internationalization, as well as all asset localization. Typically the "culture" was set to the "locale" of the OS, however that could be undesirable or incorrect on platforms (such as newer versions of Windows) that have a distinct concept of "language" (for localization) and "locale" (for internationalization).

    * This change splits the concept of "culture" into "language" and "locale", and also adds the concept of "asset groups". The language is now used to work out which localization we should use, and the locale is used to control how numbers/dates/times/etc are formatted within our internationalization library.

    * Asset groups expand on the language used by asset localization and allow you to create a group of asset classes that can be assigned a different culture than the main game language. A typical use-case of this would be creating an "audio" group that could, for example, be set to Japanese while the rest of the game runs in English.

    * If your game doesn't care about the distinction between language and locale, and doesn't need to use asset groups, then you're able to continue to use "culture" as you always have. If, however, you do care about those things, then you'll likely want to avoid using the "culture" directly (as it's now a very aggressive setting that overrides all others), and instead favor using language/locale (games will typically treat these as the same) and asset groups as separate concepts (both in settings, and in your in-game UI).

    * The language or locale for a game can be controlled by settings within the "Internationalization" section of your configs (this would typically be set in your Game User Settings config, in the same way that "culture" works), eg)

			[Internationalization]
			language=fr
			locale=fr

    * The asset groups for a game can be controlled by settings within the "Internationalization.AssetGroupClasses" and "Internationalization.AssetGroupCultures" sections of your configs (the asset group class definition would typically be set in your DefaultGame config, and the cultures the groups use would typically be set in your Game User Settings config), eg)

			[Internationalization.AssetGroupClasses]
			+Audio=SoundWave
			+Audio=DialogueWave
			[Internationalization.AssetGroupCultures]
			+Audio=ja

* Bugfix: Fixed an assert that could trigger when an IME composition is aborted during widget destruction. 

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash that could happen if a config was loaded while the Gather Text commandlet was running. 

* Bugfix: Fixed text namespaces being treated as case-insensitive when exported to JSON manifests and archives.

* Bugfix: Fixed text format history being clobbered by reference collection.

* Bugfix: Fixed the pluralization of the decorator text during drag-and-drop operations. 

* Vastly reduced the number of allocations that happen when rebuilding text at runtime.

#### Networking

* New: Network dormancy efficiency has been improved greatly (if you have large number of dormant actors, they now will have less overhead).

* New: Network consider/relevancy code is now also much more efficient. Overall, expect a 20+% improvement in performance if you have lots of Actors in the network Actor list. 

* New: Adaptive network update frequency logic is now on by default. This should improve network performance for games that weren't opt'ing in to this feature.

    * Net.UseAdaptiveNetUpdateFrequency is now 1 by default. 

* New: Replays now support network relevancy. 

    * All connections are considered when determining if an Actor is relevant. 

    * Enable by setting demo.UseNetRelevancy to 1.

* AActor "Pending Net Update" has been deprecated. Please use â€œPending Net Updateâ€ that is now on FNetworkObjectInfo (obtained by calling â€œGet Network Object Info).

* UNetDriver "Get Network Actor" is now deprecated. Use UNetDriver â€œGet Network Object Infoâ€ instead. 

* Disabled net.PartialBunchReliableThreshold for replays (we don't need to worry about bunch fragment sizes since there is no packet loss for replay connections).

#### Online

* New: Steamworks integration has been updated to support version 1.39, including updated steam controller support!

* New: Web Browser module no longer directly depends on Online Subsystem plugins.

    * It uses the Online Engine Interface shim to explicitly depend on the engine and will use Online Subsystem features when that module is optionally added.

* Reading the config hierarchy for TVOS now matches IOS to get the correct bundle id when packaging a project

#### Paper2D

* Bugfix: Custom tile maps using collision can now be created at runtime on any platform without crashing.  However on iOS/Android/HTML5 only the boxes and spheres used in the per-tile collision shapes have effect; arbitrary convex collision (e.g., slopes or other triangle-based collision) will not cause collisions or overlaps until support for PhysX runtime cooking is added to these platforms.

* Bugfix: The Paper2D flipbook editor now shows the current frame correctly when the animation timeline is longer than the editor window and the scroll bar is moved to the right.

* Bugfix: Paper2D flipbook editor now shows the correct number of frames; previously, it was one frame short.

#### Physics

* Bugfix: Fixed a memory leak caused by keeping PhysX shapes in memory after they are no longer being used.

* Expanded self-collision culling for clothing by providing a scale to tweak the culling queries. This makes a tradeoff between performance and accuracy.

* Added a guard against infinitely thin geometry, which fixes some NANs.

* Performance improvements to Anim node "Rigid Body".

* Physics performance is improved by skipping the update of kinematic bodies when they haven't moved.

#### Platforms

* New: Exposed JAVA_HOME setting in Android SDK Project Settings on Mac.

* New: Added "Platform Handle Splash Screen" to deal with hiding splash screen properly on Startup Movies. 

* New: Implemented support for new controllers (Xbox Wireless, SteelSeries Stratus XL, PS4).

    * Note: there are two implementations for Xbox Wireless due to differences in firmware. Firmware before 3.1.1221.0 does not use standard mapping which you can enable by setting the Android.OldXBoxWirelessFirmware CVar to 1 (defaults to new firmware).

* New: Added support for "r.ScreenPercentage" on mobile allowing the game scene to be rendered at lower resolution than the UI. Requires MobileHDR to be enabled.

* New: On-screen warnings now appear when a mobile shader permutation required to correctly render the current scene's lighting setup has been disabled in Project Settings.

* New: Made some big DeviceProfile changes, particularly for the protected platforms.

    * Changed the "type" of some DPs from WindowsNoEditor, etc to Windows. It should be a platform, not a random string.

    * With that change, the platform can be used to save out protected platform DP .ini files to subdirectories, maintaining secrecy

    * Added Config/[PlatformName]/ConfidentialPlatform.ini files so that the DP loading code knows to look in their directories for DPs. See FGenericPlatformMisc::GetConfidentialPlatforms() for more information.

* New: When uploading a HTML5 project to AWS S3, it now supports "signature version 4" authentication and better error message feedback on upload failures.

* New: Added "use fixed timestep" setting option for HTML5 builds (This has been separated from Engine > General Settings - Framerate).

    * This is slightly different to "Smooth Framerate" and â€œFixed Framerateâ€.

    * NOTE: Fixing the timestep does not guarantee the actual framerate. Calculations based on delta time may be adversely affected by this.

* New: Added iOS/Android support for new Audio Mixer.

* New: "Does Save Game Exist" will now show a message if the save data is corrupt. 

* New: Initial support for voice chat in the Android platform. To use enable the Voice module in DefaultEngine.ini, in the level bp create a session, and in project settings > Platforms > Android > Advanced APKPackaging, check the setting 'Add permissions to support Voice chat (RECORD_AUDIO)'. After this create a multiplayer game between two android devices.  For more information check pull request #2894.

* Add -distribution when iOS distribution Packaging. with IPhonePackager.exe.

* Changed mouse cursor to be always visible when running in Mobile Preview.

* Refactored memory allocation functions (BinnedAllocFromOS) on all platforms. Made Binned2 malloc work on Linux.

##### All Mobile

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash in mobile patching utilities mount method.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with the shader compile for Landscape on platforms below SM4 feature level.

##### Android

* New: Bad package names are now detected and APK generation is stopped with a proper error message instead of failing during Java compiling.

    * Package names with fewer than 2 segments are not allowed (e.g., "myproject" is not allowed, but â€œcom.myprojectâ€ is legal).

    * Only alphanumeric characters and underscore are allowed in the package name (Note: hyphens in the project name will be converted to underscores, but any other hyphens need to be corrected in Android project settings).

    * All segments must start with a letter; if your project name starts with a letter you will need to replace the [PROJECT] part of the package name in Android project settings.

    * Reserved Java keywords may not be used as the full segment; appending an underscore or other legal characters will fix this.

    * Segments may not be empty (e.g. "com..myproject" is not legal).

* New: Larger OBB files embedded in APK are now allowed by bypassing Asset Manager.

* New: We've implemented a first pass of Google Cloud Messaging plugin. This is considered an experimental feature for this release.

* New: Added missing key codes for keyboard input (@ and #).

* New: Added a drop-down with some common console commands on Android to the console dialog.

* New: Patches ant.bat to handle long command line issue on Windows.

    * Copies original ant.bat to ant.orig.bat and writes a new ant.bat which uses subst with an unused drive letter to shorten paths).

    * Note: you can edit the generated ant.bat if you need to change the drive letter used; the editor will not replace it if ant.orig.bat is found.

* New: Editor now checks to make sure that at least SDK Android-23 is selected and installed. There will be an error message if an earlier version is installed.

* New: Updated AAR handling to deal with versioning, subproject dependencies for resources, and scope (ignore test).

* New: Limited support for Xcode automatic code-signing for iOS/tvOS.

* New: Reimplement RQT_AbsoluteTime for Metal using a similar emulation to OpenGL on Mac so that the scalability system can correctly set the default graphics options. Not all drivers support this and in those cases the scalability settings are determined by an alternative, fixed, code-path.

* Bugfix: Fixed mouse position issues in fullscreen mode on Mac.

    * This can significantly reduce the size of the final .so file.

* New: Added support for map file generation with Android. 

* New: Crash reporter is no longer staged by default when packaging from the editor. The default endpoint for crashes was an Epic server, so including it in packaged games by default was not useful.

* New:Added FShaderCodeLibrary which handles de-duplication of shaders during content cooking and the shader code has moved into a separate library for cooked content runtime loading. This reduces package sizes and load-time overhead. 

* New: Added RHIShaderLibrary for platform specific native shader library implementations. This allows each platform to provide its own optimal shader library implementations. 

* New: Added Metal (MacOS and iOS) native shader library where shaders are loaded from a single Metal library improving the memory footprint, load time, and runtime compile times. 

* New: As part of the cook process for Metal, the archiving process also generate text shaders that can be used when running with optimized Metal shaders. Run with optimized shaders and while debugging with text source. 

* New: Added command line option "-noheartbeatthread" to disable heart beat thread.

* New: Full refactor of the GPU Skin Cache to fix multiple issues related to Editor, Persona, per-frame numbering. Memory limit is now set per World in the Project Settings > Rendering section.

* New: ShaderCache now supports running with multithreaded rendering.  Command line flag "-norhithread" is no longer required to enable this feature and can now be removed if it was being used solely for this purpose.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash with D3D12 in "Update Texture 2D".

* Bugfix: Fixed an assertion failure in basepass when trying to draw a mesh with Post Process Material.

##### FX

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with rendering corruption issue with 4 and 8 vertex instanced particles using the wrong Vertex Factory objects. 

    * D3D didn't need separate Vertex Factories due to the VertexDecl updating the stride at draw call time, but some platforms were affected.

##### Lighting

* New: Improved quality and significantly faster cubemap prefiltering for reflections and skylight. 

* New: Post Process Indirect Lighting Intensity no longer scales Skylight reflections.

* New: Screen Space Reflections (SSR) now has a higher quality setting for sharp SSR when using Quality Level 4.

* New: Distance field self shadowing controls for hiding world position offset self-shadow artifacts.

    * Removed Static Mesh Build Settings "Distance Field Bias", which shrunk the distance field, breaking AO and shadows.

* New: Distance field mesh visualization now uses a cone containing the entire tile to cull objects with, making the results stable.

* New: Distance field temporal filter stores a confidence value, which is used to track leaking of occlusion during the upsample, and flush those leaked values through the history faster. Reduces DFAO ghosting when the camera is moving.

* New: Added some new features to the Skylight component. 

    * "Occlusion Exponent" which is useful for brightening up indoors without losing contact shadows as â€œMin Occlusionâ€ does. 

    * "Occlusion Combine Mode" which is useful for artists to choose how to combine SSAO with Distance Field Ambient Occlusion.

* New: Added "r.AOListMeshDistanceFields" which dumps out mesh distance fields sorted by memory size, useful for directing content optimizations. 

* New: Planar reflections handle views smaller than the render target in a general way.

* New: Added MinimalAPI to several material expressions.

* New: Updated default behavior of "Power" node to no longer â€œabsâ€ or â€œmaxâ€ against an arbitrary value as the results were incorrect.

* New: Improved material translation preservation of constants.

    * This improves detection of used attributes which prevents some cases of features being enabled incorrectly.

* New: Material flag normal curvature to roughness now works in the Deferred Renderer. It is no longer forward only.

* New: Enabled "r.Streaming.UsePerTextureBias" by default as a way to improve quality in low texture budget settings.

* Bugfix: Fixed errors across various library Material Functions.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with broken size query for render targets in Material graphs. 

    * Implemented missing "Get Size" functionality.

* Bugfix: Fixed various data type inconsistencies on legacy Make and Break Material Attributes graph nodes.

    * Using these together with the "Get" and â€œSetâ€ Materia lAttributes nodes should now be more forgiving.

* Bugfix: Fixed a regression in HLOD shadow casting performance.

* Bugfix: Fixed inconsistent results with the "Investigate Texture" commands.

* Bugfix: Fixed possible incorrect results when listing textures used by Material Instances.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where Material Reroute nodes did not bind properly to Texture Object Parameters. 

##### Mobile Rendering

* New: Mobile Skylights no longer render the scene on the device to determine the sky's color. Mobile skylight uses values determined via captures performed in the editor. This saves memory and performance on device and enables Skylight contribution on devices that do not support fp16 render targets.

* New: Added "r.Mobile.TonemapperFilm" console variable which can be used to enable/disable new filmic tonemapper on Mobile devices, independently from Desktop platforms (disabled by default).

* New: Material AO is now supported for the Mobile Rendering path.

* New: Added better defaults for rendering resolution on iOS devices, to make them more inline with defaults on Android devices.

* Bugfix: Fixed several issues that could cause CSM shadowing on mobile devices to flicker.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with scene captures on mobile when Mobile HDR is disabled and the scene capture source is Scene Color.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue with bright dynamic point lights cause bloom rendering artifacts on Android Mali devices.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where Landscapes do not render on some Android PowerVR devices. 

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where translucent object appear black on Zenfone5.

* Bugfix: Fixed an redundant blend state change in OpenGL ES2.

* Mobile targeted projects will have better UI performance settings by default.

##### Optimizations

* New: Added 'r.CompressMeshDistanceFields' console command to rendering project settings, defaults to off to prevent hitches when streaming in levels.

    * When enabled, mesh distance fields are stored zlib compressed in memory until needed for uploading to GPU.

        * 81Mb of backing memory -> 32Mb in GPU Perf Test.

        * Atlas upload time 29ms -> 893ms.

* New: Added a new global distance field (4x 128^3 clipmaps) which caches mostly static primitives (Mobility set to Static or Stationary).

    * The full global distance field inherits from the mostly static cache, so when a Movable primitive is modified, only other movable primitives in the vicinity need to be re-composited into the global distance field.

    * Global distance field update cost with one large rotating object went from 2.5ms -> 0.2ms on 970GTX. Worst case full volume update is mostly the same.

* New: Added LOD Distance Factor to Scene Capture Component, which can be used to make scene captures and planar reflections much cheaper to render if the scene has good LODs setup.

* New: Added the r.LightMaxDrawDistanceScale console command for local light scalability.

* New: Added a rendering project setting to use 8 bit mesh distance fields.

    * This halves their memory requirement but introduces artifacts with large meshes.

* New: Added new async tasks to reduce the cost of the texture streaming update on the game thread.

* New: Added some automatic callbacks whenever dynamic component renderstates are updated in order to also update their texture streaming states.

* Bugfix: Fixed async SSAO not actually running asynchronously when depth drawing mode was DDM_AllOpaque.

* Bugfix: Fixed render queries stalling in Test/Shipping builds due to lack of pooling.

* Ray Traced Distance Field Shadow optimized.

    * From 1.8ms -> 0.8ms in a test scene.

* Use 16 bit indices for distance field objects culled to tiles, when 16 bit will be enough. This saves 10mb of tile culling buffers.

* GNM RHI Clear UAV uses a compute shader for buffers larger than 1Kb.

* GNM Structured buffers are now placed in GPU memory (was previously in CPU memory).

* DFAO optimizations:

    * Changed the culling algorithm to produce a list of intersecting screen tiles for each object, instead of the other way around. Each tile / object intersection gets its own cone tracing thread group so wavefronts are much smaller and scheduled better.

        * From 3.63ms -> 3.48ms (0.15ms saved).

    * Replaced slow instructions in inner loop with fast approximations (exp2 -> sqr + 1, rcpFast, lengthFast).

        * From 3.25ms -> 3.09ms (0.16ms saved).

    * Moved transform from world to local space out of the inner loop (sample position constructed from local space position + direction).

        * From 3.09ms -> 3.04ms (0.05ms saved).

* Structured buffers for DF object data.

    * Full global distance field clipmap composite 3.0ms -> 2.0ms due to scalarized loads.

* Exposed MaxObjectsPerTile with the 'r.AOMaxObjectsPerCullTile' console command and lowered the default from 512 to 256. This saves 17Mb of object tile culling data structures.

    * This can cause flickering in Ray Traced Distance Field shadows if too many objects fall into one shadowmap culling tile.

* Scene color resolves are restricted to the views. This fixes inefficiency with adaptive pixel density where the views don't match the view family size.

* When using a full prepass, the base pass no longer writes depth.

    * Saves 0.3ms of Scene Depth Resolve on 970 GTX with MSAA. Also allows masked materials to get EarlyZ in the base pass.

    * Fixed primitives with Use As Occluder set to false being excluded from a full depth pass in static draw lists.

    * Added the "r.BasePassWriteDepthEvenWithFullPrepass" console command for verifying that the base pass depths match the prepass depths.

* Changing movable skylight properties no longer affects static draw lists.

* Mesh distance field generation uses Embree, which provides a 2.5x speed increase.

* Cleared light attenuation for local lights with a quad covering their screen extents.

    * Clearing the entire light attenuation buffer costs 0.1ms. This optimization lowers the minimum cost of a shadow casting light from 0.15ms to 0.03ms.

* Flushed deferred deletes when reallocating distance field atlas to reduce peak memory, at the cost of a hitch on first frame.

* Disabled point / spot lights with Max Draw Distance on Low PC.

* Made use of Metal's "Deferred Store Actions" where available to avoid incorrect â€œStoreâ€ actions introduced when restarting passes to switch encoder types or when using the Metal RHI debugging tools.

* Stopped the Shader Cache recording all the RHI resources unless it is running on OpenGL. This significantly reduces the CPU overhead of enabling the Shader Cache.

* HLOD texture force loaded through the "r.Streaming.HLODStrategy" console command will now load visible mips first.

* The command "BuildMaterialTextureStreamingData" can now be used with "all" as argument to force a rebuild.

* Reduced the texture streaming overhead for components by keeping track of the state within the streamer.

##### Postprocessing

* New: Using Custom Depth to write to the stencil buffer now has the ability to use single-channel bitmasks that ignore depth. This makes it possible to detect overlaps between stencil objects.

* Bugfix: Fixed log value conversion in tonemapping causing true blacks to be lost.

* Motion blur no longer gets dark at the edges of the screen.

#### UI

* New: Added API to programmatically change the Virtual Cursors UMG Widget on the Viewport Client.

* Bugfix: Fixed sRGB conversion issues in Retainer Box when used with a material.

* Multiline editable text boxes can now be marked as read-only.

* Selecting multiple text widgets will now correctly set text when the text field is edited.

* Widget Components will now correctly determine between hover and clicked states when using or simulating touch.

##### Slate

* New: Added Enum Has All Flags and Enum Has Any Flags, templated functions to make it easier to check for the existence of a flag on enum classes.

* New: There is now a console variable option, Slate.VerifyHitTestVisibility (off by default), which enables additional visibility checks for widgets. Normally this is not necessary, but if you are changing the visibility of widgets during a frame, and several hit tests need to be performed that frame, there is a chance that a button could be clicked twice in one frame. Enabling this mode will make all hit testing more expensive, so for now it is off by default, but available for licensees that need the extra testing.

* New: Added the ability to invert alpha when drawing slate textures. This will be used in the future for rendering render targets for the scene which have inverted alpha.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash during editable text widget destruction while a context menu was still open.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when deleting a streamed font.

* Bugfix: Fixed lots of outline data being added to the font cache due to wrongly hashing outline material and color data.

* Bugfix: Tooltips will no longer show if the cursor is not directly over a Slate window. Fixed a case where the tooltip would not disappear when the cursor is moved over another application's window that was placed on top of a Slate window.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where the cursor would sometimes not appear when its visibility was changed. This was rooted in how the OS requested cursor changes, WM_SETCURSOR on Windows only asks for new cursors when the mouse moves, but often cursors change just because mouse capture changes. So now the path has been centralized in Slate Tick to only handle the cursor changes in one place, and several places that need to refresh the cursor state, now set a flag to handle it on next tick.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug with ZOrder being discarded on the SOverlay slot.

* Bugfix: Fixed Web Browser Viewport to properly scale.

* Bugfix: SButton now correctly releases mouse capture even if it becomes disabled while pressed, but before 'click' has been fired.

* Improved text rendering when the last resort font is missing.

    * The last resort font is no longer included in shipping builds, so this change makes some improvements to text rendering when it is missing.

        * The legacy font cache no longer tries to use the last resort font if it is not available (preventing warnings).

        * The Slate font renderer no longer tries to use the last resort font if it is not available.

        * Text shaping will use the last resort character if none of the available fonts can render a given character (likely because the last resort font is missing).

        * HarfBuzz shaped text now uses the fallback character correctly.

* Kerning-only text shaping no longer draws characters to get their metrics.

* Text selection height is now the maximum of the line height and text height to account for negative line-height scaling.

* Added a setting to control whether we should use the font metrics or the bounding box when laying out a font.

    * Not all fonts have accurate metrics data, so using the bounding box can produce much better results for certain fonts.

* Made slate loading widget / movie playback more thread safe by eliminating Slate application or the main window from being ticked directly on another thread. Is In Game Thread will also no longer return true when called from the slate loading widget thread.

* Force resolution in standalone if the resolution is larger than primary working area.

* Moved ESlateDrawEffect & ESlateBatchDrawFlag over to be enum class. Found cases where the enum order was being improperly assumed, and so now it will not be possible to just treat an int32 or a bool as the draw effect value.

* Slate Application now maintains separate tracking for each pointer being utilized for drag drop, so now multiple fingers on multiple widgets can now simultaneously be attempting a drag, however once one of them becomes successful, we clear all state of all other tracking since only one Drag Drop operation is possible at a time.

* Fold Tick is now removed from the codebase. We have not supported the other (non-folded) code path for awhile, so there was no point in maintaining the switch.

* The Checkbox widget no longer just passes visibility down to the internal widgets it creates, that prevents future changes to affect it if it starts collapsed.

##### UMG

* New: Added Timing Policy option to Widget Component, so widgets can optionally tick in pausable/dilatable game time rather than real time.

* New: Added a material function that exposes all of the current UV sets with nice names instead of indexed coordinates.

* New: Added a method to create Slate Brushes from Paper Sprites the same way we can for materials and textures in blueprints.

* New: Introduced PreConstruct and Native PreConstruct to the base User Widget. Users can now visualize non-binding based changes in the designer by evaluating a very limited amount of the blueprint code. In the event your user widget crashes on load, due to calling something unsafe, you can disable evaluation in the editor preferences under Widget Designer.

* New: Introduced a way to inform widgets of more information about the designer. There is now a Designer Changed event sent to all design time widgets letting them know things like the current screen size and DPI scale.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash if UI blurs are rotated.

* Bugfix: Outline color on text elements is now inherited properly.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug that prevented Get Owning Player in Widget from returning.

* Bugfix: Additional fixes to the way we migrate changes from the preview to the serialized version of the widget tree in the widget editor. This fixes several issues with edit-inline Objects on Widgets.

* Exposed a normalized (0-1) uv coordinate set and scaled pixel size for Box and Border brushes.

* Widget Interaction Components now ignore Visible(false) Widget Components when tracing.

* Widget animations now finish evaluating before firing an event alerting that the animation finished.

* The Widget Interaction Component now checks if the Widget is enabled before it claims that it is over an interactable or keyboard focusable widget.

* Adding some setters and getters for Redraw Time to the Widget Component.

* Widgets projected into screenspace from the Widget Component should now appear in the correct locations if the player's camera has an aspect ratio lock.

* The Safe Zone widget will now show the correct safe zone amount if you use the safezone command line options, which are now documented in the comment for the Safe Zone class.

* Widget switchers that contain widgets with named slots will now correctly display a widget whose named slot is currently selected.

* Widgets that are copied and pasted will now retain the same name in the widget hierarchy.

#### VR

* New: Added support for getting device depth from Scene Capture Component 2Ds.

* New: Added ability to disable the autoloading splash screen, which would prevent the manual "hide splash screen" node from working properly.

* New: Added Gear VR controller support.

* New: Added support for OES_EGL_image_external to the mobile GL renderer.

* Bugfix: Negative Stereo Layer priorities are now handled correctly on Steam VR.

* Bugfix: Fixed threading issue with motion controller tracking that caused controller motion pops.  This problem manifested intermittently.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash on Oculus Rift when attempting to enter stereo mode while the HMD's 'on head' proximity sensor is not triggered.

* Bugfix: Fixed low framerate when Oculus Rift 'on head' proximity sensor is not triggered and you exit stereo rendering.

* The GearVR HMD plugin is now only enabled on Windows if the Oculus service is already running.

* VR console commands have been rewritten to support autocompletion and inline help strings.

    * The VR console commands have also be renamed and now begin with vr.*.

    * The renamed VR commands have backwards compatible aliases, but will print a warning notifying the user about the deprecated functionality.

* GoogleVR HMD now reacts to changes in the r.ScreenPercentage console command.

* When the -hmd command line option is used to override the selected HMD, HMD plugins that are loaded early will now be unloaded during PreInit if not selected.

* Integrated OpenGL support for SteamVR.

* The left eye is used when selecting LODs to avoid selecting two separate LOD levels when rendering in stereo.

* PSVR controller tracking limit management system.

    * PSVR can track the HMD and two controllers, but many more devices can be connected. With this system you can manage which controllers are tracked to stay under the limit.

* Additional WorldScale refactoring for all platforms.

* GoogleVR plugin updated to version 1.3

* Fixed Android manifest for Daydream and Cardboard.

* Updated GoogleVR plugin to version 1.3.

* GoogleVR SDK updated to 1.40.0.

* GoogleVR Mode default changed to Daydream and Cardboard.

## Programming Release Notes

#### AI

* New: Added a new mode to composite EQS generator (UEnvQueryGenerator_Composite), which allows the use of different types of items by each child generator. This can be enabled by advanced properties: bAllowDifferentItemTypes and ForcedItemType. ForcedItemType is the final type returned by the generator, and is used for allocating memory and executing tests. This mode is potentially unsafe and you will have to ensure proper memory layout (matching with ForcedItemType) of all item types used by child generators - usually subsets of ForcedItemType. Keep in mind that allocated memory block is zeroed before use.

##### Debugging Tools

* Bugfix: Fixed VisualLog macros for recording segments with user defined thickness.

* Bugfix: Fixed compilation errors in VisualLog macros for recording custom meshes.

##### Navigation

* Bugfix: Fixed memory corruption in generic A* solver: FGraphAStar.

* Bugfix: Fixed unique Id duplicates in custom navigation links.

* Bugfix: Fixed FRecastTileGenerator::Modifiers being erroneously counted twice when stating memory.

* NavModifierVolume has been marked as ENGINE_API and can now be freely used in game code.

* Made FNavAgentProperties::GetExtent return INVALID_NAVEXTENT if a prop's AgentRadius is not set. This results in properly using  FNavAgentProperties::DefaultProperties in navigation queries when no query extent override is provided.

#### Animation

* New: Added more exports to AnimationAsset, AnimSequenceBase, and Skeleton classes.

##### Animation Blueprint

* Bugfix: Fixed nodes only getting CopyNodeDataToPreviewNode called when pin defaults were changed (not any property change).

##### Skeletal Mesh

* New: Added exports to FFbxImporter, FDynamicSkelMeshObjectDataCPUSkin, and FSkeletalMeshObjectCPUSkin, for extensibility.

#### Audio

* New: Added new cvars to help with optimization (only applies to the new Audio Mixer).

    * au.DisableReverbSubmix, au.DisableEQSubmix, â€‹au.DisableParallelSourceProcessing, au.SetAudioChannelCount

* Bugfix: Fixed MIDI Device plugin public headers not being able to be included from an external module.

* Optimized internals of new Audio Mixer. Gains approach 15% savings from before:

    * Turned a float divide into a multiply, which occurred at least 32k times per audio update.

    * Avoided thousands of Array.Add() calls during processing, which on shipping still does checks to see if the allocator has to grow, and updates ArrayCount.

    * Removed pointer indirection and successive TArray Add()s in GetChannelMap().

    * Removed function call overhead to updating channel map.

    * Simplified FSourceParam::Update() to reduce branching and have one return site.

    * Added alternative to GetChannelMap() called UpdateChannelMap() that avoids copying out values to an array. The values can then be fetched from the channel data directly.

    * Refactored internal data to use array of structs rather than struct of arrays for better cache coherency when processing channels one at a time.

#### Blueprints

* New: Added an error when declaring a Blueprint Implementable Event with an enum param that is not plain or a byte type (Blueprints only support byte-sized enums).

#### Core

* New: There are now several serialization options available to specify what the cooked Asset Registry includes. Look for the serialize flags inside the [AssetRegistry] section of BaseEngine.ini.

* New: An experimental bUseAssetRegistryForIteration option has been added to CookerSettings. This improves the performance of iterative cooking by loading the cooked Asset Registry directly, but it may still have issues with some changes to source files being missed.

* New: Added a cvar to control the pak precacher throttle.

* New: Added new GenericPlatformFile function, GetTimeStampLocal, which returns file time stamp in local time instead of UTC.

* New: Added a check against assembling the reference token stream while streaming without locking the garbage collector.

* New: Added a static_assert to prevent the use of TMap keys which do not implement GetTypeHash, as this causes runtime crashes when they are manipulated by a UMapProperty.

* New: Added a bForceDebugUnrealHeaderTool option to BuildConfiguration.xml which forces the Debug version of UnrealHeaderTool to be run instead of Development.

* New: Added a static_assert to ensure that TInlineSetAllocator is instantiated with a power-of-two hash size, as this is a requirement for TSet and TMap.

* New: Added ICppStructOps::IsAbstract() for testing if a native type is abstract via the property system.

* Bugfix: Fixed TInlineValue not calling virtual destructors.

* Bugfix: Fixed several issues with editor-only objects not being correctly stripped when cooking.

* Bugfix: Fixed several issues with Config files loaded from Plugins. They now correctly handle diffing game-specific changes. Engine plugins config files should be named BasePluginname.ini, and game plugins should be DefaultPluginname.ini.

* Bugfix: Fixed many bugs with the event driven loader and allowed it to work at boot time.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug with nativized Blueprints that was introduced with the boot time EDL changes.

* Bugfix: Fixed race in audio streaming.

* Bugfix: Fixed bug which would cause a fatal error when cooking subobjects that were pending kill.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug with EDL at boot time which caused a fatal error with unfired imports.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug with RF_PendingKill subobjects and the new loader.

* Bugfix: Fixed an obscure problem with stats in commandlets that use async tasks.

* Bugfix: Fixed rare ensure cooking for the EDL.

* Bugfix: Fixed boot time EDL causing some issues even when it wasn't being used.

* Bugfix: Fixed .pak precacher shutdown.

* Bugfix: Fixed memory leak in .pak precacher.

* Bugfix: Fixed bad merge of priority change in the EDL.

* Bugfix: Fixed race that resulted in a memory leak when reading compressed paks.

* Bugfix: Fixed a weird recursive situation where StaticLoadObject could return an object that has not finished loading. Also produces a fatal error if this happens. EDL only.

* Bugfix: Fixed batched render fences when BeginDestroy calls FlushRenderingCommands.

* Bugfix: Fixed loading a package that is already loaded.

* Bugfix: Fixed crash in signature checks when mounting pak files.

* Bugfix: Fixed a change to NotifyPrimitiveDetached so that it works in the editor.

* Bugfix: Fixed hash table lock optimization.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash relating to FGenericAsyncReadFileHandle when not using the EDL.

* Bugfix: Fixed comments in GenericPlatform.h.

* Bugfix: Fixed errors raised during code generation when a multiply-inherited base class happens to have the same name as a UObject after its prefix is stripped.

* Bugfix: Fixed a compile error when calling TArray::HeapSort on an array of pointers.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when calling UCookOnTheFlyServer::FFilePlatformRequest::ToString().

* Bugfix: Fixed compile errors raised when #pragma is used inside USTRUCTs.

* Bugfix: Fixed compile errors caused by whitespace existing before a UCLASS() macro.

* Bugfix: Fixed TStructOpsTypeTraits<T>::WithCopy giving different results when the trait is specialized without a WithCopy value from when it isn't specialized at all.

* Bugfix: Fixed a compile error when serializing bools to an archive in editor builds, where the archive type overrides other serialization operators.

* Bugfix: Fixed FWorldTileInfo::Read() to copy the correct licensee version number from the file summary into the archive.

* Bugfix: Fixed a regression in FObjectAndNameAsStringProxyArchive to re-allow serialization of TWeakObjectPtrs.

* Bugfix: Fixed some include-what-you-use issues in the engine and plugins.

* Bugfix: Fixed UPROPERTYs being skipped when there are redundant semi-colons between the properties.

* Asset Registry memory and performance have been significantly improved in both Editor and cooked games for large projects.

* Allowed UnrealPak to do a better job with EDL pak files when the order provided is old or from the cooker.

* Several minor tweaks to low level async IO stuff.

* Stored a copy of the callback in async read request so that we do not need to worry about lifetime so we can capture variables as needed.

* Cancelling async loading with the EDL loader now prints a warning and does a flush instead.

* Suppressed a few EDL cook warnings.

* Tweaked the EDL for to all platforms.

*  Platform load time performance tweaks.

*  Abstracted the IO tracker and handle manager for other platforms and applied it to all platforms.

* Protected against UDeviceProfileManager::Get() recursion and demoted a related fatal error to a log statement.

* Removed old code relating to FAsyncArchive, FAsyncIOSubsystemBase and package level compression. The editor now uses the lowest levels on the new async IO scheme.

* Increased estimate of summary size.

* Avoided adding a linker annotation if it actually has not changed. This improves ConditionalBeginDestroy performance.

* Avoided a redundant removal of PrimitiveComponent from the streaming managers during ConditionalBeginDestroy.

* Optimized UObject hash tables for speed and space.

* Put the special boot order things into baseengine.ini so that licensees and games can add to it.

* Renamed HasBeenAlreadyMadeSharable to DoesSharedInstanceExist.

* PostLoadSubobjects is now called on all objects regardless of whether they have a CDO as outer or not.

* When Rename is used to change the Outer without specifying a new name, the existing name is maintained whenever possible.

* ForwardVector, RightVector, and single float FVector constructors are now recognized by Unreal Header Tool as default values for an FVector parameter.

* ScriptMacros.h no longers needs to be included in header files that generate a header.

* Improved the readability of some of the ReferenceChainSearch code.

* Automatically included ObjectMacros.h in generated headers to prevent compile errors.

* Made FPaths::Combine() variadic so that it can take arbitrary numbers of arguments.

* Improved the readability of the verbosity of log categories in the debugger.

* Updated TArray::Sort comments to clarify what happens when sorting an array of pointers.

* Clarified the assertion message you get when inserting or removing a TArray element by reference which comes from the array.

* Clarified the comments for TArray::FindLastByPredicate and FString::FindLastCharByPredicate.

* Removed UnrealCodeAnalyzer.

* Raised an error in UnrealHeaderTool when a header containing UCLASSes, USTRUCTs etc. does not include its .generated.h file.

* Removed TBoolConstant template.

* Changed TAssetPtr<T> to allow it to be constructed from nullptr without a full definition of T.

* Removed the WITH_HOT_RELOAD_CTORS macro.

* Removed the UseVTableConstructors .ini option.

* Removed generated FName variables for UFUNCTIONs.

* Removed the generation of obsolete .java and .proto files used for replication.

* Replaced the set of bools used to FBlueprintCompileReinstancer with a new EBlueprintCompileReinstancerFlags enum.

* Improved hot reload logging messages to make it clear that a compile attempt on a module does not guarantee a reload of that module.

* Made UnrealHeaderTool report an error if a UFUNCTION in a derived class has the same name but a different signature from one in a base class.

#### Editor and Tools

* New: Added spinner options to VectorInputBox.

* New: Added a None option to the FKey customization, unless the FKey property had NoClear on it.

* Bugfix: Implemented a fix to ensure FVirtualTrackArea::HitTestSection checks the row of the section.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue where ISequenceAudioRecorder was inaccessible to FAudioRecorder.

* Project and plugin templates now use "include what you use" style by default.

* When using BuildGraph, the cached list of completed nodes is now cleared by default, making the -ClearHistory argument redundant. Use the -Resume argument to continue an interrupted build using the current artifacts.

* BuildGraph now outputs an error if any build products from previous steps are tampered with during the execution of a subsequent step.

* The editor now offers to download and install Visual Studio 2017 if an existing version of Visual Studio is not found.

* The AutomationTool -CookDir argument no longer accepts multiple parameters separated by '+' characters, since '+' is valid in directory names. Multiple -CookDir arguments are supported instead.

* Game mods can now be denoted by setting the bIsMod field to true inside the .uplugin descriptor. Mods will be shown in a separate category in the plugin browser, and will be shown separately in generated project files. Installed editor builds can build and clean mods without modifying build products for the base game.

##### Content Browser

* Bugfix: Fixed link error when FAssetData::PrintAssetData() is used in a project.

##### Sequencer

* Unified global and object-bound pre animated state, and added InitializeObjectForAnimation method to state producers.

* Opened the API for MovieSceneAudio-related classes along with some minor functionality additions.

* Exported MovieSceneTrackEditor to allow custom tracks to be created that derive from existing tracks.

#### Gameplay Framework

* New: Added support for FScopedMovementUpdate to be able to queue up overlaps that do not require reflexive bGenerateOverlapEvents. This requires custom code to be able to process these overlaps.

    * This allows custom inspection or processing of overlaps within a scoped move, without enabling the more expensive overlap flag. For instance you could have a fast projectile with an overlap response to a character mesh and get those overlaps from the trace without requiring expensive overlap processing when the mesh moves.

    * Overlap events from the move will still only trigger from UpdateOverlaps() if bGenerateOverlapEvents is enabled on both components, as before.

    * Made some data in FScopedMovementUpdate protected rather than private so it can easily be subclassed, and exposed a new helper â€‹SetWorldLocationAndRotation() for committing the move.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash when manipulating audio component properties from an Actor's constructor during async loading.

* Bugfix: Fixed CharacterMovementComponent updates with very high delta time on server when initially joining. Made sure the ServerTimeStamp is initialized to current world time rather than zero to prevent large delta.

* CheatManager functions to Damage/Destroy targets are now easier to override in game-specific subclasses.

* InputComponent now has BindAction function that allows binding functions with additional parameters.

* RawInput configuration structures can now be manipulated by other modules.

* AActor::GetComponents() with generic type is now optimized to not force an allocation when the component count is large.

    * Previously it incorrectly assumed the output array needed space for the entire contents of OwnedComponents. If OwnedComponents.Num() > the array reserve size, this forced an allocation, even if few or no components of the requested type were found.

    * It is still recommended to use TInlineComponent array or an array using TInlineAllocator<> when using this function.

* Removed allocations during creation in â€‹AAIController::PostInitializeComponents() (in non-shipping builds).

* Optimized HasActiveCameraComponent() and â€‹HasActivePawnControlCameraComponent() to avoid filling an array while searching for a certain component, which could have caused an allocation.

* Optimized MoveComponent() collision queries to avoid processing PhysX touches when bGenerateOverlapEvents is off.

    * Added support for bIgnoreTouches to FCollisionQueryParams. This allows GeomSweepMulti to filter out touches/overlaps much earlier.

* MovementComponent does not ignore initial blocking overlaps when moving away from the impact normal from SafeMoveUpdatedComponent(). This fixes various cases where characters could be pushed through moving objects because they were moving away from the overlapping object, but not fast enough.

    * It now always uses the hit result to depenetrate from the impact as much as possible, and then retries the move.

    * Hit events are not triggered for the first test for depenetration.

* CharacterMovement AdjustFloorHeight() is now allowed to adjust using the line trace if the sweep was in penetration. It also forces another next floor check so it will check after it adjusts the height or depenetrates, relevant when bAlwaysCheckFloor is off.

* Optimized CharacterMovement tick to not extract transform values twice when they would not change in a small block of code.

* Call TickCharacterPose() and clear root motion before abandoning tick in â€‹UCharacterMovementComponent::PerformMovement() when movement mode is None. This prevents root motion building up until the next valid movement mode.

* Applied a performance tweak to â€‹ApplyRadialDamageWithFalloff().

    * Do not rebuild FRadialDamageEvent each loop over hit actors.

    * Added stats for â€‹BreakHitResult()/MakeHitResult() under "stat game".

* Optimized attachment to check welding option before expensive casts and body instance fetching.

#### Localization

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug where passing an empty FText to ChangeKey() would keep the previous FText value that had been passed in.

#### Online

* New: Added the bShowSkipButton parameter to IOnlineExternalUI::ShowLoginUI, which will display the "skip" button on relevant platforms.

#### Other

* New: Added missing initialization for SWindow::bIsMirrorWindow.

* Bugfix: Added missing module dependencies.

* Bugfix: Fixed a type casting issue.

#### Physics

* New: Added virtual keyword to DestructibleComponent ApplyDamage and ApplyDamageRadius.

* New: Added Physx simulation shader override (see GSimulationFilterShader).

* Bugfix: Fixed a debug rendering issue by recreating physics when changing mobility of components.

* Bugfix: Fixed compile error when PHYSX_MEMORY_STATS=1.

* Bugfix: Fixed performance regression caused by using collision aggregates for Instanced Static Mesh Component.

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash in AABB Manager when origin shift is used.

* Made UDestructibleComponent::SpawnFractureEffectsFromDamageEvent virtual.

* Exported URadialForceComponent class for inheritance.

* Allowed the editor to compile when bRuntimePhysicsCooking is disabled (cooking is still allowed in WITH_EDITOR builds even with it disabled).

* EndPhysics tick will no longer be scheduled if QueryOnly is used on a ragdoll.

* Removed the unsupported option of HideBone with DisableCollision when calling HideBone. This was not actually supported and did nothing so shouldn't break any behavior, just don't call the function.

* Exposed PhysX enhanced determinism mode using the compiler flag PHYSX_ENABLE_ENHANCED_DETERMINISM. This allows local subsets of the PhysX simulation to behave deterministically independent of what is going on elsewhere in the Physics world.

#### Platforms

* Bugfix: Fixed a crash bug in cases where we received a duplicate user login/logout notification from the system software.

* Bugfix: Fixed Codelite project having duplicated settings.

* Moved some C++ defines out of the build.cs file into a C++ header.

* Moved controller connect/disconnect handling to the main thread to fix issues with thread safety for callbacks.

##### Android

* New: Added functionality to use the visual studio mobile projects for debugging.  To generate them run "generateprojectfiles.bat -vsdebugandroid" from a command prompt.  After you have packaged your game for Development and put it on the device, you can set this new project as the start up project and run/debug the project in Visual Studio.

* New: Support for Android runtime permissions added. Certain permissions have been removed or put under condition to check for support when the target sdk is greater than or equal to 23.  

##### HTML5

* New: Added new webassembly (wasm) toolchain - SIMD and multi-threading are not yet supported (these are slated to be in for wasm2).

    * These will be automatically turned off when building with wasm (as opposed to asm.js).

* Removed HTML5 code from the Engine's SaveGameSystem.h and placed it in HTML5Platform.cpp.

* Cleaned up HTML5PlatformFile.cpp and made it match as close as possible to linux's version.

* Created HTML5's own PlatformFeature & SaveGameSystem files, and updated HTML5PlatformMisc to make use of the the new HTML5 SaveGame code.

##### Linux

* New: Added FreeBSD memory information functions to facilitate out-of-tree UE4 FreeBSD port.

* New: Added a new cross-toolchain (version 9, includes clang 4.0) when targeting Linux on Windows.

* New: Added some support for building on Debian Sid or Stretch.

* New: Added clang to Fedora dependencies.

* New: Added ability to compile Linux servers for 32-bit x86 architecture.

* New: Added files generated for KDevelop to .gitignore.

* Bugfix: Fixed more third party libraries to use libc++ instead of libstdc++.

* Bugfix: Fixed memory leaks when symbolicating an address in Linux callstacks (during crash reporting and memory profiling). Makes runs with the memory profiler much faster.

* Bugfix: Fixed rebuilding of VHACD (a third party library) on a case sensitive filesystem.

* Bugfix: Fixed CodeLite projects to now use proper Debug binaries for debug configurations.

* Switched Linux file abstraction to use new managed filehandles. Shared by all platforms with low limit of open files.

* Whitelisted SteamVR plugin for Linux so SteamVR Blueprint functions are always available, even if stubbed.

* Made source code accessor aware of clang 3.9 and 4.0.

* Setup will now install the latest clang on Arch instead of clang35.

##### Mac

* Fixed address sanitizer support in MacToolChain (Apple changed the name of the env variable Xcode uses to enable it) and added support for thread sanitizer.

* Fixed a problem where the glslang library was not enabled on Mac, preventing building an Android project with Vulkan from Mac.

* Made Binned2 malloc work on Mac.

#### Programming

* New: When compiling a module written in include-what-you-use style, source files which are in the adaptive non-unity working set are now built with precompiled headers disabled, to expose errors with missing headers. Set bAdaptiveUnityDisablesPCH to false in BuildConfiguration.xml to disable this behavior.

* New: Added initial support for async creation of pipeline state objects, enable using r.AsyncPipelineCompile.

* Module .build.cs files, which depend on the contents of external files, can now add those paths to the ExternalDependencies list. Modifications to those files will trigger the the UBT makefile to be invalidated.

* Plugin config files are now included in generated project files.

* UnrealBuildTool will no longer attempt to use SN-DBS for build distribution if the service is disabled.

* UnrealBuildTool now correctly supports compiling modular targets which do not use the shared engine build environment.

* C# programs will now be included in generated project files automatically if a blank file called UE4CSharp.prog is found in the same directory.

* The engine will now warn when trying to load a plugin with a mismatched "EngineVersion" setting.

* Deprecated shared pointer typedef from ImageWrapper and removed usages.

* Removed boilerplate header from ImageWrapper.

* Removed monolithic boilerplate header from NetworkFileSystem.

* Removed boilerplate header from LauncherCheck.

* LauncherServices: Removed boilerplate header from LauncherServices.

* Completed a modernization pass of Automation.

#### Rendering

* New: Added thickness option to debug DrawWireDiamond function.

* New: Added a check to see if there are duplicated shader type names.

* Bugfix: Fixed obscure check with flushing RHI resources.

* Bugfix: Fixed hazard with SetMaterialUsage from a thread.

* Bugfix: Fixed Windows handling of -sm4 and -sm5 so it can be used with -vulkan and -opengl.

* Bugfix: Fixed selection of swapchain format for Vulkan on some Linux drivers.

* Bugfix: Fixed an issue on Vulkan when copying into a cubemap face.

* Bugfix: Fixed a bug calculating vertex declaration hashes on OpenGL.

* Moved FPositionVertexBuffer & FStaticMeshVertexDataInterface declarations into their own headers, moved FStaticMeshVertexBuffer implementation into its own source file.

* Updated Vulkan distributables and glslang to SDK 1.0.39.1.

* Vulkan shaders now build using glslang 1.0.42.2 and includes those headers for redistribution.

* Prefer D32_S8 on Vulkan instead of D24_S8 for the depth buffer.

* Removed the temporary functions RHIClearColorTexture, RHIClearDepthStencilTexture and RHIClearColorTextures from each RHI.

* Separated depth/stencil load/store actions.

* Use the latest SDK for Vulkan, whether the one we distribute in ThirdParty or an installed version.

* Implemented SetStencilRef() and SetBlendFactor() on RHIs which were missing  it.

#### UI

##### Slate

* Updated Slate to allocate widgets using MakeShared.

    * This saves one allocation per-widget.

* Moved SVirtualWindow into Slate module from UMG.

#### VR

* New: Added an initial base implementation of IHeadMountedDisplay, FHeadMountedDisplayBase, that can be extended by HMD implementations instead of extending IHeadMountedDisplay directly. This base class provides default and or common implementations for parts of the IHeadMountedDisplay interface. Future releases may add more common functionality to this class, reducing the amount of work required to add support for new HMD platforms even further.

* StereoLayers now have a default emulated implementation, making them supported on most VR platforms that did not already support them. HMD implementations that extend FHeadMountedDisplayBase will automatically inherit the functionality unless explicitly overridden.

* Common code found in various HMD plugins handling management of StereoLayers has been extracted into a template base class, TStereoLayerManager<LayerData>, that provides a thread-safe way to manage a list of registered stereo layers.

* The old Morpheus StereoLayers implementation has been removed in favor of the common stereo layers implementation provided by the HMD base class.

## Upgrade Notes

#### C++ API Changes

* As part of the Asset Manager changes, Streamable Manager has been improved to support the concept of Streamable Handles. When requesting an async load, it now returns a shared pointer handle that will keep the requested object loaded as long as it exists. These handles can also be polled or waited on.

    * Synchronous Load and Simple Async Load on Streamable Manager have been deprecated in favor of the new Streamable Handle system. Both of those functions would keep assets loaded until explicitly unloaded, which in practice was not what most people wanted.

* The Class/Property/Function redirect system has been rewritten to be faster and more flexible. Ini redirects such as "+ActiveClassRedirects" defined in [/Script/Engine.Engine] will still work, but the new system is used by putting redirects like â€œ+ClassRedirectsâ€ in the [CoreRedirects] section of Engine.ini.

    * All engine redirects prior to 4.10 have been moved to CoreRedirects.cpp, newer redirects are now in the new format in BaseEngine.ini.

    * A single Property/Function redirect definition will now be applied for both blueprints and serialization, and redirects can now be defined with wildcard matching syntax to simplify large refactors.

    * Object and Package redirects can now be used to allow limited redirection of content references without creating an Object Redirector on disk.

    * Enum redirects have been improved and will now fully work with or without the Enum Name being specified.

* Several Enum functions dealing with string conversion have been deprecated, and the names and comments have been cleaned up to make it more clear which are meant to be used at Runtime and which are meant to be used in the Editor/for debugging.

* The console command "r.MSAACount 1" now produces no MSAA or TAA. â€œr.MSAACount 0â€ can be used to toggle TAA on for comparisons.

* Cascaded Shadow Map resolution is now controlled by the console command "r.Shadow.MaxCSMResolution" instead of â€œr.Shadow.MaxResolutionâ€.

* New mobile targeted projects will have better UI performance settings by default.

    * Please enable "Explicit Canvas Child Z Order" option in project Slate Settings, to improve UI batching. Enabling this option may require manual Z Order tweaks in UMG Canvas panels if there Z ordering issues.

* VR console commands have been rewritten to support autocompletion and inline help strings.

    * The VR console commands have also be renamed and now begin with vr.*

    * The renamed VR commands have backwards compatible aliases, but will print a warning notifying the user about the deprecated functionality.

* The Exec method in Head Mounted Display has been removed, as all VR console commands now use Auto Console Command or similar to register console commands.

    * HMD implementations relying on having an Exec method now need to provide their own ways of registering console command handlers.

* Set Visibility and Set Hidden In Game in Scene Component are no longer virtual. Instead override On Visibility Changed or On Hidden In Game Changed to respond to changes to these values.

* The FBox and FBox2D constructors taking an int32 value have been deprecated as the value of that integer was not being used. The Force Init constructor should be used instead.

    * Replace FBox/FBox2D construction of the form FBox(0) with FBox(ForceInit).

* The Unreal Header Tool now outputs an error when an Editor-only struct member is exposed to blueprints. This is necessary because packaged builds will crash if a Make/Break node for that struct is executed in a blueprint.

    * Any Blueprint exposed Editor-only struct members must either be made not Editor-only or no longer exposed to blueprints.

* Post Load Map now provides the loaded World as a parameter to the delegate function. The World will be null if the load failed.

    * All existing functions bound to Post Load Map need to have a World pointer added to their signature.

* Stop saving raw curve data into animations on cook to save memory/disk space.

    * If you are directly accessing Raw Curve Data on an Anim Sequence, this will no longer work in cooked builds. Animation Asset now provides a virtual function, Get Curve Data, to grab a reference to the correct Curve structure.

* Removed boilerplate header from Automation Window.

    * The AutomationWindow.h boilerplate header file has been removed. Please replace all includes of AutomationWindow.h with IAutomationWindowModule.h

* Removed boilerplate header from Automation Controller.

    * The AutomationController.h boilerplate header file has been removed.  Instead of AutomationController.h, include the individual interface headers that you actually use. Remove the "Interfaces/" subdirectory from existing interface inclusions.

* Automation Modernization pass

    * The IAutomationWorkerModule.h has been moved to the module's public root directory. Please remove the relative path from your existing include statements.

* Removed boilerplate header from LauncherCheck.

    * The LauncherCheck.h boilerplate header file has been removed. Include ILauncherCheckModule.h instead of LauncherCheck.h. Remove "Interfaces/" subdirectory from existing ILauncherCheckModule.h inclusions.

* Removed boilerplate header from LauncherServices.

    * The LauncherServices.h boilerplate header file has been removed. Instead of including LauncherServices.h, include the ILauncherXXX.h files that you actually use. Remove the "Interfaces/" subdirectory from existing ILauncherXXX.h includes.

* Deprecated shared pointer typedef and removed usages from ImageWrapper.

    * The IImageWrapperPtr typedef has been deprecated. Please use TSharedPtr<IImageWrapper> instead of IImageWrapperPtr.

* Removed boilerplate header from ImageWrapper.

    * The ImageWrapper.h boilerplate header file has been removed. Instead of including ImageWrapper.h, include the actual IImageWrapperXXX.h files that you use. Remove the "Interfaces/" subdirectory from existing IImageWrapperXXX.h includes.

* Removed monolithic boilerplate header from NetworkFileSystem.

    * The NetworkFileServer.h boilerplate header file has been removed. Instead of including NetworkFileServer.h, include the INetworkFileXXX.h headers that you actually use. Remove the "Interfaces/" subdirectory from existing INetworkFileXXX.h includes.

* Changed default contact-gen method to PCM. This is the default in PhysX 3.4.

    * This may have slight implications on jitter and stability, but should be improved overall. The old behavior is still available (set EnablePCM = false in the project settings).

* Removed the temporary functions RHIClearColorTexture, RHIClearDepthStencilTexture, and RHIClearColorTextures from each RHI.

* Removed obsolete SmartCastProperty function.

* Added a static_assert to prevent the use of TMap keys which do not implement GetTypeHash, as this causes runtime crashes when they are manipulated by a UMapProperty.

    * TMap key types must now implement GetTypeHash.  Having GetTypeHash be implemented in a base class or being implicitly convertible to a type which is hashable is not sufficient.

* Fixed TStructOpsTypeTraits<T>::WithCopy giving different results when the trait is specialized without a WithCopy value from when it isn't specialized at all.

    * TStructOpsTypeTraitsBase has been deprecated.

* Improved support for TTuple.

    * Tuples have a GetTypeHash function and can be used as a TMap key.

    * Can now be serialized to archives.

    * Can now be compared for equality with operators == and !=.

    * Can now be compared lexicographically with operators <, >, <= and >=.

    * TPair is now an alias for a 2-tuple, which is specialized to have Key and Value fields, but otherwise has the same functionality as all other tuples.

    * Tuple.h is now found in the Core/Public/Templates folder, rather than the Core/Public/Delegates folder.

    * TPairInitializer now converts to TPair, rather than TPair being constructible from TPairInitializer.

* Removed UnrealCodeAnalyzer.

* Added a static_assert to ensure that TInlineSetAllocator is instantiated with a power-of-two hash size, as this is a requirement for TSet and TMap.

    * TInlineSetAllocator will no longer compile if the hash size is not a power-of-two.

* Removed TBoolConstant template.

* Removed the WITH_HOT_RELOAD_CTORS macro.

* Removed the UseVTableConstructors .ini option.

* Removed generated FName variables for UFUNCTIONs.

* Refactored EvaluateBoneTransforms to prevent usage of skeletal mesh component.

    * Deprecated EvaluateBoneTransforms in favor of new â€‹EvaluateSkeletalControl_AnyThread.

    * Deprecated skeletal mesh component argument to ConvertCSTransformToBoneSpace and â€‹ConvertBoneSpaceTransformToCS. Now they just take a transform.

* Added a new overload for IOnlineSession::FindFriendSession in the session interface that can retrieve sessions for multiple friends.

    * Sending and accepting invites on dedicated servers on Steam is now supported.

    * The FOnFindFriendSessionCompleteDelegate now returns an array of FOnlineSessionSearchResult objects instead of just one.

* The high level rendering code is now PipelineStateObject aware which will allow us to reduce complexity in the rendering backends of Vulkan, Metal and Dx12 in the future.

    * The loose state setting APIs of the Commandlist have been deprecated, instead the entire pipelinestate has to be set at once.

* Moved controller connect/disconnect handling to the main thread to fix issues with thread safety for callbacks.

#### Animation

* When converting skeletal controls to the newer API, convert EvaluateBoneTransforms to â€‹EvaluateSkeletalControl_AnyThread. Backwards compatibility will be maintained, however warnings will persist. Any mesh component access should be cached in PreUpdate() as accessing the component is not thread safe.

* If differences in timing between Maya and UE4 are experienced after importing Alembic files, this has been corrected. The fix requires that any problematic assets be reimported.

#### Blueprints

* The ticking behavior of latent actions in components has been changed to match how they behave in actors.  When the component ticks, the latent actions will now be processed at the same time, rather than happening later in the frame when latent actions for non-ticking actors and components are processed.  This does change behavior, so there is a console variable (t.TickComponentLatentActionsWithTheComponent) that can be used to revert to the older behavior until affected component Blueprints that depended on the old ordering behavior can be fixed up. The cvar should be treated as deprecated, and it will be removed in a future release.

#### Core

* To save on memory and disk space the cooked Asset Registry no longer includes Dependency information by default. If you need this information at runtime, enable bSerializeDependencies in the [AssetRegistry] section of BaseEngine.ini.

* Starting asynchronous loads from within asynchronous loads has always been unsafe, but will now explicitly assert. This can be fixed by not starting asynchronous loads from within PostLoad functions, or deferring your game-specific code for a frame when called from an async callback.

* Callback functions passed into Request Async Load will now execute on the next frame instead of immediately upon completion of an async load. This behavior is to avoid issues with calling async loads recursively, but if your game depends on this behavior you can restore it to call them immediately by setting the cvar s.StreamableDelegateDelayFrames to 0.

* There is a new format for defining class/function/property redirects in ini files, check the [CoreRedirects] section of BaseEngine.ini for examples. The older formats will still work but the new format provides additional features and a simpler syntax so you may want to upgrade.

* Any calls to Smart Cast Property should be replaced with code which explicitly handles the inner property of Array Property.

* Get Type Hash implementations must now be added to types which are used as TMap keys.  If your type defines Get Type Hash in a base class or is hashed via an implicit conversion, these should be fixed by implementing their own function and forwarding the call to the appropriate implementation.

* Any use of TStructOpsTypeTraitsBase should be replaced with TStructOpsTypeTraitsBase2<T>, where T is the type that the trait is being specialized for.

* `#include "Delegates/Tuple.h"` should be replaced with `#include "Templates/Tuple.h"`.

* As TPairInitializer is now convertible to TPair, rather than TPair being constructible from TPairInitializer, types which do not correctly implement copy or move semantics by not inhibiting the compiler defaults may cause a bad state when they are inserted into a TMap or TSet.  All types used in UE4 containers should correctly define copy or move semantics.

* Any dependence on Unreal Code Analyzer should be removed from projects.

* The explicit usage of TInlineSetAllocator in any TSet and TMap should be updated to ensure that the template arguments provided result in hash sizes which are a power-of-two.

* TBoolConstant<Value> should be replaced with TIntegralConstant<bool, Value>.

* Any use of WITH_HOT_RELOAD_CTORS should be replaced with the assumption that the value is 1.

* Any use of the Use VTable Constructors .ini option should be replaced with the assumption that the value is true.

* Use of generated FName variables for UFUNCTIONs (e.g. ENGINE_ReceiveTick) should be replaced with a string literal or a custom static FName variable in your own code:

    * For example: static const FName ENGINE_ReceiveTick = TEXT("ReceiveTick");

* If Unreal Header Tool reports an error about a function having a different signature from a base class, it should be fixed to have the same signature, or renamed.

#### Editor and Tools

* Exposed Make Property Combo Box in Property Customization Helpers to allow embedding an enum combo box into Struct Customizations.

* Added Custom Column support to the Asset Picker Config.

* If you use a protected platform, your project settings will start to be saved under MyGame\Config\Platform\PlatformEngine.ini, instead MyGame\Config\DefaultEngine.ini.

#### Platforms

* Made some big Device Profile changes, particularly for the protected platforms. You may need to modify your Device Profiles in similar ways if you are a heavy user of them.

    * Changed the "type" of some DPs from WindowsNoEditor, etc to Windows. It should be a platform, not a random string.

    * With that change, the platform can be used to save out protected platform DP .ini files to subdirectories, maintaining secrecy.

    * When saving DeviceProfiles, you may need to look in a platform subdirectory for the <Platform>DeviceProfiles.ini file.

    * Added  Config/[PlatformName]/ConfidentialPlatform.ini files so that the DP loading code knows to look in their directories for DPs. See the GetConfidentialPlatforms() function in GenericPlatformMisc for more information.

#### Programming

* The TargetRules.ShouldUseSharedBuildEnvironment() function has been deprecated. Targets can now specify the build environment they wish to use by setting BuildEnvironment to TargetBuildEnvironment.Default/Shared/Unique in their constructor instead.

* The constructor for ModuleRules-derived classes in .build.cs files should be updated to take a ReadOnlyTargetRules instance, which should be forwarded to the base class. This class contains the same properties as the previous TargetInfo argument, plus all the target-specific settings previously stored in the global BuildConfiguration and UEBuildConfiguration classes. Compatibility shims for accessing these objects will be removed in a future release. The WITH_FORWARDED_MODULE_RULES_CTOR preprocessor definition is now defined, which allows writing code which is compatible with multiple engine versions.

* The TargetRules.SetupBinaries() callback has been deprecated. Instead of overriding this, targets may override the launch module through the "LaunchModuleName" property in their constructor, and add extra modules to the "ExtraModuleNames" field on the TargetRules object itself.

#### Rendering

* UE4Editor is whitelisted for Aftermath with latest Nvidia drivers.  To whitelist other game executables contact Nvidia.

* RHICmdList.Clear() methods are now removed; please use RHICmdList.SetRenderTargetsAndClear() or the DrawClearQuad() utility function from ClearQuad.h.

* The Cross Compiler Tool is now removed from the Engine, it had too many limitations. Use hlslcc.sln or ShaderCompileWorker -directcompile instead.

* PipelineStateCache.h contains the new replacement interface for BoundShaderStateCache.h. Otherwise, during the Geometry rendering passes the previously introduced Draw Render State is used to collect and set the Blend, Raster, and Depth Stencil State. Commit Graphics Pipeline State will set the PSO for geometry rendering passes. Postprocessing passes or passes which use Globalshaders have to fill out a Graphics Pipeline State Initializer and set this instead.

* If configuring via .ini files, use the new variable name "ScaleTexturesByGlobalMipBias" where "ScaleTexturesByGlobalMyBias" was used.

* Mobile:  Skylights on mobile projects may need to be recaptured in the editor before packaging.

* Mobile:  Please replace r.TonemapperFilm=1 cvar with r.Mobile.TonemapperFilm=1 in case you want to use new filmic tonemapper on Mobile platforms.

#### VR

* PSVR MotionController tracking management system.

    * Blueprint functions added to manage the set of actively motion tracked controllers in MotionTrackedDevice Function Library.

    * You are recommended to disable tracking of all controllers first, and then enable tracking for the controllers you want to have tracked based on user setting, connected controllers, etc.  The system keeps a memory of which controllers are set to be tracked even if the controller is disconnected, or not yet connected.

* Experimental preview of PSVR Social Screen support.

    * The new Morpheus plugin project setting Enable Social Screen Separate Mode must be set to true to use this feature.  When that is true additional render and output buffers will be allocated for the Social Screen.

    * Blueprint functions for controlling the feature can be found by searching for 'SocialScreen'.

    * Future work will replace this API with a more flexible cross platform one, and pursue optimizations of SocialScreen output.
