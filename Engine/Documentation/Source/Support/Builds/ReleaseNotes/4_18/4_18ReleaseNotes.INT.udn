## What's New

From desktop to mobile in virtual reality or augmented reality, Unreal Engine 4.18 gives you the tools to **deliver the types of content users demand**. With expanded and improved platform support, you can **deliver content wherever users consume it**. In our relentless pursuit of a more efficient and streamlined development process, we continue to make updates and improvements to all of our tools so that you can **deliver content faster than ever before**. 

With new lighting features like Volumetric Lightmaps and multi-bounce indirect lighting from Skylights, your worlds can achieve a greater sense of realism and believability. You can even bring the real world into yours with the new Media Framework features that enable real-time compositing. Or, build your world on top of the real world for the ultimate in immersion using Apple's ARKit and Google's ARCore.

Your potential audience is constantly evolving and getting content from new and different platforms. Unreal Engine 4.18 puts your content on every major platform with greater fidelity and higher performance than ever before. We made the desktop forward renderer available on recent iOS devices to enable high quality mobile and AR content that runs blazing fast. WebAssembly is now the default for HTML 5 projects so you can create complex games for the web that load quickly and run smoothly.

Unreal Engine 4.18 enables you to focus your time on the things that matter most. With the new global *Find in Blueprints* search functionality, you'll never waste time looking for something in multiple Blueprints ever again. We have also added improved Clothing tools, a new Physics Asset Editor, and advanced Material Editor preview support along with a host of other quality of life improvements that significantly speed up the development process.

In addition to **hundreds of updates** from Epic, this release includes **98 improvements** submitted by the incredible community of Unreal Engine developers on GitHub! Thanks to each of these contributors to Unreal Engine 4.18:

## Major Features 

### New: Volumetric Lightmaps

The new Volumetric Lightmaps enable high quality lighting on movable objects from low cost precomputed lighting! Characters, particle systems, instanced foliage, and other dynamic objects appear more grounded to the environment than ever before.

![image alt text](image_0.jpg)(w:500 convert:false)  ![image alt text](image_1.jpg)(w:500 convert:false)

Volumetric Lightmaps store precomputed lighting at all points in space by covering the entire Lightmass Importance Volume with 4x4x4 bricks of lighting samples.  Bricks are placed with higher density near static geometry, where indirect lighting is changing the most.  This data structure allows efficient interpolation of indirect lighting to any point in space on the GPU. The Volumetric Lightmap is interpolated to each pixel instead of once for the whole component and has more reliable detail than our previous Indirect Lighting Cache method, resulting in fewer cases of light leaking.

For more information and details on using Volumetric Lightmaps in your project, see the [Volumetric Lightmaps documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/latest/INT/Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/VolumetricLightmaps/index.html).

**Precomputed lighting on Volumetric Fog**

Volumetric Fog now interpolates precomputed lighting to each voxel using Volumetric Lightmaps.  This enables Indirect Lighting from Stationary lights - which is stored in lightmaps - to affect fog. Static and Emissive lights affect fog without costing anything, since they're all merged into the Volumetric Lightmap.

![image alt text](image_2.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

Skylights are also now shadowed properly, preventing indoor areas from becoming over-fogged.

[/REGION]
[REGION:caption]
*1 - Skylight on fog is shadowed properly, 2 - Uniform skylight on fog has leaking*
[/REGION]

**Performance**

* Volumetric Lightmaps on a third person character cost .02ms of GPU time on PlayStation 4.  All Indirect Lighting Cache Rendering thread cost is removed. 

* Memory usage in Paragon's Monolith map went from 5Mb with the Indirect Lighting Cache up to 30Mb with Volumetric Lightmaps at default DetailCellSize settings.  Memory usage can be seen under 'stat memory'.

**Detailed Comparison**


| Volumetric Lightmap | Precomputed Light Volumes / Indirect Lighting Cache |
| --- | --- |
| Efficient interpolation on GPU | Costly interpolation on CPU |
| Per-pixel interpolation | Per-object interpolation, even on instanced components |
| Applied to Volumetric Fog | Cannot affect Volumetric Fog |
| Placed with high density around all static surfaces | Placed with high density only on top of static surfaces, frequent leaking from low density samples |
| Border voxels are stretched to cover area outside Importance Volume | Black indirect outside Importance Volume |
| Does not currently support level streaming | Supports level streaming |

### New: Improved Static Skylight Directionality

Skylights used to be represented to Lightmass with a third order Spherical Harmonic, which didn't capture the detail present in a sunrise or sunset.  We are now using a filtered cubemap with much higher resolution by default.  Lightmass chooses the appropriate mip of the cubemap based on the size of the Final Gather rays to avoid aliasing.  You can see the most difference in heavily occluded scenes, with a skylight cubemap that has a lot of brightness and color variation.

[REGION:caption]
*1 - New filtered cubemap Static Skylight, 2 - Original Static Skylight*

The smaller the opening, the more directional sky lighting will become.  It is even possible to recreate a pinhole camera effect with a small enough opening.

[/REGION]

### New: Multi-bounce Indirect Lighting from Skylights

We now have support for multiple indirect lighting bounces from static and stationary Skylights through a new 'Num Sky Lighting Bounces' setting in World Settings -> Lightmass.  Thanks to forum user [Luoshuang](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/rendering/112827-lightmass-multi-bounced-sky-lighting) for the first implementation of this feature.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_5.gif)(w:1000)
[/REGION]
[REGION:caption]
*1 - Multiple skylight bounces, 2 - Single skylight bounce*
[/REGION]

Your materials need to have a high diffuse value for multiple skylight bounces to be noticeable in most cases.  For example, with a diffuse value of .18 (18% grey), the second skylight bounce will only contribute .18^3 = .006 of the light's emitted energy which is very subtle.  With a diffuse value of .5, the second skylight bounce will contribute .125 of the light's emitted energy and be noticeable.

As a bonus we also get multiple bounces from Emissive meshes:

![image alt text](image_6.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

Lightmass uses a Radiosity Solver to compute multiple bounces for Skylights and Emissive meshes.  Each bounce increases non-distributable build times, so use with care.

### New: Apple ARKit iOS 11 Support

Unreal Engine 4.18 includes production-ready support for Apple’s ARKit in iOS 11 based on our collaborations with partners for Apple’s keynote announcing the iPhone 8 and iPhone X.

![image alt text](image_22.png)(w:1000 convert:false) 

![image alt text](image_23.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

We’ve streamlined workflows making use of existing framework components, added robust handling of the passthrough camera, and increased fidelity by improving performance and prediction.

**Note: **There have been significant changes since the experimental support for ARKit in Unreal Engine 4.17. ARKit projects created using 4.17 will require updating to work in 4.18.[Download the updated ARSample project](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine/HostForForums/ARSample_418-2abf8bda292aec0b6c9b419084d9433b0c454317.zip) to see what's changed for 4.18.

**Getting started**

Getting started in now super easy. All you need to do is:

1. Enable the appropriate ARKit plugin for your project.

2. Check the bStartInAR property in Project Settings.

3. Make sure you have a Pawn with a CameraComponent.

**Known ARKit Issues**

* Device rotation is not fully supported yet. At the moment you should select Landscape Right as the only supported orientation for your project.

* The only exposed function for hit-testing is HitTestAtScreenPosition_TrackingSpace. This returns the results in the CameraComponent's parent's space. In the default setup, that is the Pawn's space. To translate to world space we currently need to multiply the result by the parent's (e.g. Pawn's) world transform.

* The function HitTestAtScreenPosition_TrackingSpace ignores the Types parameter; it will always hit-test against all the available surfaces and return results that can be manually filtered by checking the Types field of the FAppleARKitHitTestResult struct.

* FAppleARKitHitTestResult does not populate the Anchor property; it is always nullptr.

* World Scale is currently assumed to be default, and cannot be changed.

### New: Google ARCore Developer Preview Support

Unreal Engine 4.18 contains official support for Google's ARCore developer preview which takes advantage of common augmented reality functionality in the engine and features improved handling of the passthrough camera.

### SteamVR Support on Mac

We're happy to announce that as of 4.18, UE4 officially supports VR on Mac through SteamVR! All the same interfaces that you're used to on the PC are available on the Mac, so it's easy to transfer your project to Mac to give it a spin. The update comes alongside support for Metal 2 and many other runtime optimizations. Update to the latest release of SteamVR and give it a try!

### New: Clothing Tools 

We have added a completely revamped toolset for creating and configuring clothing in the Skeletal Mesh Editor!

There is now a Clothing pane for editing an expanded set of clothing-specific properties that provide more control over clothing constraints, self collision vertex culling, inertia scaling. Enhanced paint tools enable painting per-vertex clothing parameters directly on the mesh. The new paint tools include: Brush, Gradient, Smooth, Fill. Painted parameters can be switched out instead of overwriting to aid iteration.

The clothing tools have been Integrated with Physics Assets for collision authoring. A new LOD pipeline for creating and replacing simulation meshes in a Clothing Data object that includes a parameter mapping system for mapping your painted parameters onto new LODs or replacement geometry which estimates lower detail LOD parameters from higher detail LOD parameters! It is also much easier to create clothing data in the Skeletal Mesh Editor by right clicking the mesh section to convert.

This is in addition to all of the smaller bugfixes and improvements highlighted while the tool was experimental / early access.

**Note:** APEX file import still available for those preferring a DCC pipeline

### New: Media Framework Improvements

Media Framework in 4.18 has been significantly updated and extended to support upcoming advanced use cases, such as **real-time video compositing**, time synchronization, simplified workflows, capture hardware & video-over-IP support, online media streaming, integration with Unreal Editor, and improved stability and performance!

[OBJECT:EmbeddedVideo]

	[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]



The Media Framework API has been streamlined to improve compile times and updated to make use of modern features in C++11. In addition, high-level media player logic has been refactored from a push-based paradigm to a pull-based methodology and moved into reusable Engine-agnostic classes that enables better separation of concerns in media player interfaces.

Latency and Performance is improved due to a timecode-based sample processing pipeline with high-frequency ticking for time-sensitive samples - such as audio, camera tracking, and face tracking - and multi-stage ticking that can be used by any object for better frame utilization and predictable timing.

Audio playback is now integrated with new Audio Mixer API and makes use of new Media Sound Components (replaces Media Sound Waves) that are built on top of Synth Components which can be attached to level actors and used in UMG widgets. Media sample rate converter (previously supported only 16-bit @ 44.1kHz) now supports int8, int16, int32, float, double input samples and any sample rate (including variable rates) with up to 8 audio input channels and 1 and 2 output channels (surround sound is scheduled for 4.19). Spatial audio is also supported via Media Sound Components on Actors

On the video side, Media Framework now uses an external texture sampler API which enables video frame rendering without memory copies. This is currently only implemented for Android, but we plan to expand it to other platforms. We replaced problematic triple-buffering mechanism with sample queues and added better support for exotic video and pixel formats, and faulty encoders. 

The Media Player Editor has been updated with a new Track format selector menu, audio/video capture device selector, cache state visualization (for player plug-ins that support it), Playlist controls, and the ability to save playlists. In addition, scrubbing is now more responsive and information overlays have been improved. There is also experimental support for text overlay visualization and 360 video viewport controls. Per-platform media player overrides for Media Source assets are also now functional.

Blueprint functionality has been added for querying media player tracks and track formats, enumerating audio, video and webcam capture devices, and adding files and URLs to media playlists.

All media player plugins have been updated to enable support for all of the dramatic new features available in the Media Framework in Unreal Engine 4.18.

**Note:** Some of this work, such as Sequencer integration, stereoscopic & 360 video support, and hardware accelerated 4K playback is still under active development.

### New: Sequencer Improvements

We made several 'quality of life' improvements to Sequencer including:

* Improved FBX import by adding the ability to import static/default transforms, add cinematic cameras if a corresponding camera doesn't exist in the map, and the option to force front x axis

* More efficient track, keyframe and path trajectory drawing. Overlapping keys now draw with a red border.

* Editing tools including slip editing for audio, skeletal animation, shot tracks.

### New: Improved Physics Asset Editor

The Physics Asset Editor (formerly known as PhAT) has been completely overhauled to significantly improve usability and expand functionality! The UI has a new look and feel with an upgraded Skeleton Tree view that provides better filtering and display of all scene elements and a new Graph view for setting up constraints between bodies visually using nodes. You can even set up of loops of constraints - something that was not possible before.


![image alt text](image_7.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

UI elements have been sanitized. Many things have moved or changed to more logical locations. For example, the Show menu now allows access to animation-related settings like in the Animation Editors. Animations can now be chosen at any time, paused, scrubbed etc. (previously this was only available once simulation had started). Simulation can also be engaged and disengaged at any time while animating and works in a similar way to the Level Editor, with a single prominent "Simulate" button and options underneath..

Additional Updates and Improvements:

* Time dilation works with animation and physics together and is quickly set in the viewport menu, like in the Animation Editors. 

* Recording is now controlled from the transport controls like in other Animation Editors.

* Physical animation and constraint profiles have a revamped UI. This allows easy selection, assignment and management of constraint and physics profiles.

* Constraint & body mode are no more. We now display constraints and bodies together. Rendering of each can be enabled/disabled and filtered in the tree view & viewport.

* New body creation has been moved to a new 'Tools' tab instead of the modal dialog we had before. This improves iteration times on new assets, removing 3 clicks each time. The same widget is re-used when we create new Physics Assets, as before.

* Physics Assets can now be created directly from the Content Browser. Previously they could only be created from a hidden context menu option of Skeletal Mesh assets.

* Operations that can be performed on bodies/constraints are now in all context menus, in addition to the keyboard shortcuts required previously.

### New: Multi-Convex Generation for Physics Asset Bodies

You can now auto-generate physics bodies using multiple convex hulls per bone. This allows non-convex geometry to be approximated using multiple convex hulls.

[REGION:raw]
![image alt text](image_8.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

### New: Animation Montage Time Stretch Curve

You can now add a Time Stretch Curve track to an Animation Montage to control the play rate! This enables you to maintain the normal playback speed of your Montage while selectively slowing other parts of the Montage. For example with the Time Stretch Curve, you can author just a single attack animation and control and optimize its looks for a great range of playback times.

To use the Time Stretch Curve, create a Float Curve named MontageTimeStretchCurve in your Montage and add keys to define your curve. If you need a bit more control, you can use the Time Stretch Curve properties inside the Asset Details panel to determine how the curve is sampled as well as for debugging purposes, inspect the number of markers created under the hood.


### New: RigidBody Anim Node Improvements

The RigidBody node now supports a root bone simulation space option. This is useful for the case where an attached Skeletal Mesh is counter rotated from a player capsule. We've also exposed inertia scaling and constraint dominance in the Physics Asset Editor which greatly improves stability and jitter.

### New: Global Find in Blueprints

It is now possible to perform a "Find in All Blueprints" search without also requiring a Blueprint Editor window to be open. Up to 4 global “Find in Blueprints” tabs can now remain open and/or docked in a different window at any time. These are now available in the main “Window” menu.

	[/PARAMLITERAL]
[/OBJECT]


In the Blueprint Editor menu, choosing Edit->Find in Blueprints (or pressing CTRL-SHIFT-F with the Blueprint Editor window in focus) will also now open a new global Find in Blueprints tab (or switch to the first global tab that's open and unlocked). This tab will remain open even after the Blueprint Editor's window is closed if the tab is open or docked somewhere outside of the Blueprint Editor's window.

The global Find in Blueprints tab also includes a Lock button so that the current set of results can be locked to the current tab. Invoking Edit->Find in Blueprints from the Blueprint Editor will open up a new global Find in Blueprints tab if any of the currently-open tab(s) are locked.

Choosing Edit->Find (or pressing CTRL-F) in the Blueprint Editor menu will still open a local Find Results tab for performing a search within the current Blueprint only. Clicking the "Find in all Blueprints" button will allow you to perform the same search over all Blueprint assets in a global Find in Blueprints tab.

The new behavior can be switched off if necessary by unchecking the option titled "Host Find in Blueprints in Global Tab" in Editor Preferences->Blueprint Editor->Workflow. 

### New: Improved Cross-level Actor References

Cross-level Actor references are now better supported using Soft Object References, which were previously called Asset IDs/AssetPtrs. If you create a Soft Object Reference property pointing to an Actor, they now have an improved UI that will show rather they are unloaded or broken, as well as the full Actor ID they point to:

![image alt text](image_14.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

Cross level references like this will now correctly be fixed up if the referenced Actor is renamed or moved using the "Move to current level" option. It will attempt to check out and resave any other levels/sequences that point to that specific Actor. It will also warn you before deleting Actors that are referenced in this way. They also now work correctly in Play In Editor with level streaming. Newly created Sequencer Actor references are now Soft Object References, but older Sequences will have to be fixed up with "Rebind Possessable References" and resaved first.

**Note:** As part of this update, the native types FStringAssetReference and TAssetPtr were renamed to FSoftObjectPath and TSoftObjectPtr.

### New: In-Editor Localization Preview

We have added the ability to preview your game's localization when Play in Editor (PIE) is running and in the UMG editor to preview widgets in different languages!

[/OBJECT]

* This is configured by the "Preview Game Culture" setting ("Editor Preferences" -> “Region & Language”), and will automatically be active when Play in Editor (PIE) is running. The preview language is also passed to any standalone games that are launched via the editor.

* While a preview is running, all editable text fields are locked-down (read-only) to prevent accidentally overwriting source data with translation data. You can also use this new lock-down feature to prevent any localization changes in your project  by setting "LockLocalization" to "True" under the "Internationalization" section of either your DefaultGame.ini or DefaultEngine.ini configuration files.

### New: Array Reordering

You can now drag and drop elements to reorder them within an array! All arrays set up through Blueprints and C++ are reorderable by default. To opt out of the default behavior and create a fixed order array in C++, use the EditFixedOrder metadata.

### New: Visual Studio Code Supported on Windows, Mac and Linux

You can now use Visual Studio Code to write code on all UE4 host platforms. To use it, select "Visual Studio Code" as your preferred IDE from the editor preferences dialog, or add the -vscode argument when generating project files on the command line. All platforms are also required to have the .NET Core 2.0 runtimes installed, which can be obtained from the [Microsoft .NET Core website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core).

To use Visual Studio Code to build and debug all project types, some additional extensions are required. On all platforms, make sure the Microsoft C/C++ extension, and the C# extension are installed. On Linux and Mac, the "Mono Debug" extension is required to debug C# projects, and the “LLDB Debugger” extension is required to debug C++ projects. Also, in order to debug C# projects, the mono runtime must be installed:

* On OS X: *brew install mono*

* On Linux: *sudo apt-get install mono-complete*

### New: Simplified iOS certificates and signing

When using the remote toolchain to build iOS on a remote Mac from your PC, the certificate and provisioning setup in from the Project Settings on your PC. This means it's no longer necessary to install your private key or certificates using Keychain Access on the remote Mac.

### New: Desktop-Class Forward Renderer on iOS(Experimental)

Unreal Engine 4.18 contains the Desktop-class Forward Renderer used in the Wingnut AR demo at WWDC 2017! It is supported on iOS devices with an A9 or later processor running iOS 10.3 or newer, with an A10X or better running iOS 11 strongly recommended.

![image alt text](image_16.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

This rendering technology brings the same support physically based shading, reflections, lighting, and shadowing to the latest iOS devices. These features are more demanding than the existing mobile renderer on the hardware and are experimental so some features may not function correctly on all devices & OS revisions. The following features are known not to work: GPU skin-cache, GPU morph-targets, Atmospheric Fog and Multi-Sample Anti-Aliasing.

### New: Gradle Enabled by Default for Android

Gradle is now the default for packaging Android APKs. Ant is still available if necessary by disabling the "Enable Gradle" Android project setting, but it is recommended to transition to Gradle since Ant is considered depreciated.

**Note:** If you previously did not accept the Android SDK license agreement by checking "Enable Gradle", you will need to do so by clicking on the “Accept SDK License” button in the Android Project Settings. An error will be shown if you try to package or launch on without accepting the license.

### New: Android Camera Plugin

Unreal Engine now has an optional plugin to expose access to the front and back cameras on Android devices. Enabling the plugin adds a new Android Camera plugin Project Settings panel to select Android Manifest requirements.

![image alt text](image_15.jpg)(w:550 convert:false)

### New: HTML5 Optimized Browser WebAssembly is now set to default

WebAssembly is now enabled by default for HTML5 projects. With support for the WebAssembly standard from many of the major browser makers, you can realize massive improvements on asset sizes, browser load time, and runtime performance when publishing to the web. The previous optimized HTML5 output ASM.js has been decommissioned and removed from the code base.

**Note:** Multi-threading is not yet available on WebAssembly. While ASM.js did support this, WebAssembly (for now) can only run in single threaded mode. However, multi-threading is a major feature push for all browser makers in the next coming months.

### New: LLM Low Level Memory Tracker

The new LLM Low Level Memory Tracker enables you to **track all memory once and only once***,* with nothing missed and nothing counted twice! 

![image alt text](image_11.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

Every allocation made by the engine or game is assigned a tag value identifying the category to which it belongs. The total of all of the categories will add up to the total amount of memory used for the game. The tags are applied using tag scope macros. Any allocation made within that scope will be given the specified tag. 

LLM stats can be viewed in game using 'stat LLM' or 'stat LLMFULL'. The current total for each tag will be shown in MB. LLM also writes out the stat values to a csv allowing the values to be graphed over time.

Due to its nature, LLM requires support to be added for each platform. Currently LLM supports PS4 and XboxOne. Windows is supported as an experimental release.

### New: Improved XGE (Incredibuild) Shader Compiler Support

We've made improvements to the XGE (Incredibuild) shader compiler, which have greatly reduced the stalling and latency seen in the old system and allow us to stream new shader jobs asynchronously into XGE.

The new system performs much more efficiently, and can greatly accelerate shader compilation in all situations, including cook on the fly, cook by the book, and iterating on shaders within the editor.

These improvements are enabled by default, but require at least Incredibuild version 8.01 or higher. The engine does a version check on startup and falls back to the legacy XGE shader compiler if a supported installation is not found. As with the old system, the XGE shader compiler itself must be enabled on the command line via "-xgeshadercompile", or by setting “r.XGEShaderCompile” to 1 in ConsoleVariables.ini.

### Unreal Audio Engine (Early Access Preview)

Development continues on the new Unreal Audio Engine. This release brings support to more platforms, an updated plugin architecture, and some exciting new features. These new Unreal Audio features should still be considered early access.  We will be focusing on performance and stability in coming releases.

Along with Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, XboxOne, and PS4; we have added support for the new Unreal Audio Engine on Nintendo Switch, Linux and HTML5. The new Unreal Audio Engine has been enabled by default for Linux. Significant fixes and improvements were also made to all the other backends first released in 4.17 and 4.16.

### Audio Plugin Architecture Improvements (New Unreal Audio Engine Only)

Audio plugins are useful for audio effects that need to *override* or *extend* core features of the audio engine. Object-based binaural source spatialization, source occlusion, and master reverb are best achieved through a much deeper integration into the core mixing engine. These effects require special audio plugin support.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_9.gif)(w:929)
[/REGION]

* Enhanced Audio Plugin architecture enabling a smoother integration for 3rd party developers wishing to override core mixing features

* Empowering projects to mix and match plugins overriding: Source Spatialization, Source Occlusion, and Reverb

* Can now swap out different plugins without restarting the Editor!

### New: Source Bus (New Unreal Audio Engine Only)

Source Buses are a powerful new feature which demonstrates the flexible routing capabilities of the New Unreal Audio Engine and allows multiple Sound Sources to send and sum into a single real-time Source.  Source Buses are derived from Sound Base which allows them to be played and utilized in the same way Sound Waves or Sound Cues are employed—whether spatialized as a 3D mix bus or as a means to maintain Source Effect persistence, Source Buses will become a invaluable tool for Audio Designers and will set the stage for exciting features in the future.

* Source Buses allow any audio source to route their audio to a 3D audio source, including other source buses (including themselves, creating a runtime Audio feedback system).

* Source Buses are a new USoundBase type, so they can be played as if they are another sound in our normal sound BP and C++ APIs, audio components, and ambient actors and can have their duration specified to become either a one-shot bus or, if specified as 0.0, will be treated as a looping source with indefinite duration.

* Source Effects and Submix Sends can be used with Source Buses like normal sound sources

* Other Sources send their audio to buses in an analogous way to Submix Sends and can opt to only send their audio to Source Buses vs. also sending their audio to Submixes.

### New Submix Effects (New Unreal Audio Engine Only)

We have updated our Synthesis Plugin with brand new time-based Submix Effects ranging from a simple Delay to a flexible computationally efficient reverb allowing you to create complex and interesting interactive spatial effects:

* **Delay**: Simple multichannel delay line that can be modulated at runtime from Blueprints. This effect simulates a simple broadcast delay on audio sent to the given submix which is running with this effect applied and can be used for sub-millisecond synchronization with animation or other gameplay systems.

* **Tap Delay**: Complex multichannel delay effect that allows for an arbitrary amount of taps ("echoes") that can be independently added, modified, and removed through a powerful Blueprint API during runtime. Each tap is parameterized by tap attenuation, tap azimuth, and tap delay.  This is useful for simulating the doppler effect, emulating early reflections, and many other delay-based mix effects.

* **Flexiverb: **Computationally inexpensive single-channel reverb algorithm optimized for maximizing echo density with as few multiplies as possible.  This effect is best suited for emulating small room reverberation on platforms where CPU resources are limited.

### Improved Attenuation Settings

We have improved Attenuation Settings with much needed attention given to clarity and organization.  Improvements include displaying Attenuation Settings according to Categories with special Edit Conditions to clarify which Attenuation Settings features are currently utilized.

### New: Refactored VR / AR Camera System

Unreal Engine 4.18 now contains a default camera implementation for both Camera Components and raw view that includes late-update automatically handled by the engine. This default camera implementation displaces itself (relative transform) equal to the real-world displacement of the device from its calibrated origin when there is a CameraComponent in the view target. As a result, the API that hardware developers have to implement has a much smaller footprint, resulting in a huge efficiency boost. 

**Note:** All existing platforms have their camera implementations stripped out and replaced by the default camera implementation.

## RELEASE NOTES

### AI

* Added a Blueprint callable function AIPerceptionComponent.SetSenseEnabled that can be used to toggle specific AI senses.

* Bug Fix: Prevent crashes if UMockTask_Log is created manually rather than via the CreateTask factory method

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in AISense_Sight processing that resulted in inconsistent frequency of "line of sight lost" reporting. Now this even should be reported only once, when sight of target is lost.

#### Behavior Tree

* Bug Fix: Prevent an ensure in UBlackboardComponent::ClearValue when called on a component with a null BlackboardAsset

#### General

* Bug Fix: Fixed UAIPerceptionSystem::GetCurrent causing a BP error when its WorldContextObject parameter is null

#### Navigation

* Bug Fix: Fixed UCrowdFollowingComponent::UpdateCachedDirections crashing when CharacterMovement is null

* Bug Fix: Fixed: bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled was not always working when reopeinig the map Fixed: Navigation Build was not clearing some mesh tiles when bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled is enabled Fixed: Streaming out a level in editor was not always updating NavMesh debug draw

### Animation

* New: TimeStretchCurve system for AnimMontages. Allows adjusting playback time of montages in a non constant way. This optional curve allows the user to determine how animation frames are influenced by play back time scaling, instead of using a constant play rate scaling. For example, with an attack animation, the strike could have zero influence (no play rate), and the recovery time could have 100% influence (most play rated). This system is entirely optional and compatible with current Montage API. You still determine desired play back time via the Play Rate parameter. Based on desired playback time, if there is a curve named 'MontageTimeStretchCurve' then, it will use the curve to determine animation frames to play based on playback time and TimeStretchCurve. Otherwise, if no curve exists, it is done using the constant supplied PlayRate.

* Added FAnimationRuntime::LerpPosesPerBone

* Added FAnimationRuntime::LerpPoses. Blends two poses together, but first pose is also storing results. To save on copying poses when not necessary. Removed individual use of ZERO_ANIMWEIGHT_THRESH, instead use FAnimWeight functions. FAnimationRuntime weight functions use FAnimWeight for consistency. (IsFullWeight was different).

* Added outline to skeletal mesh section selection.

* Changed behaviour when reimporting an Alembic Cache to ensure at least one track is ticked

* Animation Optimization: Added EMeshComponentUpdateFlag::OnlyTickMontagesWhenNotRendered to only update montages when not rendered, instead of doing a whole pose update. This means on dedicated servers we'll only update montages when needed, and not the AnimGraph, which we have no need for. This is also affects non rendered meshes on clients.

* Added short dummy bones to end effectors to prevent their rotations from being too aggressively compressed.

* Fixed broken 'ComputeCompressionError' with additive animations. Optimized 'ComputeCompressionError' by caching bone indices, so they don't have to be looked up every frame. Added CompressCommandletVersion INDEX_NONE to bypass DDC and test locally recompression.

* RemoveLinearKey optimizations from licensee submission: https://udn.unrealengine.com/questions/167344/animation-compression-doesnt-scale-well.html

* More Anim Compression Fixes: - Fixed frame->error bug in FAnimationUtils::ComputeCompressionError resulting in incorrect compression error measurement, and in some rare animations not being able to find a suitable compressor. - Make sure automatic compression actually go through all the compressors. - Removed unused reduction based on retargeting settings.

* Automatic Compression fixes. - Error reporting: normalize rotations and added ensures to make sure NaNs do not sneak in there. - switched size reporting from 32 to 64 bits, so we have enough space for large recompression jobs. - fixed compression ratio to be accurate. Measures actual compressed animation data instead of whole asset size. - prevented infinite loop when trying to recompressed a failed automatic compression. - Fixed reporting when no suitable compressors were found. - Compression ratio is now against uncompressed raw size, and not (trivially) compressed raw size. - Force recompression if data we got back from DDC is invalid.

* Bug Fix: SkelMeshComponent LOD update only refreshes transforms when rendered. If AnimGraph eval is done, make sure Graph has been updated at least once.

* Bug Fix: SkeletalMeshComponent::InitAnim - Do not call RefreshBoneTransforms without calling TickAnim first. AnimGraph could get in a bad state. - Do not call RefreshBoneTransforms if AnimInstance has not been initialized. - Do not call RefreshBoneTransforms if bUseRefPoseOnInitAnim is set. Which it could if bForceReinit was false.

* Bug Fix: Fixed animation curves not correctly being updated to post process instances.

* Bug Fix: Removed deprecated FTAlphaBlend class and AlphaBlendType.h header

* Bug Fix: Marked UAnimInstance as Within=SkeletalMeshComponent since it assumes the outer in various places

* Bug Fix: Fix FPoseDataContainer::Shrink bug while LocalSpacePoseMask already contains Tracks.Num() data before SetNumZeroed.

* Bug Fix: Fixed issue with Animation Sequence bounds imported from an Alembic Cache including the origin

#### Animation Assets

* This allows you to link curve to MaxLOD, where the lowest LOD (as 0 is highest) is [0, MaxLOD]. If your MaxLOD is 1, it will be only evaluate from [0, 1]. You can't disable LOD 0 this way, but if you want to disable curve, use USkeletalMeshComponent.bAllowAnimCurveEvaluation

* Cleaned up animation compression logging (change to compression category and downgraded from warning)

* -Added option to state machine to allow it to skip reinitialization when it becomes relevant -Added option to slot nodes to keep source pose relevant while montage slot is playing.

* Bug Fix: Fix for the bug: when montage is interrupted after it starts to BlendOut neither Completed pin no Interrupted pin is executed.

* Bug Fix: Fix playrate not being calculated correctly when 2 samples use the same animation

* Bug Fix: Add curve evaluation to aim offset blendspaces

* Bug Fix: Correct root motion extraction on anim composites and montages with more than one segment

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash in compression code when cropping animations in editor.

#### Animation Blueprint

* New:

    * Two Bone IK and FABRIK uses FBoneSocketTarget that supports bone and socket

    * Created new detail customizaton for FBoneSocketTarget that can display bone and socket together.

* Multiple APIs are exposed in SkeletalMeshComponent to control Animation Curves handling either to enable/disable/reset.

    * void SetAllowAnimCurveEvaluation(bool bInAllow);

    * bool GetAllowedAnimCurveEvaluate() const { return bAllowAnimCurveEvaluation; }

    * void AllowAnimCurveEvaluation(FName NameOfCurve, bool bAllow);

    * void ResetAllowedAnimCurveEvaluation();

    * void SetAllowedAnimCurvesEvaluation(const TArray<FName>& List, bool bAllow);

* Re-organized AnimBlueprint menu, so that it prioritize showing up anim node Two Bone IK.

* Added more descriptive pin name and node text for constraint node

* Improved root motion extraction performance by storing it on the anim instance during post update to avoid waiting on the parallel eval task later on.

* Bug Fix: Fixed inconsistent animation entries in Blueprint context menu (displaying differently depending on whether the asset is loaded) and cached correct tooltip when asset isn't loaded

* Bug Fix: Fixed compilation errors when nativizing animation Blueprints that use subinstances

#### Animation Blueprints

* Bug Fix: Fixed debug link for animation Blueprints not persisting when changing preview mesh

* Bug Fix: Fixed incorrect reporting of animation Blueprint fast path caused by compilation manager

#### Animation Tools

* Bug Fix: Prevented actors & components of anim preview scenes (and the preview scenes themselves) from persisting after editors are shut down

* Bug Fix: Assets with no preview mesh now no longer allow access to other skeleton's physics assets in their shortcut bars

* Bug Fix: Undo/redo now correctly affects animation preview scene settings

* Bug Fix: Fix crash with Retargeting Manager: Auto Mapping.

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when deleting notifies while the mouse was moving on top of the notify.orion

#### General

* Bug Fix: Changed SmartNames FindUID API to return UID rather than pointer to UID.

* Bug Fix: Fixed multiple calls to FinalizeBoneTransforms when calling RefreshBoneTransforms outside of tick

* Bug Fix: Fixed root motion when using ForceAnimRate's of more than 1

#### Skeletal Mesh

* Bug Fix: Fixed insert/delete/duplicate button not appearing for bones within the "Bones to Remove" setting of the Skeletal Mesh editor.

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when reloading mesh asset that are used by animation editor.

* Bug Fix: Fix for USkinnedMeshComponent::GetCPUSkinnedVertices() failing in shipping config on platforms that supported GPU skinning (Contributed by Koderz)

#### Tools

* New: Improved discover-ability for Blend Space Editor features

* Break up Live Link plugin so that the client can run in cooked builds too

* Bug Fix: Fixed BlendSpace editor preview (holding Control) when it doesn't have focus.

* Bug Fix: Fixed issue with BlendSpace editor where new samples list would not regenerate BlendSpace sampling.

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when performing drag operations in the notify track window

* Bug Fix: Notify windows now stay up to data across multiple editors when adding notifies to an animation.

* Bug Fix: Fixed Bake Pose functionality not working correctly if the Root Bone of the Skeleton contained any transformations

### Audio

* New: Spatialization, Reverb, and Occlusion plugin support has been significantly improved. It now supports per platform mix and match of plugins. Audio plugins can now also be swapped out without closing the editor.

* New:

    * Cleaning up Attenuation Settings UI.

    * Breaking up attenuation settings into categories.

    * Added edit condition so only editable if attenuation settings are overridden in audio components or sound cues.

    * Adding ability for audio plugins to indicate if they have custom settings. Allows hiding settings in attenuation settings.

    * Cleaning up reverb send code and updated attenuation settings.

    * Added custom reverb send curve support.

    * Added default stereo spread of 200 for attenuation settings.

    * Added ability to do a normalization for stereo spatialized sound sources (to avoid clipping when spread is

    * Added ability to apply a HPF to a sound source based on distance for audio mixer and added that option to attenuation settings if audio mixer is enabled.

* New:

    * Source buses allow any audio source to route their audio to a 3d audio sources.

    * Source buses can be routed to other source buses (including themselves).

    * Source buses are a new USoundBase type, so can be played as if it was another sound in our normal sound BP and C++ APIs, audio components, and ambient actors.

    * Buses can have their duration specified to become a 1-shot bus or, if specified as 0.0, will be treated as a looping source (i.e. indefinite duration).

    * Source effects and submix sends can be used with buses like normal sound sources.

    * Other sources send their audio to buses in an analogous way to submix sends and can opt to only send their audio to buses vs also sending their audio to submixes.

    * Fundamental architectural feature allows sources to be mixed into 3d buses which allow persistence of source effect state between instances of other sources and opens up the possibility for a number of other exciting features.

* New: The new Unreal Audio Engine now supports HTML5.

* New Submix Effect added: Tap Delay. The Tap Delay submix effect allows you to add any general number of taps ("echoes") and control them independently, both ahead of time and at runtime using Blueprint functions. This can be used to emulate the doppler effect, simulate early reflections, and more.

* Added ability to pass in an owner to PlaySound2D and PlaySoundAtLocation BP functions so they can be used with concurrency limits that are limited to owners.

* Allowing launching audio to HMD audio device with -VR in non-editor builds.

* Moved setting a default reverb send level for audio mixer master reverb to audio settings.

* Moving the synth component initialize to before audio component attachment is setup.

* Adding code to not update filter parameters unless the parameters have changed.

* Adding utility function to get a log-frequency value from a linear value.

* Don't send or mix built-in reverb submix if there's a plugin reverb enabled.

* Added Blueprint functions to the Sound Utilities plugin: GetBeatTempo. GetFrequencyFromMIDIPitch, GetMIDIPitchFromFrequency, and GetPitchScaleFromMIDINote.

* Added a new submix effect to the Synthesis library: Flexiverb.
Flexiverb is a computationally inexpensive single-channel reverb algorithm optimized for maximizing echo density with as few multiplies as possible. This effect is best suited for emulating small room reverberation on platforms where CPU resources are limited.

* Fix for allowing audio plugins to work in non-editor builds who don't support multiple audio devices for PIE.

* The new Unreal Audio engine has been refactored so that audio buffers are allocated with platform specific memory alignments.

* Adding attack and decay interpolation times for focus feature to avoid fast sweeps of focus.

* Optimization in converting procedural audio buffers to 16 bit PCM.

* New submix effect in the Synthesis library: Delay. This effect is a simple multichannel delay line that can be adjust at runtime.

* Bug Fix: Using audio thread platform affinity mask for audio render thread in audio mixer.

* Bug Fix: Fixing a crash in Ngs2 when initializing a source from the Ngs2 rack that is still being stopped from its previous lifetime.

* Bug Fix: Fix for incorrect spatialization of audio sources on iOS using legacy audio engine.

* Bug Fix: Implemented basic handling for audio device hotswap. This will solve the issue of the UE4 editor hanging when an audio device is unplugged from the system. However, please note that any audio sources played via source or Blueprint will be stopped when this happens.

* Bug Fix: Audio: Fix case where audio is already set to be a preview sound. Sequencer sets the sound to be a preview sound when scrubbing in editor.

* Bug Fix: Streaming audio on MacOS and iOS in the audio mixer is now fixed.

* Bug Fix: Fixed Platform Headroom levels for Android.

* Bug Fix: Fixing parameter interpolation in the audio mixer.

* Bug Fix: Fixing thumbnail generation on sound file reimport.

* Bug Fix: Fix for sound submix graph recursion.

### Automation

* Add individual FTest enumeration to perf tests Moved methods to run FTests to helper for reuse. Effects perf tests now show individual test cases for more granular runs. All perf tests now do map check and draft logic as setup.

* Bug Fix: Fix Perforce automation routine to return files whose last action was a rename.

### Blueprints

* New: Find-in-Blueprints is now hosted in a global tab by default. This tab can remain open even if the Blueprint Editor window is closed.

* New: Added MakeMap Blueprint node.

* New: Added MakeSet Blueprint node

* Added Blueprint functions for getting vectors from cones using random streams, to complement the existing non-stream variants. For consistency, this entire family of functions have been modified and renamed to provide versions that take arguments in both degrees and in radians. See the Programmer notes for specific details.

* Blueprint input nodes for key, action, and axis can now be subclassed from other modules.

* Made the compact node title for cross and dot product the words cross and dot rather than hard to see . and x symbols

* Improved the visual styling of user disabled nodes and development-only nodes (still an experimental feature, but this is a step towards removing that label)

* Made it easier to pick a specific actor in the level as the Blueprint instance to debug by adding "(selected)" after the label in the 'debug filter' dropdown in the Blueprint editor

* Allow adjusting the font size for each individual comment box node in Blueprint graphs (also works in Material graphs)

* Allow specifying a description for user defined enum assets (shown in the content browser)

* Allow drag-dropping component Blueprint assets into the graph to create Add Component nodes and improved the error message when dragging something that cannot be dropped into an actor Blueprint

* Added a tooltip field for each value in a user defined enum

* Added a key binding for Find References (Shift+Alt+F)

* Improved the implementation of Goto Definition, allowing any node to implement it by overriding CanJumpToDefinition or JumpToDefinition - Collapsed 'Goto Code Definition' for variables and functions into the same path, so there aren't separate menu items and commands - The default behavior for UK2Node subclasses is to call GetJumpTargetForDoubleClick and call into FKismetEditorUtilities::BringKismetToFocusAttentionOnObject - Going to a native function now goes thru a better code path that will actually put the source code editor on the function definition, rather than just opening the file containing the definition

* Added a key binding for Goto Definition (Alt+G)

* Allow 'Goto Definition' and 'Find References' to be used while stopped at a breakpoint

* Added an option to disable the comment bubble on comment boxes that appears when zoomed out

* Added the full name of the type, container type, and value type (for maps) to the tooltips for the type picker on Blueprint variables, so long names can be read in full

* No longer need to explicitly register nodes implementing UK2Node_AddPinInterface to use SGraphNodeK2Sequence

* Remove deprecated CustomMapParamValue code

* Add InRange (int) to Blueprint math library

* Added Blueprint node for swapping entries in arrays.

* KismetRenderingLibrary: Added EditorOnly Blueprint function for creating static textures from Render Targets. Has options for Mip and Compression Settings

* The VirtualReality Blueprint template is now available on Mac.

* Blueprint compilation manager now skips compilation of dependent Blueprints when no function signatures are changed. This can greatly speed up compilation of Blueprints with large numbers of dependent Blueprints

* Fixed various issues with both UAT-driven and manually-configured code/data build workflows with respect to enabling Blueprint nativization.

* Added new Editor Only Plugin called Blueprint Material Texture Nodes. This plugin adds Blueprint nodes for reading texture and render target data as well as the ability to create and modify MIC assets.

* Bug Fix: Marked a number of container functions as BlueprintThreadSafe From UDN: https://udn.unrealengine.com/questions/384561/should-map-find-be-tagged-Blueprintthreadsafe.html

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue diffing text properties/pins in Blueprints

* Bug Fix: Blueprint nodes can no longer be renamed on read-only graphs.

* Bug Fix: Fixed undo not removing pins added to make container nodes via Add Pin from the context context menu.

* Bug Fix: Compiling a Blueprint containing a child actor component will no longer mark the Blueprint of child actor's class dirty.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a runtime crash in nativized child Blueprints that include a parent function call node in a replicated function implementation.

* Bug Fix: Array shuffle node no longer uses biased shuffle algorithm.

* Bug Fix: Fixed various issues with split pins not being correctly connected when expanding macros and functions.

* Bug Fix: Fixed ensure when connecting the output pin of a create delegate node to a wildcard input.

* Bug Fix: Correctly reconnect split pins when changing class on create widget, construct object, and spawn actor nodes

* Bug Fix: Fix two compilation manager issues: Make sure CDOs are not renamed under a UClass, because they will be considered as possible subobjects, which has bad side effects and make sure that we update references even on empty functions, so that empty UFunctions are not left with references to REINST data

* Bug Fix: Prevent crashes when a loading blueprint that implement an interface that was deleted

* Bug Fix: Fixed Construct Object not working correctly with split expose on spawn pins.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an EDL assert on load in a nativized build caused by a native reference to a nativized BP class that also references a nativized UDS asset.

* Bug Fix: Fixed the tooltip when dragging a variable onto an inherited category so it shows the 'move to category' hint

* Bug Fix: Changed UK2Node::GetPassThroughPin so that only the execution wire on nodes with exactly one input and one output exec wire will have a corresponding pass-through pin (when there is ambiguity in which exec would be used, e.g., with a branch or sequence or timeline node, the subsequent nodes are now effectively disabled as well)

* Bug Fix: Changed the behavior of various things that were hard-coded to operate on the first event graph to instead operate on the most recently used event graph page

* Bug Fix: Added support for creating appropriate outers for objects that must be nested within another class during fuzzing (ones that specify Within=, other relationships aren't knowable yet)

* Bug Fix: We now prevent ConstructGenericObject nodes from compiling in a Blueprint if the selected class type does not include 'BlueprintType' in its inheritance hierarchy.

* Bug Fix: Fix for crash when attempting to access a value in an array by ref, when the array being accessed was trying to be found on a null object ref

* Bug Fix: Placing a get to an input parameter with same name as a member variable no longer creates an incorrect property reference.

### Core

* New: Support for Visual Studio Code

    * Pass "-vscode" to GenerateProjectFiles in order to create a set of task/launch/cppconfig files that can be used by Visual Studio Code to build and debug Unreal Engine projects

    * A new source code access plugin that will allow the opening of projects and source files in Visual Studio Code

* New: Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) upgraded to branch 3071 Win32/Win64/Mac. Added web browser support for foreign language character input via IME.

* Core: Various improvements to FTimespan

* Core: Added scalar division to FTimespan

* Core: Added TLruCache template for least-recently used caches

* Core: Added FTimespan::Ratio

* Changed the default sorting algorithm to intro sort. - Algo::Sort and ::Sort will call Algo::IntroSort - The sort version that was in Algo::Sort is now in Algo::LegacySort

* Added the ability to verify the DDC content is not stale. Systems have to opt in (-VerifyDDC).

* Fixed documentation comments for FName inequality operator.

* Fixed incorrect definition of DECLARE_DELEGATE_NineParams, DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE_NineParams macros.

* Added FString::ToUpper() and FString::ToLower() rvalue overloads for improved efficiency.

* Improved UnrealHeaderTool to support multiple interface definitions in a single header.

* Improved UnrealHeaderTool's error message when unsupported template parameters are provided in a TSet property.

* Improved Intellisense when generated headers are missing or out of date (eg. line numbers changed, etc...). These errors seem to be masked by VAX, but are present when using the default Visual Studio Intellisense. * UCLASS macro is defined to empty when __INTELLISENSE__ is defined. Previous macro was preventing any following class declaration being parsed correctly if generated code was out of date, causing squiggles over all class methods/variables. * Insert a semicolon after each expanded GENERATED_BODY macro, so that if it parses incorrectly, the compiler can still continue parsing the next declaration.

* Added container modification checks to ranged-for loops which are iterating over TMap, TSet and TSparseArray.

* Added code to verify compression flags in package file summary to avoid cases where corrupt packages are crashing the editor

* Added a batch file to Engine/Build/BatchFiles for detecting and running MSBuild

* Added VisitTupleElements, which calls the given functor with each element in the tuple.

* Improved UnrealHeaderTool's error message when multiple types with the same name are found.

* Changed the logic so that engine UObjects boot before anything else. The engine classes are known to be cycle-free, so we will get them done before moving onto game modules.

* UENUM enumerator initializers can now be arbitrary C++ constants, including values which are not parsed by UnrealHeaderTool (e.g. values from third party headers). However, script generator plugins will not have access to these values at script-generation time. Added support for editor-only data UENUMs. Fixed multiple MAX values being generated for UENUMs which already define a MAX.

* Logging improvements for pak signature check failures

* Split RunExternalExecutable into RunExternaNativelExecutable and RunExternalDotNETExecutable

* Added editor support for packages cooked with the Event Driven Loader enabled.

* Added validation that arguments passed to the checkf macro are valid sprintf types, and fix up a few places which are currently incorrect.

* When creating GC clusters and asserting due to objects still being pending load, the object name and cluster name will now be logged with the assert.

* Added FBase64::GetDecodedDataSize() to determine the size of bytes of a decoded base64 string

* PR #3847: Add GC callbacks for script integrations (Contributed by mhutch)

* Added support for displaying log timestamps in local time. Set LogTimes=Local in *Engine.ini, or pass -LocalLogTimes on the command line.

* Various changes to Unreal Build Tool and DotNETUtilities assemblies to help support building and executing on the .NET Core 2.0 platform

* Added ENABLE_GC_OBJECT_CHECKS macro to be able to quickly toggle UObject pointer checks in shipping builds when the garbage collector is running.

* Fixed a race condition with the async loading thread enabled caused by missing linker object.

* PR #3839: Make non-encoding specific Base64 functions accessible (Contributed by stfx)

* Moved some common C# classes into the DotNETCommon assembly

* FString::Trim() and FString::TrimTrailing() have been replaced with separate versions to mutate (TrimStartInline(), TrimEndInline()) or return by copy (TrimStart(), TrimEnd()).

* Allow the network version to be set via Build.version if it's not overriden from Version.h.

* UBT - Add a ToString to ProjectFile.Source file to help with debugger watch presentation

* Plugins may now specify a list of supported target platforms, which are propagated to any .uproject file that enables it. This has several advantages over the per-module platform whitelist/blacklist: * Platform-specific .uplugin files can now be excluded when staging other platforms. Previously, it was only possible to determine which platforms a plugin supports by reading the plugin descriptor itself. Now that information is copied into the .uproject file, so the runtime knows which plugins to ignore. * References to dependent plugins from platform-specific plugins can now be eliminated. * Plugins containing content can now be unambiguously disabled on a per-platform basis (having no modules for a platform does not confer that a plugin doesn't support that platform; now it is possible to specify supported platforms explicitly). * The editor can load any plugins without having to whitelist supported editor host platforms. UE4 targets which support loading plugins for target platforms can set TargetRules.bIncludePluginsForTargetPlatforms (true for the editor by default, false for any other target types). This defines the LOAD_PLUGINS_FOR_TARGET_PLATFORMS macro at runtime, which allows the plugin system to filter which plugins to look for at runtime. Any .uproject file will be updated at startup to contain the list of supported platforms for each referenced plugin if necessary.

* Fixed lazy object pointers not being updated for streaming sub-levels in PIE. Fixed lazy pointers returning object that is still being loaded which could lead to undefined behavior when client code started modifying the returned object.

* PR #3760: Fix typo (Contributed by jesseyeh)

* Made MoveTemp static assert when called on a const reference or rvalue, to allow inefficiencies to be tracked more easily. Added MoveTempIfPossible which follows the earlier behavior, which is still useful for templates and macros where it's unclear if the argument is valid.

* Removed the extraneous subfolder when writing out .mprof files.

* Fix non-thread safe construction of FPluginManager singleton. Length of time spent in the constructor resulted in multiple instances being constructed at startup, making the time to enumerate plugins on slow media significantly worse.

* Optimizations to SignedArchiveReader

* Improved assert message when the initial package read request was too small.

* Made max package summary size to be configurable with ini setting

* Add support for a "Mods" folder distinct from the project's "Plugins" folder, instead of using the bIsMod flag on the plugin descriptor. * Mods are enumerated similarly to regular plugins, but IPlugin::GetType() will return EPluginType::Mod. * The DLCName parameter to BuildCookRun and the cooker now correctly finds any plugin in the Plugins or Mods directory (or any subfolders).

* Added a new TArray constructor that takes a raw pointer and a count. Improved checks inside TArray::Append() to allow nullptr in empty ranges.

* UDataTable::AddReferencedObjects will no longer try to iterate over the RowMap if there's no UObject references in it.

* Custom Version Container will no longer be always constructed in FArchive constructor. This reduces the number of the Custom Version Container allocations considerably.

* Removed obsolete code for UHT makefiles.

* Moved FSimpleObjectReferenceCollectorArchive and FSimpleObjectReferenceCollectorArchive to be internal archives used only by FReferenceCollector so that they are constructed only once per GC task instead of potentially multiple times per GC (as was the case with UDataTables and BlueprintGeneratedClasses).

* Added new AllOf, AnyOf and NoneOf algorithms.

* Shrunk size of code generated by UnrealHeaderTool, around 10% of Win64 executable size.

* Deprecate /-prefixed commandline switches as they cannot be distinguished from absolute file paths on Linux/Mac.

* Bitfield properties can now be exposed on spawn.

* FName now works correctly with Lex::To/FromString.

* Added FQuat::InitFromString.

* Add ability to pass option flags to ActorIterator to enable searching non-active levels

* Moved the Hamming-weight function from StaticMeshDrawList.inl to FGenericPlatformMath Added SSE versions using _mm_popcnt_u64 for platforms that support it Added a SSE check to gracefully exit when missing the instruction and it was expected to be there

* Fixed stale modules being enumerated when running UE4Editor-Cmd.exe.

* Fix DECLARE_LOG_CATEGORY_EXTERN requiring a trailing semicolon if NO_LOGGING is defined.

* Added a packaging setting that allows the user to choose whether or not to build the game executable. Includes a setting to build the executable only if not using a promoted build ("Only if locally built editor"). The same option has to the "Play" settings in the editor. This allows developers that want to submit game binaries to Perforce to configure the engine to use it without building anything.

* Bug Fix: Core: Fixed FTimespan import/export/copypaste (UE-43990)

* Bug Fix: Fixed custom mesh component bounds being computed incorrectly.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where editor would crash when showing the property matrix and deleting one of the targeted actors.

* Bug Fix: Fix several issues with the Component Transform UI that is used for actor and component placement. Dragging to spin rotation now works better and in most cases it will correctly maintain the exact rotation entered. It now correctly displays "dirty" status and will propagate values better to inherited or instanced components.

### Gameplay Framework

* New: Cross-level Actor references are now better supported, using SoftObjectPath and SoftObjectPtr (called Soft Object Reference in Blueprints). As part of this, FStringAssetReference and TAssetPtr were renamed to FSoftObjectPath and TSoftObjectPtr.

	If you create a SoftObjectPtr property pointing to an Actor or subclass, they will have an improved UI that will show rather they are unloaded or broken, as well as the full Actor ID they point to. Cross level references like this will now correctly be fixed up if the pointed to actor is renamed or moved using the "Move to current level" option. It will attempt to check out and resave any other levels/sequences that point to that specific actor. They will also work correctly in PIE when level streaming is used.

* Draw box around Actor being debugged by 'ShowDebug' command, to help identify what we're viewing.

* Allow Scale to be set on an AnimNotify as well as the spawn emitter gameplay statics

* Add ToString Blueprint functions for SoftObjectReference/SoftClassReference/PrimaryAssetId/PrimaryAssetType to assist in debugging

* USceneComponent::ComponentToWorld has now been made private per the previous deprecation message.

* Change the way that PIE networking works so the sent paths strip the PIE prefix and restore on load. This allows connecting a PIE client/server to an external non-PIE client/server.

* Change it so Standalone PIE and multiprocess networked PIE do not save temporary levels starting with UEDPC and instead prompt the user to save. This is how Launch On works by default already, and this fixes several cross level reference and sequencer bugs.

* Added GetKeysForAxis() to complement GetKeysForAction() in UPlayerInput

* Add support for downloading Chunks on demand to the Asset Manager, if they are set up for your project. AcquireResourcesForAssetList can be used to predownload chunks, and chunks will be downloaded on demand if bShouldAcquireMissingChunksOnLoad is true in the Asset Manager Settings

* Add FCollectionReference type and customization that allows selecting a Collection in the editor. Add one to PrimaryAssetLabel so it will label all assets in a Collection

* Small optimization to CleanupActors

* Reduced memory footprint of UActorComponent, USceneComponent, UPrimitiveComponent, UMeshComponent, UStaticMeshComponent, and UParticleSystemComponent.

* UStaticMeshComponent::StaticMesh has completed being made private. Use Get/SetStaticMesh() instead.

* AHUD::GetOwningPlayerController and GetOwningPawn are now public accessors.

* Added FTransform::TransformRotation(FQuat) and FTransform::InverseTransformRotation(FQuat). Added matching Blueprint library functions taking FRotator. (Contributed by EverNewJoy).

* Bug Fix: Garbage Collection timing is no longer managed on a per World basis, but instead at the UEngine level.

* Bug Fix: Marked ULevelStreaming as Within=World, since various places already assume it

* Bug Fix: Fix several issues with loading the same asset twice in a row with Asset Manager.

* Bug Fix: All components will now clear the component need end of frame update mark when unregistered, not just primitive components.

* Bug Fix: Added GetTargetRotation() to SpringArmComponent, which returns the rotation target based on the combination of various rotation setting flags (bUsePawnControlRotation, bInheritPitch, bInheritYaw, bInheritRoll, absolute rotation flags). Use this instead of querying the SpringArmComponent's own rotation, which isn't changed at runtime.

* Bug Fix: Reduced memory churn/allocations when duplicating an Actor's components for PIE.

* Bug Fix: Fixed comment in GetComponents (UActorComponent version), which was referencing wrong component type.

* Bug Fix: Fixed issues where lighting could be unbuilt when reloading packages.

* Bug Fix: Renamed USceneComponent::bWorldToComponentUpdated to bComponentToWorldUpdated (since the transform is called ComponentToWorld).

### Networking

* New: Added experimental network encryption functionality.

    * This is handled by a new packet handler component in the AESHandlerComponent plugin.

    * This component depends on another new plugin, PlatformCrypto, which wraps basic encryption algorithms implemented either by APIs provided by the platform, or by OpenSSL.

    * Net connections and their packet handler objects are now aware of encryption components, and have new functions to allow setting the encryption key.

    * When connecting to a game server, a custom token can be exchanged. This token may be used to obtain the actual encryption key for the connection.

* UdpMessaging: Not showing warning message if tunnel settings left empty to use defaults

* Messaging: Waking up message router thread on shutdown

* Messaging: Moved common helper classes into MessagingCommon module

* Merged over the change to expose more of dormancy to Blueprints (UE-46240)

* Enable the TCPMessaging plugin on platforms other than Windows/Mac so it can be used for profiling/automation, and fix several platform-specific bugs. If this is not desired, you should disable the plugin for your project.

* Add support for -TcpMessagingListen=IP:port and -TcpMessagingConnect=IP:Port command line options to the TCP messaging layer used for automation and profiling, this allows manually connecting to specific devices

* Added some additional stat instrumentation to the low-level network replication code. This may help track down replication performance issues when viewing ue4stats files in the Profiler.

* It is now possible to configure the UDP socket buffer sizes that the IpNetDriver requests of the operating system when creating a new connection.

* Bug Fix: Networking: Fixed nullpointer crash in TcpListener if socket initialization fails

* Bug Fix: NBOSerializer security fixes to protect against possible overflow in the values

* Bug Fix: Fixed client assert when trying to send RPCs while connection is pending closure due to queued bunches. ChIndex is -1 during this time, though the channel is not actually closed. Added ensure when calling SendBunch() under this condition to catch future cases like this.

* Bug Fix: Fix issue where nonblocking BSD sockets on some platforms may return EINPROGRESS on initial connect, which should not be treated as an error

* Bug Fix: AActor::PreReplication is now called prior to RPCs when they would have triggered initial replication.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where connecting to a Server that had deleted startup actors and then unloaded their sub level would cause a crash.

* Bug Fix: Fix to update actor replication stats even when the connection is currently saturated.

* Bug Fix: APawn::IsNetRelevantFor properly checks AGameNetworkManager::bUseDistanceBasedRelevancy.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a rare issue where the data stored in network replays could be corrupted, potentially causing a crash when the replay is played back.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue when the server is paused, the clients were not getting the update that it had happened.

* Bug Fix: Changes were made to FTcpListener and FTcpMessageTransportConnection to prevent them from polling sockets in a thread while waiting for connections or data. This improves performance on Android clients when launched from the editor and should also benefit other systems using FTcpListener.

It is now sufficient to have the certificates and keys installed on the PC and configured in the IOS section of the Project Settings.

* Addition of asset catalogs for application icons on IOS 11. When utilizing Xcode 9, the build tools will now create and compile an asset catalog composed of the application icons. This catalog is required when uploading the application to the store. Users can still specify their icons in the IOS Project Settings as normal and the location of the those files has not changed. They are automatically copied in to the asset catalog at build time.

* The editor now defaults to building 64-bit only executables for iOS. This change has been made to be compatible with iOS 11 and it's 64-bit only policy. Source users can still build 32-bit executables by updating the 32-bit build variables in their configuration files.

* Bug Fix: ULevelStreamingKismet::LoadLevelInstance function is now exposed to game code

### Rendering

* New: Remove rendering support code in MetalRHI for Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11) - MetalRHI now requires macOS Sierra (10.12) to function on Mac.

* Extended ExternalTexture to support 2x3 transform (scale/rotation + offset)

* Make all Metal shader platforms compiled with Metal version 1.2 or later compile such that half may be used, unless the material specifies full precision.

* Support disabling V-Sync in MetalRHI on macOS 10.13+.

* Added a command-line option "-MetalRuntimeDebugLevel=X" (where X is a number 0-8, defined in MetalContext.cpp) to specify the amount of runtime validation of Metal operations that MetalRHI will perform over and above Xcode's validation layer. For macOS level 5 and above will attempt to emit GPU instructions such that if a command-buffer fails the error report will indicate the last successfully completed debug-group.

* HDR logic refactor - simplify enable/disable logic, particularly on console. This add a high level r.AllowHDR cvar to enable/disable HDR on a per-platform or per-title basis. (This is a breaking change, since it defaults to off.). By default, the user setting now default to true on Console. Instead, we rely on the OS to determine HDR capability

* D3D12: Enable GPU validation if -d3d12gpuvalidation is passed on the commandline

* Allow disabling of display V-Sync in Metal on macOS 10.13+ when running in true fullscreen mode (not windowed or windowed-fullscreen). This stops synchronizing frame presentation with the display, so can be slightly faster but will tear visibly as it does on all other platforms.

* Bug Fix: Fixed cloth rendering on Metal by changing the way FClothVertex is loaded. Some of the data in FClothVertex needs to be treated as uint data and loading it as floats was exposing a difference in behavior between some Metal drivers and Direct3D.

* Bug Fix: Moved RHISupportsMSAA and add the necessary conditions for when it is available on Metal (AMD & Nvidia for macOS 10.13+, Mobile Renderer for iOS).

* Bug Fix: Rework handling of various Metal intrinsics and implement a full fused-multiply-add optimization pass within hlslcc to ensure greater consistency of results between different Metal shaders motivated by changes to the behavior of Apple's Metal compiler.

* Bug Fix: Fixed iOS builds picking up the Mac's Metal shader standard setting which caused the wrong shaders to be compiled.

* Bug Fix: Fixed lighting in VR Forward rendering on Nvidia GPUs under macOS by changing how we load the ForwardLocalLightBuffer data to avoid a difference in behavior between some Metal drivers and Direct3D.

* Bug Fix: Fixed Pixel Inspector not working on Mac by implementing the missing CopySubTextureRegion function in MetalRHI.

* Bug Fix: Improve the handling of features that are restricted to certain Mac/iOS & Metal versions in Editor UI and the way the Editor handles the absence of the native Metal shader-compiler.

    * Disable half floats for Metal v1.0 & Metal v1.1 - too many shaders just don't compile anymore for no apparent reason - this will only get worse as the compiler stack advances.

    * Change the Editor code to ensure that cooking without access to the native Metal shader compiler does not pollute the DerivedDataCache for other users.

    * The global clip plane implies clip_distance support which on A8 devices requires iOS 10.

    * The Desktop Forward renderer for iOS requires Metal v1.2 and iOS 10.

* Bug Fix: Rework the error reporting for remote shader compilation so that the correct error message is actually reported when the native Metal compiler is not available.

* Bug Fix: Fix rendering of shaders that use World-Position-Offset on Metal platforms by extensive use of newer intrinsics.

* Bug Fix: Change an assert in the Metal shader translator that fires whenever a float literal is NaN or an otherwise unhandled non-finite value to a compiler warning that can be debugged as NaN/INF literals will be incorrect on all platforms.

* Bug Fix: Fix a crash when switching between normal and Mobile Preview rendering modes in the Editor on Mac.

* Bug Fix: Fix the incorrect velocity & motion-blur rendering in the Desktop Forward renderer on A8 iOS devices (e.g. iPhone 6/6+), the Desktop Forward renderer is now minimally functional on these older iOS devices but will be slow as it is much more demanding than the Mobile Renderer.

* Bug Fix: Fixed project thumbnails on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Fixed RHILockVertexBuffer on DX12 to work properly with and without RHI commandlist.

* Bug Fix: Emit only one declaration for system provided shader variables for Metal as sometimes we end up with multiple specifications for some volumetric fog shaders.

* Bug Fix: Protect against invalid copysubresource bounds. Protects against GPU crashes on some drivers.

* Bug Fix: Fix black flickering on some materials that use World Position Offset - the Metal sincos intrinsic comes into two flavours for single precision floats and we want the precise version not the fast version but only for Vertex shaders.

* Bug Fix: Fix a crash on shutdown due to MetalRHI caching vertex-declarations beyond the lifetime of the RHI by moving the cache into the FMetalDynamicRHI itself.

* Bug Fix: Fix D3D12 validation error when GBV is enabled, courtesy of Sebastian Merry at Microsoft

* Bug Fix: Avoid a Metal GPU driver bug by only emitting one clip-distance on Metal, when the global clip-plane is enabled this takes priority over all others as it is essential to function correctly, other uses are merely optimizations.

* Bug Fix: Fixed outline in editor missing on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Rebuilt IntelISPCTexComp with Visual Studio 2015 to remove dependency on VS2013 redist.

* Bug Fix: Fixed life-time fading on deferred decals.

#### Lighting

* Disable r.GenerateLandscapeGIData by default, opt-in for kite demo. Projects that want to use heightfield GI need to opt-in to r.GenerateLandscapeGIData.

* Added 'Render Unbuilt Preview Shadows in game' rendering project setting and r.Shadow.UnbuiltPreviewInGame console variable

* Swarm hands out the most expensive tasks in roughly a round robin ordering among distribution agents. Lightmass processing of a single task is multithreaded, so ideally the most expensive tasks are evenly distributed among active agents. This has the biggest impact in small scenes with 10's of high resolution lightmaps, and with a distribution farm. Build time in one scene went from to 113s -> 47s.

* Allow masked dynamic shadows to be cast by translucent materials, based on a threshold opacity value.

* Volume materials on every component type except particle sprites now voxelize the mesh's Object space bounding box, allowing more control over the shape of fog added and better performance when adding ground density.

* Bug Fix: Exposed EmissiveBoost, since Lightmass supports Emissive areas on meshes

* Bug Fix: VolumetricScatteringIntensity is greyed out based on Mobility

#### Materials

* Moved UTexture material notification code into separate function, so it can be used by derived classes.

* Improved streaming support for AO textures and lighting scenarios.
Improved resolution metrics in the texture editor.
Added a new editor command "BuildMaterialTextureStreamingData" to refresh material texture streaming data.

* Removed the 1945MB VRAM cap in DX11 and DX12 when running 64 bit builds. Non console platforms will now allocate non streaming texture outside the texture pool if there is enough free VRAM available. This improves the behavior and maintainability of low texture settings.

* Bug Fix: Fixed some cases where material instances would be treated as masked instead of opaque as intended.

* Bug Fix: Fixed behavior of custom material attribute display names and function names.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where some materials would overstream some textures.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where textures would stay at low resolution following a memory usage spike.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue when building the DDC for composite textures where the texture sources would be missing.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a case where parameters behind a static switch would be invisible in a material instance.

#### Mobile Rendering

* Exposed "Use Full Precision" for UI materials, which can be used to improve precision at performance cost in UI pixel shaders on mobile devices.

* Added support for Vulkan validation layers on Android. Only in Debug and Development configuration (requires r.Vulkan.EnableValidation=1)

* Vertex Fog is disabled on Mobile by default. This saves a number of instruction in base pass shaders.

* Bug Fix: Correct tracking of static mesh index memory.

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Decals on mobile devices should not disappear when there is planar reflection in the view

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Protostar in Vulkan mode crashes without error on Tegra K1 Nvidia Shield due to OOM - fixed r.MobileReduceLoadedMips has no effect - added r.MobileMaxLoadedMips to set a limit to a number of mips - reduced size of vulkan allocation pages on android

* Bug Fix: Fixed a problem which could cause the Scene Depth material node to return 0 on some mobile devices.

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Crash after Splash Screen on Android (ETC2) when Adding r.UseShaderCaching and r.UseShaderPredraw - Added r.SaveShaderCache command to save current cache on demand - Removed support for caching multiple platforms at the same time, each platform now uses separate cache/file - Significantly reduced size of draw log on disk - Mobile platforms support only basic caching, logging shaders and bound shader states without full gfx state

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Usage of dynamic shadows leads to application crash on Galaxy S7 device (SM-G930V) when project packaged with Vulkan support.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where streaming in or out levels each with their own stationary directional lights could cause the lighting system to lose track of which lights are loaded and surfaces be lit incorrectly

* Bug Fix: Fixed upside down triangle rendering with UCanvas::K2_DrawMaterialTriangle on OpenGL ES devices.

#### Optimizations

* New: Removed render thread stalls and improved reactivity when streaming mips for 2D textures.

* New project settings to globally disable/enable creation of depth-only and reversed index buffers.

* Added: Async loading bytecode from shader library. Along with bytecode de-duplication shader library will now pre-load requested bytecode to ensure there are no disk access related hitches in game when creating shaders.

* Cloth vertex buffers no longer generate dummy vertices, which reduces runtime memory usage of skeletal meshes with multiple sections of which only one has cloth.

* Fixed lights calling InvalidateLightingCache on Destroy in game, causing a hitch

* Fixed UWorld::DestroyActor in PIE calling InvalidateLightingCacheDetailed which can do a FlushRenderingCommands and cause a large hitch

* Snap volumetric fog light function target resolution to a factor of 32 to avoid constant texture reallocation

* Added SendAllEndOfFrameUpdates draw event to wrap skin cache events

* When compiling shaders for Metal explicitly emit the early-fragment-test qualifier unless the fragment shader invokes discard() or explicitly writes a depth-output semantic, this should better match driver behavior on Direct3D.

* Optimise the constant-propagation pass in hlslcc by using a hash-table to reduce the cost of looking up the existing constant assignment instructions.

* Vulkan will not use staging memory for dynamic vertex/index buffers on devices with unified memory access

* Implement support for the SV_DepthLessEqual semantic in Metal.

* Optimizations to reduce MetalRHI CPU overheads:

    * Avoid reallocating memory by making the TArray of uniform buffers a static C-array instead.

    * Use count-trailing-zero's intrinsics to eliminate redundant iterations over the set of bound resources.

* Small optimizations to MetalRHI primarily for iOS: - Only buffers less than a platform-specific threshold are uploaded via Metal's set*Bytes API to balance CPU overheads (on iOS this is 512 bytes, on Mac it is 4096 bytes). - Increase the minimum pool sizes for MTLBuffer's to reflect this. - Avoid redundantly rebinding uniform buffers in MetalRHI.

* Rewrite of the Vulkan pipeline cache: Multiple files can now be read off projectdir/Build/ShaderCaches/Platform folders; cache files are now compressed with rates of up to 70-90% off the original size.

* Bug Fix: Fixes for profilegpu on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Discard now gets called on BulkData on D3D11, D3D12 and Vulkan.

#### Postprocessing

* Improve performance of bokeh depth of field.

### Tools

* New: Improved XGE shader compiler. - Added support for XGE interception interface, which allows asynchronous streaming of shader tasks into XGE, and eliminates the stalling/flushing found in the old system. The old system has been renamed "Xml interface". - Both systems are available and selectable based on r.XGEShaderCompile.Mode CVar. Overview of the new system: - New system uses an additional XGEControlWorker process to manage communication between the engine and XGE. This is simply a copy of ShaderCompileWorker.exe (the implementation is part of SCW, but XGE requires the two files to be separate, hence the duplicate). - When shader jobs arrive from the engine, the shader compiler thread spawns an instance of XGEControlWorker within an XGE context, and connects to it via named pipes. - Job command lines are fed to the control worker via the pipe, which the worker enqueues within XGE by issuing a CreateProcess call, which is intercepted. Job completion is reported back to the engine via the named pipes. - New system is preferred over the old one, and is enabled with "-xgeshadercompile" command line switch or "r.XGEShaderCompile" cvar. - The new system depends on the "XGEController" engine module. Support for which is based on the WITH_XGE_CONTROLLER #define, or -xgecontroller/-noxgecontroller command line options.

* Added an option in the Texture browser to allow a texture to override the default compression quality. This has an effect for textures compressed as PVRTC or ASTC.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a condition where cooking DLC would cook all maps even if specific maps were specified.

#### AutomationTool

* Added support for pre-build and post-build steps when using MegaXGE.

* Added validation against shipping files in restricted folders. * Added a new SystemNonUFS type for staged files, which excludes files from being remapped or renamed by the platform layer. * Replaced the DeplyomentContext.StageFiles() function with simpler overloads for particular use cases (options for remapping are replaced with the SystemNonUFS file type) * Config entries in the [Staging] category in DefaultGame.ini file allow remapping one directory to another, so restricted content can be made public in packaged builds (Example syntax: +RemapDirectory=(From="Foo/NoRedist", To="Foo")) * An error is output if any restricted folder names other than the output platform are in the staged output.

* The -submit or -nosubmit arguments are only passed to child instances of UAT if they were specified on the original command line. BuildCookRun uses this flag to determine whether to submit, rather than just whether to allow submitting, so we shouldn't pass an inferred value.

* Added a -SkipHeader parameter to the UpdateLocalVersion command, to allow updating version files without updating Version.h and improve link times on incremental builds.

* During staging, we now create a manifest for each PAK file containing all the plugin descriptors in one place. Eliminates need to recurse through directories and read separate multiple files in serial at startup, and allows reading all plugin descriptors with one read. The "Mods" directory is excluded from the manifest, since these are intended to be installed separately by the user.

* Removed the -ForceLocal command line option. Settings are now always determined automatically if not set via environment variables, independently of the -BuildMachine argument.

* Simplified logic for detecting Perforce settings, using environment variables if they are set, otherwise falling back to detecting them. Removes special cases for build machines, and makes it simpler to set up UAT commands on builders outside Epic.

* Packaging a plugin will now force include what you use to be enabled. Since plugins distributed on the marketplace will be moved into the engine folder, they need to be IWYU compatible.

* Bug Fix: Fixed incorrect username in BuildGraph <Submit> task. Should use the username from the Perforce environment, not assume the logged in user name is the same.

* Bug Fix: Formatting in JSON output from C# tools now matches formatting used by the engine.

* Bug Fix: When patching temporary files are now put in the correct directories. Thanks David Yerkess @ Milestone

* Bug Fix: Fixed executable not being recompiled for a content-only project if a plugin which is enabled by default is disabled.

#### BuildGraph

* Added an example script to package ShooterGame for any platforms.

* Improved tracing for error messages. All errors are now propagated as exceptions, and are tagged with additional context information about the task currently being run. For example, throwing new AutomationException("Unable to write foo.txt") from SetVersionTask.Execute is now displayed in the log as: ERROR: Unable to write to foo.txt while executing <SetVersion Change="0" CompatibleChange="0" Branch="Unknown" Promoted="True" /> at Engine\Build\InstalledEngineBuild.xml(91) (see D:\P4 UE4\Engine\Programs\AutomationTool\Saved\Logs\UAT_Log.txt for full exception trace)

* Added support for nullable parameter types.

#### UnrealBuildTool

* Added support for adaptive non-unity builds when working from a Git repository. The ISourceFileWorkingSet interface is now used to query files belonging to the working set, and has separate implementations for Perforce (PerforceSourceFileWorkingSet) and Git (GitSourceFileWorkingSet). The Git implementation is used if a .git directory is found in the directory containing the Engine folder, the directory containing the project file, or the parent directory of the project file, and spawns a "git status" process in the background to determine which files are untracked or staged. Several new settings are supported in BuildConfiguration.xml to allow modifying default behavior:

		<SourceFileWorkingSet> <Provider>Default</Provider> <!-- May be None, Default, Git or Perforce -->
			<RepositoryPath></RepositoryPath> <!-- Specifies the path to the repository, relative to the directory containing the Engine folder. If not set, tries to find a .git directory in the locations listed above. -->
			<GitPath>git</GitPath> <!-- Specifies the path to the Git executable. Defaults to "git", which assumes that it will be on the PATH -->
		</SourceFileWorkingSet>

* Simplified how targets are cleaned. Delete all intermediate folders for a platform/configuration, and delete any build products matching the UE4 naming convention for that target, rather than relying on the current build configuration or list of previous build products. This will ensure that build products which are no longer being generated will also be cleaned.

* A <ExeName>.version file is now created for every target built by UBT in the same JSON format as Engine/Build/Build.version. This allows monolithic targets to read a version number at runtime, unlike when it's embedded in a .modules file, and allows creating versioned client executables that will work with versioned servers when syncing through UnrealGameSync.

* Use P/Invoke to determine number of physical processors on Windows rather than using WMI. Starting up WMIC adds 2.5 seconds to build times, and is not compatible with .NET core.

* Added support for declaring custom pre-build steps and post-build steps from .target.cs files. Similarly to the custom build steps configurable from .uproject and .uplugin files, these specify commands which will be executed by the host platform's shell before or after a build. The following variables are expanded within the list of commands before execution: $(EngineDir), $(ProjectDir), $(TargetName), $(TargetPlatform), $(TargetConfiguration), $(TargetType), $(ProjectFile). Example usage: public class UnrealPakTarget : TargetRules { public UnrealPakTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target) { Type = TargetType.Program; LinkType = TargetLinkType.Monolithic; LaunchModuleName = "UnrealPak"; if(HostPlatform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Win64) { PreBuildSteps.Add("echo Before building:"); PreBuildSteps.Add("echo This is $(TargetName) $(TargetConfiguration) $(TargetPlatform)"); PostBuildSteps.Add("echo After building!"); PostBuildSteps.Add("echo This is $(TargetName) $(TargetConfiguration) $(TargetPlatform)"); } } }

* The user's preferred source code IDE selected in the editor is now used to generate project files.

* Bug Fix: UnrealHeaderTool will now be re-run if the .build.cs file for a module has changed.

* Bug Fix: Fixed incorrect MSBuild version occasionally being used when invoking UnrealBuildTool.

* Bug Fix: Removed the dependency on the ShaderCompileWorker project when running with generating project files with the -useprecompiled argument.

* Bug Fix: Fixed hot reload generating import libraries without DLLs. Now that they are produced by separate actions by default, it was removing DLLs from the action graph due to the bSkipLinkingWhenNothingToCompile setting.

* Bug Fix: Fixed UBT stack size not being propagated through to the toolchain from the target settings.

* Bug Fix: Files in output directories which match build products in other output directories are now deleted. Prevents slate binaries from being loaded when a module is moved.

* Bug Fix: Fixed unchanged modules always being relinked with VS2017 15.3

#### UnrealGameSync

* Added variables for stream and client name, and the ability to escape any variables for URIs using the syntax $(VariableName:URI).

* Allow adding custom actions to the context menu for right clicking on a changelist. Actions are specified in the project's UnrealEngine.ini file, with the following syntax: +ContextMenu=(Label="This is the menu item", Execute="foo.exe", Arguments="bar") The standard set of variables for custom tools is expanded in each parameter (eg. $(ProjectDir), $(EditorConfig), etc...), plus the $(Change) variable.

* Always sync the Enterprise folder if the selected .uproject file has the "Enterprise" flag set.

* If working in a virtual stream, use the name of the first non-virtual ancestor for writing version files.

* Added additional search paths for UGS config files, and fix a few cosmetic issues (inability to display ampersands in tools menu, showing changelist -1 when running a tool without syncing). Config files are now read from: Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/UnrealGameSync.ini Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/NotForLicensees/UnrealGameSync.ini If a project is selected: <ProjectDir>/Build/UnrealGameSync.ini <ProjectDir>/Build/NotForLicensees/UnrealGameSync.ini If the .uprojectdirs file is selected: Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/DefaultProject.ini Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/NotForLicensees/DefaultProject.ini

* Project files are no longer generated when syncing precompiled binaries.

* The user's server settings are now read by spawning P4.EXE from the directory containing the project being opened, so people can override the P4PORT setting on a per-workspace basis using a P4CONFIG file.

* Added support for custom post-sync actions. These cannot be configured per-user, but are set by the project configuration file. Since they are always executed, they should be fast and reliable. Example additions to an UnrealGameSync.ini file: [Sync] +Step=(FileName="cmd.exe", Arguments="/C echo Change=$(Change), CodeChange=$(CodeChange), BranchDir=$(BranchDir)")

* Added support for predefined categories of files to exclude from being synced. The "Sync Filter" dialog now shows a list of these categories as well as the custom view that was previously supported. Several built-in categories are defined, for various target platforms, documentation, and so on. Each category is identified by a GUID, and projects may add or modify existing categories through the <ProjectDir>/Build/UnrealGameSync.ini config file. Config file entries are formatted as follows: +SyncCategory=(UniqueId="{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}", Name="Name of this Category", Enable=true/false, Clear=true/false, Paths="/Path1/...;/Path2/...") All fields other than the UniqueId are optional. Specify Enable=false to prevent the filter from being applied or shown to the user. Specify Clear=true when modifying an existing category to clear the existing paths rather than append new paths. Specify the list of patterns to be filtered out separated by semicolons.

* Bug Fix: Changed to use the default Perforce server port when opening P4V if there is not one set in the environment.

* Bug Fix: Fix tab names setting not being correctly read back in from config file.

* Bug Fix: Fixed build configuration not correctly being updated to reflect changes on other tabs.

* Bug Fix: Fix directory separators not being normalized before filtering files for sync. If the workspace root directory has non-native separators (eg. D:/P4), they will be propagated to the file list.

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when switching streams to a stream that does not contain the current project file.

* Bug Fix: Reparse points (symlinks) are no longer enumerated when recursively deleting directories. This could cause the contents of the linked directory to be deleted rather than the symlink itself, and can cause crashes if the symlink is to an outer directory.

#### UnrealVS

* Bug Fix: Fixed setting the command line to empty not affecting the underlying property sheet.

* Bug Fix: Fix single-file compilation for foreign projects, where the command line contains $(SolutionDir) and $(ProjectName) variables.

### UI

* Disabled the skeletal mesh's "Use async scene" property if the current project is not set to use an async scene, as this property will have no effect otherwise. A warning is shown on the property if the project does not currently use an async scene.
 A similar warning will be shown in the physics asset editor in the near future.

* Disabled viewport post processing when in cloth painting mode on clothing assets, to make the paint colours more easily distinguishable.

* Bug Fix: Stopped property context menus closing the whole window stack when an item is clicked

* Bug Fix: Improve PhAT UI to stop showing convex bodies as editable, as they currently contain no editable properties.

* Bug Fix: Fixed "Use Internal" button for Soundwave curves being too large.

* Bug Fix: Fixed various dropdown menus in the cloth asset creation popup not hiding themselves when the input focus is lost.

* Bug Fix: Fix for custom rows having their "is enabled" attribute stomped.

* Bug Fix: Force low quality mode for background blurs by default on android

* Bug Fix: Force low quality fallback mode on ES2 devices for slate blur widgets. This feature does not work on es2

* Bug Fix: Prevent resizing when a context menu is open. This prevents a number of rare crashes when a window is resized when a child menu is open.

* Bug Fix: Converted remaining uses of EKeyboardFocusCause to EFocusCause and properly deprecated it

* Bug Fix: Fix issues with marking a widget Blueprint class as abstract

* Bug Fix: Added a console variable to prevent touch events from sending multiple bogus mouse events. Disabled by default. Enabling this will prevent pen tablets from working but may be necessary for touch events to work in windows 7.

#### Slate

* Added search to editable texts

    * This can be invoked by selecting some text and using Ctrl+(Shift+)F3 to begin a search, and then using (Shift+)F3 to move through the matches.

    * It can also be done in code by calling BeginSearch and AdvanceSearch on an editable text.

* Added bApplyWidgetStyleToMenu to SMenuAnchor - if false, the popup is given a default FWidgetStyle when painted. This allows the menu to ignore the inherited tint and opacity, so a faded button can still summon a fully opaque menu.

* Bug Fix: Added a lock around access to slate active timers to protect it against race conditions when accessed on the slate movie thread and the game thread

* Bug Fix: Fixed issue where undocked tabs had no way to be made visible again after being hidden

#### UMG

* Bug Fix: UMG: Apply latent actions like in movie scene sequence player.

* Bug Fix: Scroll Widget Into View will now work for widgets not directly parented to a scroll box.

* Reduce memory footprint of somd UMG/Slate classes including UWidget, UBorder, UUserWidget, SWidget, and SButton

### XR

* Debug stereo layer support. This adds an option to render the debug canvas to a stereo layer which greatly improves console and stat readability in an hmd.

* Updated OpenVR SDK to 1.0.10.

* Bug Fix: Editor primitives we not being handled correctly with ISR.

* Bug Fix: Adding ISR and multiview support for custom depth. This fixes z-fighting that can occur between the custom depth pass and pre/base pass when the custom depth pass doesn't use ISR/multiview.

* Bug Fix: PR #3997: Fix quad buffer stereo crash in Windows (Contributed by ayamashev)

#### VR

* Added support for non-parallel projections for HMDs that have canted display panels

* Split interface for handling custom render targets from IStereoRendering into its own interface and unified common code between different VR platforms into a single base implementation class.

* Adding core VR controller re-centering delegate notification. Users can now use this delegate via the VRNotificationsComponent

* Adding in support for the SteamVR Knuckles controllers

* Code applying late updates has been unified across different VR platforms, reducing code duplication and unifying behavior.

* Added in SteamVR visible area mesh support. Can be toggled with vr.SteamVR.UseVisibleAreaMesh

* Updating SteamVR libraries to 1.10

* Oculus changes for SI1.16 and SI1.17 Adds Vulkan and D3D12 improvements/fixes for VR, depth target allocation for VR plugins, Android thread naming and a number of new Oculus features.

* Added Vulcan Extensions for OculusVR

* UE-47210 VR Mode in-Editor Viewport Camera is misaligned with HMD camera -Added calculation of the point on the render target directly in front of your eyes based on the HMD's projection matrix. -This is used by cropping spectator screen modes to adjust the cropping used to favor putting the eye center point in the center of the spectator screen. Oculus is most noticable as its center point is about .45 out of 1 from the top, rather than 0.5. -I also found that we were not successfuly detecting the aspect ratio of the spectator screen in windowed mode. We were using the render target aspect ratio, which is constant. Now we pass down the window size to get the correct aspect ratio.

* Updated library revision for GoogleVR

* Bug Fix: Fixed SpectatorScreen Flickering Fixed Spectator screen: need frame delay before assigning dynamically created rendertarget to spectator texture Fixed Spectator Screen: crash if you release a render target which is assigned as the spectator texture -Now I pull the Texture2DRHI out of the UTexture every frame and pass it to the render thread via a rendercommand. This has us getting it after it is created, and using it until the end of the current renderframe. -Note: scene capture components crash if you release their render target, so point them away from it first. -Note: this still leaves the possibility of setting a texture who's resources do not yet exist, or which have not been rendered to yet as the spectator screen texture. The spectator screen will, by default display all black if it doesn't find a resource at all. For debugging one can switch that to all white or breakpoint it in GetFallbackRHITexture().

* Bug Fix: Don't snap motion controllers to the origin when tracking is lost.

* Bug Fix: Vive spectator flat rect expanded to match other platforms.

* Bug Fix: PSVR Social Screen needs to go to 'mirroring' for hmd setup dialog because system dialogs are not visible in separate mode.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a regression causing splash screens on Oculus to be forced to a 16:9 aspect ratio regardless of the texture size used.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue with backwards compatibility, where the old XR module names (OculusRift, GearVR, etc.) still work with the command line and XR prioritization.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug that would modify the camera view unwantedly outside of VR, when the camera's LockToHMD option was enabled.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a crash that could occur when using a SteamVRChaperoneComponent on a XR platform other than SteamVR.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the in-game camera view could become vertically locked after playing in VR preview.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug with the Daydream controller model where the laser was rendering undersized.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug with SteamVR on Mac where controller haptics would not fire.

* Bug Fix: Fix for Daydream 2D transition on Android Fix for Cardboard on Samsung S8 devices when not set to native resolution

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug on Oculus, where the tracking space's origin was being ignored/reset on initialization.

## UPGRADE NOTES

### AI

#### Navigation

* Bug Fix: Fixed: bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled was not always working when re-opening map in the Editor
Fixed: Navigation Build was not always clearing nav-mesh tiles when bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled is enabled
Fixed: Streaming out a sub-level in the Editor was not always updating nav-mesh debug drawing

### Animation

#### Animation Blueprint

* USkeletalMeshComponet.bDisableAnimCurves is deprecated and converted to USkeletalMeshComponet.bAllowAnimCurveEvaluation. Note the meaning is reversed.

### Automation

* Moved functional testing automation commands to an exported helper.

### Blueprints

* Blueprint references to "Random Unit Vector in Cone" or "Random Unit Vector in Cone With Yaw and Pitch" will automatically be redirected, but function calls in code will not. See the Programmer Notes for technical instructions.

* *If your project's .uproject file contains an "AdditionalPluginDirectories" section with an entry listed as "Intermediate/Plugins", please remove that entry. If it is the only entry, it is safe to remove the entire section.*

    * In 4.17 we automatically added this entry to the .uproject file (only if it was writable) when you changed the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" option to something besides "Disabled" in Project settings->Packaging in the Editor UI. In 4.18 we've since removed this feature, as we found that it was causing issues with switching between nativized and non-nativized build workflows. Note that if it's not removed, those issues may persist.

* Most paths in the UE4 editor UI that cook and/or build the game now look to the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" option in Project settings->Packaging in the Editor UI in order to determine if Blueprint nativization should be enabled.

    * This means that if you've set that option to something other than "Disabled" for your project, any time you (or someone else working on the same project who you share the config files with) does something that cooks and/or builds the game, it will now do so with Blueprint nativization enabled.

    * This only applies to workflows that use "Cook by the book" mode. Blueprint nativization is not enabled with "Cook on the fly" mode, regardless of the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" setting.

    * One exception is the "Launch on <Device>" command. This command performs a "Cook by the Book" within the Editor process itself, and Blueprint nativization also cannot be enabled for cooking in that mode either.

    * Other situations that will currently always disable Blueprint nativization include when Cook on the Fly mode is used for launching a profile in the Project Launcher, and when a Blueprint-only project is launched through the Project Launcher using a binary (i.e. not built locally) version of the editor.

    * In the Project Launcher, you can create a custom Launch profile to override the current setting by adding the following into the "Additional Cook Options" field for the "Cook by the Book" settings: "-ini:Game:[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]:BlueprintNativizationMethod=<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>", replacing the "<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>" substring with one of those 3 available options.

* Bug Fix: Fix create object nodes failing to remove orphaned pins when connections to the orphaned pin are removed.

### Core

* FTimespan: The %D string formatter (previously total number of days) is now the zero-padded days component of the time span. Time spans are now always exported and stringified with a leading plus or minus sign.

* Modifying a TMap, TSet or TSparseArray while you are iterating over it with a ranged-for loop will now cause an assertion, matching the same behavior as TArray. If you need this functionality, you should change your loop to a traditional iterator loop:

		for (auto MyMapIter = MyMap.CreateIterator(); MyMapIter; ++MyMapIter)
		{
			if (RemoveElement(*MyMapIter))
			{
				MyMapIter.RemoveCurrent();
			}
		}

* Multiple MAX values will no longer be generated for UENUMs. Assets (including Blueprints) which refer to redundant MAX values will throw a warning about the missing value. These assets should be reexported to be saved with the new MAX value.

* Any custom C# projects (UAT plugins for example) should add a reference to the DotNETCommon assembly

* MoveTemp will no longer compile if passed an rvalue or a const lvalue. The code should either be fixed to not use const if possible, or the MoveTemp should be removed as it is redundant. Templates and macros can use MoveTempIfPossible when it's hard to tell if the argument is const - this follows the old behavior of MoveTemp.

* Bug Fix: Any references to FCoreUObjectDelegates::PreGarbageCollect/PostGarbageCollect delegates should be replaced with calls to FCoreUObjectDelegates::GetPreGarbageCollectDelegate() and FCoreUObjectDelegates::GetPostGarbageCollectDelegate() respectively

* Bug Fix: Fixed console output not working when using -log in a shipping build

### Gameplay Framework

* New: As part of the changes for cross-level actor references newly created Sequencer actor references are now SoftObjectPtrs, but older Sequences will have to be fixed up with "Rebind Possessable References" and resaved first.

* Scale can now be specified on play particle effect anim notify and spawn emitter Blueprint nodes.

* Remove advanced option CreateTemporaryCopiesOfLevels from the sequencer capture object, it has not worked properly in several versions.

* Bug Fix: UWorld functions PerformGarbageCollectionAndCleanupActors, DelayGarbageCollection, SetTimeUntilNextGarbageCollection, GetTimeBetweenGarbageCollectionPasses, and ForceGarbageCollection have been deprecated. The equivalent functions on GEngine should be used instead.

### Media Framework

* BREAKING: *MediaSoundWave* assets were replaced with *MediaSoundComponents*

    * There is no automatic conversion (components require different workflow & user decisions)

    * Attach new *MediaSoundComponents* to Actors or UMG widgets

    * Existing *MediaSoundWave* assets must be deleted from Content directory on disk

* BREAKING: *MediaPlayer* output settings were removed. Media assets now reference a *MediaPlayer* instead

* NEW: *MediaTexture* and *MediaSoundComponent* have a setting for the Media Player to pull data from

* NEW: *MediaAssets* module is now always loaded to prevent server-side BP problems

* NEW: Material texture samplers now require the new Sampler Type "External"

* NOTE: *MediaOverlay* assets were removed as a concept

    * We are currently reworking caption and subtitle support in UE4

### Online

* Any classes inheriting or making use of IOnlineTitleFile should be adjusted to take account of the new error string.

### Physics

* All UPrimitiveComponent and FBodyInstance deprecated functions will still work as they did before, but it's recommended that code using these functions is upgraded to call the newer ones. This should be as simple as following the instructions in the respective deprecation compiler warnings. Particular care should be taken when upgrading calls to FBodyInstance to ensure that the inputs are converted to the correct units expected by the new functions.

### Platforms

#### iOS

* Older project will need to open the editor and resave their IOS project settings .

### Rendering

* Projects requiring HDR support now need to set r.AllowHDR to 1 in their DefaultEngine.ini (or per-platform equivalents). Projects using HDR on consoles who want the feature to be off by default should modify DefaultGameUserSettings.ini to disable it.

#### Materials

* Bug Fix: Fixed behavior of custom material attribute display names and function names - The intention was to allow a display name and a separate name for use in the HLSL but one was being lost. Projects relying on the old behavior may need to update local shader modifications.

#### Mobile Rendering

* If your maps use Vertex Fog, Mobile preview and device will show on screen message: PROJECT HAS VERTEX FOG ON MOBILE DISABLED. Please open project settings and enable support for Vertex Fog in Mobile section.

* Bug Fix: Vulkan will pre-allocate less memory on mobile devices

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Shader cashing on Android. To enable shader caching use r.UseShaderCaching=1. Use r.SaveShaderCache command on device to save current cache to file, which then you can include into your game package.

#### Optimizations

* Vulkan pipeline caches will need to be regenerated via the r.Vulkan.SavePipelineCache console command. Previous cache files are no longer compatible.

## PROGRAMMING UPGRADE NOTES

### AI

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in GameplayTasks processing that could result in bloating of the UGameplayTasksComponent::KnownTasks array.

### Animation

#### General

* Bug Fix: FindUID no longer returns a pointer, any code calling it will need to be changed

### Audio

* New: To implement the source bus feature, we needed to split out volume attenuation vs distance attenuation. The bus audio needs to be mixed pre-distance-attenuation to avoid getting double-attenuated as the audio is output from the buses. This added some complexity with volume setting/getting in higher level code so if you were retrieving volume of playing sounds for a custom C++ feature, you may want to look at new volume getters and setters. To help with this, we made all volume setting and getting private to wave instances (FWaveInstance).

### Blueprints

* Functions that returned random unit vectors from within cones (whether this required a stream or not) have now been refactored into degree- and radian-based counterparts. The suffix "With yaw and pitch" has also been replaced with "Elliptical" for brevity.

	Where a *single* half-angle used to be required to specify the cone, the new **radian-based** function should be substituted; however, where *both* yaw and pitch were provided, the new **degree-based** function should be used instead. For example:

    * Calls to *RandomUnitVectorInConeFromStream()* should be replaced with **RandomUnitVectorInConeInRadiansFromStream()**.

    * Calls to *RandomUnitVectorInConeWithYawAndPitch()* should be replaced with **RandomUnitVectorInEllipticalConeInDegrees()**.

	From this point onward, the inconsistency in units between the elliptical and non-elliptical functions should be mitigated, as the degree or radian variants can now be used as appropriate.

* *If you have a custom build pipeline that relies on UAT BuildCookRun automation for cooking and/or building, note that in 4.18 it is no longer necessary to specify the -nativizeAssets flag to enable Blueprint nativization.*

    * Instead, UAT now looks at the value of the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" setting in DefaultGame.ini. This can be set by the user in the Editor UI in the Project Settings->Packaging section. If that value does not exist in DefaultGame.ini, then the value is assumed to be "Disabled" (off).

    * You can override the setting by including the following on the UAT command line: "-ini:Game:[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]:BlueprintNativizationMethod=<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>", replacing the "<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>" substring with one of those 3 available options.

    * Similarly, if your build pipeline calls UE4Editor.exe directly (for cooking) and/or UnrealBuildTool.exe directly (for building), the same holds true for those tools as well. You can also override the setting by including the same argument as noted above on each of their command lines, respectively. In that case, you'll need to ensure that both tools are specifying the same nativization method in their command lines.

### Editor

* New: To disable array reordering, use the metadata flag EditFixedOrder on the TArray.

* Developers can now register a delegate with SlateApplication to tell when a window's DPI changes

* The new port is set by default to 17777, which may conflict with projects that have hardcoded their ports when playing in editor.

#### Sequencer

* New: UTexture::GetMaterialType is now const

### Gameplay Framework

* New: As part of the cross-level actor references change, several types and headers were renamed:

    * FStringAssetReference is now FSoftObjectPath

    * FStringClassReference is now FSoftClassPath

    * TAssetPtr is now TSoftObjectPtr

    * TAssetSubclassOf is now TSoftClassPtr

    * StringAssetReference.h/StringClassReference.h is now SoftObjectPath.h

    * AssetPtr.h is now SoftObjectPtr.h

	Including the old headers will give compiler warnings. The old type names are not officially deprecated because many games will have a large number of them, but they should be fixed up as well.

* ComponentToWorld can no longer be directly accessed; use GetComponentTransform() instead.

### Networking

* Messaging: If you use the common helper classes, replace "Messaging" with "MessagingCommon" in your Build.cs files and remove the "Helpers/" subdirectory from your include statements (unless you actually include header files from "Messaging", in which case you need to keep "Messaging" and add "MessagingCommon").

### Online

* IOnlineIdentity::GetPlatformUserIdFromUniqueNetId is now const

#### Android

* This can be enabled via 'Android.EnableSustainedPerformanceMode' Cvar.

#### iOS

* ObjC exceptions default to off, if they are required then set bForceEnableObjCExceptions = true in your ModuleRules.

* To enable add the following line to your IOSRuntimeSettings config:
bDisableForceInline=true

### Rendering

#### Optimizations

* New:

    * *UTexture2D::RequestedMips* was removed and should be replaced by GetNumRequestedMips*()*

    * *UTexture2D::ResidentMips* was removed and should be replaced by *GetNumResidentMips()*

    * *UTexture2D::PendingMipChangeRequestStatus* was removed and streaming status should be handled through *HasPendingUpdate() and IsReadyForStreaming()*

### XR

#### VR

* If you maintain a custom VR plugin that needs to allocate its own render targets, you now need to move the methods out of your IStereoRendering implementation into a IStereoRenderTargetManager implementation. You can reduce the amount of duplicate code by extending FXRRenderTargetManager instead of implementing the interface directly.

* Bug Fix: A receipt based system was added to request an override of the social screen mode to mirroring so that system dialogs are visible on the social screen, or potentially for other reasons. HMDSetupDialog is the only current use of this system.

## DEPRECATIONS

### Core

* Removed unused member variable (FArchiveAsync2::bKeepRestOfFilePrecached)

* Removed FPackageFileSummary's CompressedChunks array as it was no longer being used by anything.

### Physics

* APEX Destuction has been moved to a plugin and is now disabled by default.  To enable the plugin, use the Plugin Manager (Edit > Plugins > Physics). 

### Platforms

#### Mac
* The support code for running the Unreal Engine 4 Editor & Games on Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan has been removed. The minimum macOS version required for Unreal Engine 4 is no MacOS 10.12.6 Sierra. This was necessary due to the number of Metal features absent from Mac OS X 1.11 that are now required for Unreal Engine 4.

### Rendering

* Deprecating support for the Editor running in Shader Model 4

    * This release we will be deprecating support for running the Editor while using Shader Model 4.  This mainly affects users with only DirectX 10 capable graphics cards.  Starting on the next release we will require a Shader Model 5 (DirectX 11/OpenGL4/Vulkan) capable card.

* Deprecating support for the games running in Shader Model 4 for Open GL

    * This release we will be deprecating support for running the game while using Shader Model 4 on OpenGL for both Windows and Linux.  Starting on the next release we will require a Shader Model 5 (OpenGL4) capable card.

#### Mobile Rendering

* The Android OpenGL ES deferred renderer has been removed.

### Tools

* CrashReporter has been removed from the public UnrealEngine distribution until it can be adapted to a more scalable solution that is usable by subscribers and licensees.

#### UnrealBuildTool

* Deprecated the BuildConfiguration and UEBuildConfiguration aliases from the ModuleRules class. These have been implemented as an alias ot the ReadOnlyTargetRules instance passed to the constructor for several engine versions.
