## 주요 기능

### 신규: 볼류메트릭 라이트맵

새로운 볼류메트릭 라이트맵은 미리계산 라이팅의 낮은 비용으로 무버블 오브젝트에 높은 퀄리티의 라이팅을 낼 수 있도록 해주는 기능입니다. 캐릭터, 파티클 시스템, 인스턴스드 폴리지, 기타 다이내믹 오브젝트가 환경 바닥에 붙어있는 느낌을 보다 잘 살릴 수 있게 되었습니다.

![image alt text](image_0.jpg)(w:500 convert:false)  ![image alt text](image_1.jpg)(w:500 convert:false)

볼류메트릭 라이트맵은 전체 라이트매스 임포턴스 볼륨을 4x4x4 라이팅 샘플 브릭으로 커버하여 공간 내 모든 지점에 미리계산 라이팅 정보를 저장합니다. 간접광 변화가 가장 심한 스태틱 지오메트리 근처에는 브릭 배치 밀도를 높입니다. 이 데이터 구조를 통해 GPU 상의 공간 내 어느 지점에 대해서도 효율적인 간접광 보간이 가능합니다. 볼류메트릭 라이트맵은 전체 컴포넌트에 대해 한 번이 아닌 각 픽셀에 대해 보간되어 기존 간접광 캐시 방식에 보다 신뢰성 높은 디테일을 낼 수 있으며, 결과적으로 빛샘 현상이 줄어듭니다.

볼류메트릭 라이트맵 사용법 관련 정보 및 자세한 내용은 [볼류메트릭 라이트맵](Engine/Rendering/LightingAndShadows/VolumetricLightmaps) 문서 를 참고하세요.

**볼류메트릭 포그에 미리계산 라이팅**

볼류메트릭 포그는 이제 볼류메트릭 라이트맵을 사용하여 공간 내 포그 위치에 미리계산 라이팅을 보간, 간접광 정보가 라이트맵에 있는 스테이셔너리 라이트가 포그에 영향을 주도록 할 수 있습니다. 스태틱 및 이미시브 라이트는 별다른 비용 없이 포그에 영향을 줄 수 있는데, 모두 볼류메트릭 라이트맵에 병합되어 있기 때문입니다.

![image alt text](image_2.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

이제 스카이라이트 그림자가 제대로 드리워져, 실내 영역의 포그가 과하게 짙어지지 않습니다.

[REGION:caption]
*1 - 포그에 스카이라이트 그림자 제대로, 2 - 포그의 균등 스카이라이트에 빛샘*
[/REGION]

**퍼포먼스**

* 삼인칭 캐릭터의 볼류메트릭 라이트맵 비용은 PlayStation 4 에서 GPU 시간 .02ms 입니다. 모든 간접광 캐시 렌더링 스레드 비용은 제거됩니다.

* 파라곤의 모놀리스 맵에서 메모리 사용량은 간접광 캐시일 때 5Mb 에서 DetailCellSize (디테일 셀 크기) 기본 설정의 볼류메트릭 라이트맵일 때 30Mb 로 올라갔습니다. 메모리 사용량은 stat memory 로 확인할 수 있습니다.

**상세 비교**


| 볼류메트릭 라이트맵 | 프리컴퓨티드 라이트 볼륨 / 간접광 캐시 |
| --- | --- |
| GPU 에서 효율적 보간 | CPU 에서 비효율적 보간 |
| 픽셀 단위 보간 | 오브젝트 단위 보간, 인스턴스드 컴포넌트에도 |

| 현재 레벨 스트리밍 미지원 | 레벨 스트리밍 지원 |

### 신규: 스태틱 스카이라이트 방향성 개선

스카이라이트는 라이트매스에 3차 구면 함수로 표현되었는데, 이는 일출이나 일몰의 디테일을 제대로 잡아내지 못했습니다. 이제 기본 해상도가 훨씬 높은 필터링 적용 큐브맵을 사용합니다. 라이트매스는 계단현상 제거를 위해 최종 수집(Final Gather) 광선 크기에 따라 큐브맵의 밉을 적절히 선택합니다. 밝기나 색 다변화가 큰 스카이라이트 큐브맵이 있는 차폐가 심한 씬에서 큰 차이를 확인할 수 있습니다.

*1 - 새로운 필터 적용 큐브맵 스태틱 스카이라이트, 2 - 원본 스태틱 스카이라이트*
[/REGION]

틈이 작을 수록, 스카이 라이팅의 방향성도 명확해집니다. 구멍이 충분히 작을 때 벌어지는 핀홀 카메라 효과를 재현해 내는 것도 가능합니다.

### 신규: 스카이라이트의 간접광 다중 반사

이제 월드 세팅 -> 라이트매스에 새로 생긴 Num Sky Lighting Bounces (스카이 라이팅 반수 횟수) 세팅으로 스태틱 / 스테이셔너리 스카이라이트의 간접광 다중 반사가 지원됩니다. 이 기능을 처음 구현해 주신 포럼 사용자 [Luoshuang](https://forums.unrealengine.com/development-discussion/rendering/112827-lightmass-multi-bounced-sky-lighting) 님께 감사드립니다.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_5.gif)(w:1000)
[/REGION]
[REGION:caption]
*1 - 스카이라이트 다중 반사, 2 - 스카이라이트 단일 반사*
[/REGION]

대부분의 경우 스카이라이트 다중 반사를 확인하기 위해서는 머티리얼에 디퓨즈 값이 높아야 합니다. 예를 들어, 디퓨즈 값 .18 (18% 회색)인 경우, 스카이라이트 반사 두 번째는 라이트가 방출하는 에너지의 .18^3 = .006 밖에 기여하지 못해 매우 미묘합니다. 디퓨즈 값이 .5 정도는 되어야, 스카이라이트 반사 두 번째 기여도가 라이트 방출 에너지의 .125 는 되어 눈에 보입니다.

보너스로 이미시브 메시에서도 다중 반사 효과가 나옵니다:

![image alt text](image_6.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

라이트매스는 라디오시티 솔버를 사용하여 스카이라이트나 이미시브 메시의 다중 반사를 계산합니다. 반사 한 번마다 분산이 가능하지 않은 빌드 시간이 늘어나므로, 조심해서 사용하시기 바랍니다.

### 신규: Apple ARKit iOS 11 지원

언리얼 엔진 4.18 에는 iOS11 에서 Apple 의 ARKit 가 바로 제품 출시가 가능한 수준으로 지원됩니다. iPhone 8 및 iPhone X 를 발표하는 키노트에서 Apple 과 협력해 온 덕분입니다. 

![image alt text](image_22.png)(w:1000 convert:false) 

![image alt text](image_23.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

기존 프레임워크 컴포넌트를 적극 활용하여 작업방식을 효율화시키고, 패스스루 카메라의 안정적 처리를 위한 기능을 추가하였으며, 퍼포먼스와 예측도를 향상시켜 재현 충실도를 높였습니다.

**주:** 언리얼 엔진 4.17 의 ARKit 실험단계 지원 이후 큰 변화가 있었습니다. 4.17 에서 만든 ARKit 프로젝트는 4.18 에서 새로 작업을 해야 할 것입니다. 4.18 변경사항 확인을 위해서는 [업데이트된 ARSample 프로젝트를 다운로드](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine/HostForForums/ARSample_418-2abf8bda292aec0b6c9b419084d9433b0c454317.zip) 하세요.

**시작하기**

이제 시작하기가 엄청 쉬워졌습니다. 이렇게만 하면 됩니다:

1. 프로젝트에 맞는 ARKit 플러그인을 켭니다.

2. 프로젝트 세팅의 bStartInAR 프로퍼티를 켭니다.

3. Pawn 에 CameraComponent 가 추가되었는지 확인합니다.

**알려진 ARKit 이슈**

* 아직 디바이스 회전이 완벽 지원되지 않습니다. 현재는 프로젝트에 지원하는 유일한 오리엔테이션으로 Landscape Right (가로 오른쪽)을 선택해야 합니다.

* 히트 테스트에 노출된 유일한 함수가 HitTestAtScreenPosition_TrackingSpace 뿐입니다. 반환하는 것은 CameraComponent 의 부모 스페이스 결과값입니다. 기본 구성에서라면 Pawn 스페이스입니다. 이것을 월드 스페이스로 전환하려면 현재 그 결과에  부모(, 즉 Pawn)의 월드 트랜스폼을 곱해줘야 합니다.

* HitTestAtScreenPosition_TrackingSpace 함수는 Types 파라미터를 무시하며, 항상 가능한 모든 표면에 대한 히트 테스트를 수행하고, 반환된 결과값은 FAppleARKitHitTestResult 구조체의 Types 칸 검사를 통해 수동 필터링이 가능합니다.

* FAppleARKitHitTestResult 는 Anchor 프로퍼티를 채우지 않으며, 항상 nullptr 입니다.

* 월드 스케일은 현재 기본값으로 간주하며, 변경할 수 없습니다.

### 신규: Google ARCore 개발자 프리뷰 지원

언리얼 엔진 4.18 에는 엔진의 일반 증강 현실 기능을 활용하는 Google ARCore 개발자 프리뷰에 대한 공식 지원이 포함되어 있으며, 향상된 패스스루 카메라 처리를 내세우고 있습니다.

ARSample 프로젝트가 ARCore 는 물론 ARKit 도 지원하도록 업데이트했습니다. [프로젝트를 다운로드하여](https://cdn2.unrealengine.com/Unreal+Engine/HostForForums/ARSample_418-2abf8bda292aec0b6c9b419084d9433b0c454317.zip) 4.18 변경사항을 확인하시고 바로 ARCore 개발을 시작해 보세요.

### Mac에서 SteamVR 지원

4.18 부로 UE4 는 SteamVR 을 통해 Mac에서의 VR 을 공식 지원합니다! PC 에서 사용하던 인터페이스 그대로 Mac에서도 사용할 수 있으므로, 프로젝트를 Mac으로 이식하여 돌리는 작업이 쉬워졌습니다. 이번 업데이트에는 Metal 2 지원과 다른 여러가지 런타임 최적화가 포함되어 있습니다. SteamVR 최신 버전으로 업데이트하여 직접 체험해 보세요!

### 신규: 클로딩 툴

스켈레탈 메시 에디터에서 클로딩을 만들고 설정할 수 있는 툴세트를 완전히 새로 개편했습니다.

툴이 실험단계 / 얼리 액세스 단계일 때 앞서 말씀드린 자잘한 버그 픽스와 개선사항 전부를 적용한 이후 추가된 작업입니다.

**주:** DCC 파이프라인을 선호하시는 분들을 위한 APEX 파일 임포트도 여전히 가능합니다.

### 신규: 미디어 프레임워크 개선

4.18 에서 미디어 프레임워크가 크게 확장 업데이트되어 앞으로 있을 실시간 비디오 합성, 시간 동기화, 작업방식 단순화, 캡처 하드웨어 & 비디오-오버-IP, 온라인 미디어 스트리밍, 언리얼 에디터와의 통합 등의 고급 사용방식 지원은 물론 안정성과 퍼포먼스가 향상되었습니다!

미디어 프레임워크 API 가 최적화되어 컴파일 시간 향상은 물론 C++11 의 최신 기능을 활용하도록 업데이트되었습니다. 추가로 일반적인 수준의 미디어 플레이어 로직을 푸시 기반 패러다임에서 풀 기반 방법론으로 리팩터링, 엔진과 무관한 재사용가능 클래스 속으로 이동시켜 미디어 플레이어 인터페이스에 대한 걱정을 덜 수 있게 되었습니다.

타임코드 기반 샘플 프로세싱 파이프라인으로 인해 반응속도와 퍼포먼스가 향상되었습니다. 이 파이프라인에는 오디오, 카메라 트래킹, 얼굴 트래킹 등 시간적으로 민감한 샘플에 대한 고빈도 틱 처리는 물론 어느 오브젝트에서도 프레임 활용도와 타이밍 예측도를 높여주는 다단계 틱 처리가 포함됩니다.

이제 오디오 재생이 새로운 오디오 믹서 API 에 통합되어 Synth 컴포넌트 기반으로 만들어진 (미디어 사운드 웨이브를 대체하는) 미디어 사운드 컴포넌트를 활용하므로 레벨 액터에 붙이거나 UMG 위젯에서 사용할 수 있습니다. 미디어 샘플 레이트 컨버터 덕에 (기존에는 16비트 44.1kHz 만 지원하던 것이) 이제 int8, int16, int32, float, double 입력 샘플은 물론 (가변 레이트 포함) 어떤 샘플 레이트도 지원하며, 오디오 입력 채널은 최대 8 개, 출력 채널은 1 및 2 개입니다 (서라운드 사운드는 4.19 에 계획되어 있습니다). 공간 오디오 역시 액터에서 미디어 사운드 컴포넌트를 통해 지원됩니다.

비디오 측면에서, 미디어 프레임워크는 이제 외부 텍스처 샘플러 API 를 사용하므로 메모리에 복사할 필요 없는 비디오 프레임 렌더링이 가능합니다. 이 기능은 현재 Android에만 구현되어 있으며, 다른 플랫폼으로 확장시킬 계획입니다. 문제 소지가 있는 트리플 버퍼 메커니즘을 샘플 큐로 대체하고, 이상한 비디오 및 픽셀 포맷, 오류가 있는 인코더도 더욱 잘 지원하게 되었습니다.

미디어 플레이어 에디터가 업데이트되어 트랙 포맷 선택기 메뉴, 오디오/비디오 캡처 디바이스 선택기, 캐시 상태 시각화 (지원하는 플레이어 플러그인용), 플레이리스트 제어, 플레이리스트 저장 기능이 추가되었습니다. 추가로, 문질러 이동하는 기능의 반응속도와 정보 오버레이가 개선되었습니다. 텍스트 오버레이 시각화 및 360 비디오 뷰포트 컨트롤이 실험단계로 지원되기도 합니다. 미디어 소스 애셋의 플랫폼별 미디어 플레이어 대체값 설정 역시 정상 작동합니다.

미디어 플레이어 트랙 및 트랙 포맷 쿼리, 오디오 / 비디오 / 웹캠 캡처 디바이스 열거, 미디어 플레이리스트에 파일과 URL 추가를 위한 블루프린트 함수 기능이 추가되었습니다.

언리얼 엔진 4.18 의 미디어 프레임워크에서 사용할 수 있는 엄청난 신기능 전부를 지원하도록 모든 미디어 플레이어 플러그인이 업데이트되었습니다.

**주:** 시퀀서 통합, 스테레오스코픽 & 360 비디오 지원, 하드웨어 가속 4K 재생 등 몇몇 기능은 아직 활발히 개발중입니다.

### 신규: 시퀀서 개선

시퀀서 작업 관련 삶의 질의 향상시켜줄 개선사항입니다:

* FBX 임포트 기능이 개선되었습니다. 스태틱/디폴트 트랜스폼 임포트, 맵에 해당 카메라가 존재하지 않는 경우 시네마틱 카메라 추가, 전방 X 축 강제 옵션 등이 추가되었습니다.

* 트랙, 키프레임, 경로 궤도 그리기 효율이 높아졌습니다. 이제 겹치는 키는 빨강 테두리로 그려집니다.

* 오디오, 스켈레탈 애니메이션, 샷 트랙 간략 편집 등의 편집 툴이 추가되었습니다.

### 신규: 피직스 애셋 에디터 개선

피직스 애셋 에디터(PhAT)가 크게 바뀌어 사용하기 편해지고 기능이 확장되었습니다! UI 모양과 느낌이 새로워져 업그레이드된 스켈레톤 트리 뷰를 통해 모든 씬 요소의 필터링과 표시가 향상되고, 노드를 사용하는 비주얼 방식으로 바디 사이 컨스트레인트를 구성하는 그래프 뷰가 새로 생겼습니다. 전에는 불가능했던 컨스트레인트 루프 구성까지도 할 수 있습니다.


![image alt text](image_7.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

UI 요소가 간결해졌습니다. 많은 부분이 논리적으로 맞는 위치에 이동 또는 변경되었습니다. 예를 들어 애니메이션 에디터에서처럼 표시 메뉴에서도 애니메이션 관련 세팅을 접근할 수 있습니다. 이제 애니메이션을 언제든 선택, 일시정지, 문질러 이동 가능합니다 (이전에는 시뮬레이션이 시작된 이후에만 가능했었습니다). 시뮬레이션 시작/중단 역시 애니메이션 도중 언제든 가능한데, 레벨 에디터와 비슷하게 명확히 단 하나 보이는 "시뮬레이트" 버튼 아래 옵션이 달린 식입니다.

그 외 업데이트 및 개선사항입니다:

* 시간 딜레이가 애니메이션 및 피직스 같이 작동하며, 애니메이션 에디터에서처럼 뷰포트 메뉴에서 빠르게 설정됩니다.

* 녹화 제어도 다른 애니메이션 에디터에서처럼 제어 메뉴로 제어됩니다.

* 피지컬 애니메이션 및 컨스트레인트 프로파일 UI 가 개선되었습니다. 컨스트레인트와 피직스 프로파일의 선택, 할당, 관리가 쉬워집니다.

* 컨스트레인트 & 바디 모드가 없어졌습니다. 이제 컨스트레인트와 바디를 같이 표시합니다. 각각에 대한 렌더링은 트리 뷰 & 뷰포트에서 켜고/끄거나 필터 적용 가능합니다.

* 새 바디 생성이 전에 있던 모달 대화창에서 새로운 ‘툴’ 탭으로 이동되었습니다. 새 애셋을 생성할 때마다 세 번의 클릭이 제거되어 반복처리 시간이 빨라집니다. 새 피직스 애셋을 생성할 때도, 전처럼 같은 위젯을 재사용합니다.

* 피직스 애셋을 콘텐츠 브라우저에서 바로 생성할 수 있게 되었습니다. 기존에는 스켈레탈 메시 애셋에 숨겨진 컨텍스트 메뉴 옵션을 통해서만 생성할 수 있었습니다.

* 바디/컨스트레인트에 수행할 수 있는 작업이 전부 컨텍스트 메뉴에 들어갔으며, 기존에 필요했던 키보드 단축키도 추가되었습니다.

### 신규: 피직스 애셋 바디에 대한 다중 컨벡스 생성

이제 본 별 다중 컨벡스 헐을 사용하여 피직스 바디를 자동 생성할 수 있습니다. 컨벡스 지오메트리가 아닌 것을 다중 컨벡스 헐을 사용하여 추정할 수 있습니다.

### 신규: 애니메이션 몽타주 타임 스트레치 커브

이 제 애니메이션 몽타주에 Time Stretch Curve (타임 스트레치 커브) 트랙을 추가하여 재생 속도를 제어할 수 있습니다! 몽타주에서 정상 재생 속도를 유지하면서 일정 부분만 선택적으로 느리게 만들 수 있습니다. 예를 들어 타임 스트레치 커브를 사용하면, 공격 애니메이션을 하나만 만들고도 재생 시간이 크게 다른 모양새 최적화 및 제어가 가능합니다.

타임 스트레치 커브를 사용하려면, 몽타주에서 MontageTimeStretchCurve 라는 이름의 플로트 커브를 만들고 키를 추가하여 커브를 정의합니다. 조금 더 세밀한 제어가 필요한 경우, 애셋 디테일 패널에서 타임 스트레치 커브 프로퍼티를 사용하여 커브 샘플링 방식을 결정하거나, 디버깅 목적으로 내부에서 생성된 마커 수를 조사할 수도 있습니다.


### 신규: RigidBody 애님 노드 개선

RigidBody 노드는 이제 루트 본 시뮬레이션 스페이스 옵션을 지원합니다. 붙은 스켈레탈 메시가 플레이어 캡슐에서 반대 방향으로 회전하는 경우를 처리할 때 좋습니다. 피직스 에디터에 관성 스케일과 우세 컨스트레인트 옵션을 노출시켜 안전성과 떨림 현상이 크게 개선되었습니다.

### 신규: 교차 레벨 액터 레퍼런스 개선

교차 레벨 액터 레퍼런스가 이제 약 오브젝트 레퍼런스를 지원하는데, 이는 기존에 애셋 ID/애셋 포인터라 불리던 것입니다. 액터를 가리키는 약 오브젝트 레퍼런스 프로퍼티를 생성하면, 이제 향상된 UI 를 통해 가리킨 대상이 언로드되거나 깨지는 것은 물론, 전체 액터 ID 도 같이 표시합니다:

![image alt text](image_14.png)(w:1000 convert:false)

이러한 교차 레벨 레퍼런스는 이제 "현재 레벨로 이동" 옵션을 사용하여 가리킨 액터의 이름을 변경하거나 이동시킨 경우 자동으로 수정됩니다. 해당 액터를 가리키는 다른 레벨/시퀀스가 있으면 자동으로 체크아웃하여 재저장 시도합니다. 이런 식으로 가리킨 액터를 삭제할 때 경고가 뜨기도 합니다. 스트리밍 레벨을 에디터에서 플레이할 때도 정상 작동합니다. 새로 생성된 시퀀서 액터 레퍼런스는 이제 약 오브젝트 레퍼런스이며, 이전 시퀀스는 먼저 Rebind Possessable References (빙의가능 레퍼런스 다시 묶기) 옵션을 사용한 뒤 다시 저장해야 합니다.

**주:** 이번 업데이트의 일부로 네이티브 유형 FStringAssetReference 와 TAssetPtr 의 이름이 FSoftObjectPath 와 TSoftObjectPtr 로 변경되었습니다.

### 신규: 에디터 내 현지화 프리뷰

### 신규: Windows, Mac, Linux에서 Visual Studio Code 지원

이제 모든 UE4 호스트 플랫폼에서 Visual Studio Code 를 사용하여 코드를 작성할 수 있습니다. 사용하려면 에디터 개인설정 대화창에서 선호 IDE 로 Visual Studio Code 를 선택하거나, 명령줄에 프로젝트 파일을 생성할 때 -vscode 인수를 붙여주면 됩니다. 모든 플랫폼에는 NET Core 2.0 런타임이 설치되어 있어야 하며, [Microsoft .NET Core website](https://www.microsoft.com/net/core) 에서 받을 수 있습니다.

Visual Studio Code 로 모든 프로젝트 유형 빌드 및 디버깅을 하기 위해서는, 몇 가지 추가 익스텐션이 필요합니다. 모든 플랫폼에서 Microsoft C/C++ 익스텐션과 C# 익스텐션이 설치되어 있는지 확인합니다. Linux와 Mac에서는 Mono Debug 익스텐션이 있어야 C# 프로젝트 디버깅이, LLDB Debugger 익스텐션이 있어야 C++ 프로젝트 디버깅이 가능합니다. 또한 C# 프로젝트 디버깅을 위해서는, mono 런타임이 설치되어 있어야 합니다:

### 신규: iOS Certificate 및 Signing 단순화

리모트 툴체인을 사용하여 원격 Mac에서 iOS 빌드하는 작업을 PC 에서 내릴 때, Certificate 와 Provisioning 셋업을 PC 의 프로젝트 세팅에서 가져옵니다. 더이상 원격 Mac에서 Keychain Access 를 사용하여 private key 나 certificate 를 설치할 필요가 없다는 뜻입니다.

### 신규: iOS 에서 테스크탑급 포워드 렌더러 (실험단계)

언리얼 엔진 4.18 에는 WWDC 2017 에서 있었던 Wingnut AR 데모에 사용된 데스크톱급 포워드 렌더러가 포함되어 있습니다! A9 이상 프로세서가 탑재된 iOS 10.3 이상 iOS 디바이스에서 지원되며, A10X 이상이 탑재된 iOS 11 이상을 강력 추천합니다.

![image alt text](image_16.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

이 렌더링 기술 덕에 최신 iOS 디바이스에 똑같은 물리 기반 셰이딩, 리플렉션, 라이팅, 섀도잉이 지원됩니다. 이 기능은 기존 모바일 렌더러보다 하드웨어 요구사양이 높고 실험단계이므로 디바이스 & OS 리비전에 따라 일부 기능이 정상 작동하지 않을 수 있습니다. 작동하지 않는 것으로 알려진 기능은 다음과 같습니다: GPU 스킨 캐시, GPU 모프 타깃, 애트머스페릭 포그, 멀티 샘플 안티 에일리어싱

### 신규: Android에 Gradle 기본 활성화

Gradle 은 이제 Android APK 패키징에 기본 옵션이 되었습니다. Ant 가 필요한 경우 Android 프로젝트 세팅에서 Enable Gradle 옵션을 끄는 것으로 여전히 가능하긴 하지만, Ant 는 폐기상태에 접어든 것으로 간주되므로 Gradle 로 전환할 것을 추천합니다.

**주:** 기존에 Enable Gradle 체크를 하여 Android SDK 라이선스 계약을 수락하지 않은 경우, Android 프로젝트 세팅에서 Accept SDK License (SDK 라이선스 수락) 버튼을 눌러줘야 합니다. 라이선스 수락 없이 패키징 또는 실행을 하려 하면 오류가 뜰 것입니다.

### 신규: Android 카메라 플러그인

언리얼 엔진에 이제 Android 디바이스의 전후방 카메라 접근을 노출시키는 옵션 플러그인이 생겼습니다. 이 플러그인을 켜면 새로운 Android 카메라 플러그인 프로젝트 세팅 패널이 추가되어 Android Manifest 요건을 선택할 수 있습니다.

### 신규: HTML5 최적화된 브라우저 WebAssembly 기본 활성화

WebAssembly 가 이제 HTML5 프로젝트에 기본으로 켜집니다. 주요 브라우저 제조사 다수가 WebAssembly 표준을 지원하면서, 애셋 크기와 브라우저 로드 시간, 웹에 퍼블리싱할 때의 런타임 퍼포먼스가 크게 향상된 것을 알 수 있습니다. 기존 최적화된 HTML5 출력 ASM.js 는 해체되어 코드 베이스에서 제거되었습니다.

**주:** 멀티 스레드는 아직 WebAssembly 에 사용할 수 없습니다. ASM.js 가 지원하기는 하지만, (현재로서) WebAssembly 는 싱글 그레드 모드에서만 실행됩니다. 하지만 멀티 스레드는 앞으로 있을 모든 브라우저 메이커에서 주력으로 밀고있는 기능이므로, 곧 구현될 것입니다.

### 신규: LLM 로우 레벨 메모리 트래커

새로운 LLM 로우 레벨 메모리 트래커는 **모든 메모리를 전부 단 한번에 트래킹 해내며**, 빠지는 것도 중복되는 것도 없습니다!

![image alt text](image_11.jpg)(w:1000 convert:false)

엔진 또는 게임에서 이루어지는 모든 할당은 어디에 속하는지를 나타내는 카테고리 태그 값이 할당됩니다. 모든 카테고리 총합이 게임에 사용된 메모리 총량에 더해집니다. 태그는 태그 범위 매크로를 사용하여 적용됩니다. 그 범위 안에서 이루어진 할당에는 지정된 태그가 붙습니다.

LLM 통계는 게임에서 stat LLM 또는 stat LLMFULL 로 볼 수 있습니다. 각 태그에 대한 현재 총합이 MB 로 표시됩니다. LLM 은 통계값을 csv 로 써 주기도 하여 값을 시간에 따른 그래프로 표시할 수도 있습니다.

LLM 은 그 속성상 각 플랫폼별로 추가해야 합니다. 현재 LLM 은 PS4 와 XboxOne 을 지원합니다. Windows는 실험단계 릴리즈로 지원합니다.

### 신규: XGE (Incredibuild) 셰이더 컴파일러 지원 개선

XGE (Incredibuild) 셰이더 컴파일러 지원을 개선하여, 이전 시스템에서 보이던 랙이나 멈춤 현상이 크게 줄어들었고, 새로운 셰이더 잡을 XGE 에 비동기 스트리밍할 수 있게 되었습니다.

새로운 시스템은 퍼포먼스 효율이 훨씬 높아져, Cook on the fly, Cook by the book, 에디터 내 셰이더 반복처리 작업을 포함한 모든 상황에서 셰이더 컴파일 속도가 크게 빨라집니다.

이 개선사항은 기본으로 켜지지만, Incredibuild 버전 8.01 이상이 필요합니다. 엔진 시동 시 버전 검사를 하여 지원되는 버전이 설치되지 않은 경우 구형 XGE 셰이더 컴파일러로 예비 전환합니다. 이전 시스템과 마찬가지로, XGE 셰이더 컴파일러 자체를 켜기 위해서는 명령줄 -xgeshadercompile 을 붙이거나 ConsoleVariables.ini 에 r.XGEShaderCompile 를 1 로 설정해야 합니다.

### 언리얼 오디오 엔진 (얼리 액세스 프리뷰)

신형 언리얼 오디오 엔진에 대한 개발이 지속되고 있습니다. 이번 릴리즈에는 보다 많은 플랫폼, 업데이트된 플러그인 아키텍처, 몇몇 흥미로운 신기능이 지원됩니다. 이와 같은 언리얼 오디오 신기능은 아직 얼리 액세스 단계입니다. 앞으로 있을 버전에서는 퍼포먼스와 안정성에 집중하겠습니다.

언리얼 오디오 엔진에 지원되는 플랫폼은 Windows, Mac, iOS, Android, XboxOne, PS4 에 더해, Nintendo Switch, Linux와 HTML5 도 지원됩니다. 신형 언리얼 오디오 엔진은 Linux에 기본 활성화됩니다. 4.17 과 4.16 에 처음 릴리즈된 다른 모든 백엔드에도 중요한 픽스와 개선사항이 적용되었습니다.

### 오디오 플러그인 아키텍처 개선 (신형 언리얼 오디오 엔진 전용)

오디오 플러그인은 오디오 엔진 코어 피처를 덮어쓰거나(override) 확장(extend)할 필요가 있는 오디오 이펙트에 쓰기 좋습니다. 오브젝트 기반 양쪽 귀 공간화, 소스 오클루전, 마스터 리버브와 같은 것은 코어 믹싱 엔진에 대한 훨씬 심도있는 통합을 통해서 가장 잘 이뤄낼 수 있습니다. 이러한 이펙트는 특수한 오디오 플러그인 지원이 필요합니다.

[REGION:asyncgif]

* 오디오 플러그인 아키텍처 개선을 통해 코어 믹싱 피처 오버라이드를 제작하고자 하는 써드 파티 개발자의 보다 부드러운 통합이 가능합니다.

* 플러그인 오버라이드 믹싱과 매칭을 위한 프로젝트 강화가 가능합니다: 소스 공간화, 소스 오클루전, 리버브

* 이제 에디터 재시작 없이 다른 플러그인으로 교체 가능합니다!

### 신규: 소스 버스 (신형 언리얼 오디오 엔진 전용)

소스 버스(Source Bus)는 신형 언리얼 오디오 엔진의 유연한 라우팅 기능을 선보이는 강력한 신기능으로, 다중 사운드 소스를 하나의 실시간 소스로 전송시켜 합칠 수 있습니다. 소스 버스는 사운드 베이스(Sound Base)에서 파생되었기에, 3D 믹스 버스로 공간화시키든 소스 이펙트 지속성 유지를 위한 수단이든, 사운드 웨이브 또는 사운드 큐와 같은 방식으로 재생 및 활용 가능합니다. 소스 버스는 오디오 디자이너를 위한 소중한 툴은 물론 앞으로 나올 흥미로운 기능을 위한 발판이 될 것입니다.

* 소스 버스는 어떤 오디오 소스든지 3D 오디오 소스로 라우팅 가능합니다. (자신을 포함해서, 런타임 오디오 피드백 시스템을 생성하여) 다른 소스 버스로 라우팅 가능합니다.

* 소스 버스는 새로운 USoundBase 유형으로, 보통의 사운드 BP, C++ API, 오디오 컴포넌트, 앰비언트 액터에서 다른 사운드인 것처럼 재생 가능합니다. 기간을 일회성 버스 아니면 0.0 으로 하여 무한 반복되는 루핑 소스로 지정할 수도 있습니다.

* 소스 이펙트(Source Effect)와 서브믹스 센드(Submix Send) 역시 보통 사운드 소스처럼 사운드 버스와 함께 사용할 수 있습니다.

* 다른 소스도 오디오를 버스에 보낼 때 서브믹스 센드와 비슷한 방식으로 보내며, 소스 버스로만 오디오를 보내도록 할 수도 있고, 서브믹스로도 전송하도록 할 수도 있습니다.

### 신규 서브믹스 이펙트 (신형 언리얼 오디오 엔진 전용)

Synthesis(신디시스) 플러그인을 단순한 딜레이에서 유연한 계산형 실효 리버브까지 아우르는 시간 기반형 Submix Effects(서브믹스 이펙트)로 업데이트하여, 복잡하고 흥미로운 상호작용형 공간 이펙트를 만들 수 있습니다:

* **Delay**: 딜레이 - 블루프린트에서 런타임에 변조할 수 있는 단순 멀티채널 딜레이 라인입니다. 이 이펙트가 적용되어 실행중인 지정 서브믹스에 전송된 오디오에서 단순 브로드캐스트 딜레이를 시뮬레이션하는 이펙트이며, 애니메이션이나 기타 게임플레이 시스템과 밀리초 이하 단위로 동기화시키는 데 사용할 수 있습니다.

* **Tap Delay:** 탭 딜레이 - 일정량의 탭(에코) 효과를 낼 수 있는 복합 멀티채널 딜레이 이펙트로, 런타임 도중 강력한 블루프린트 API 를 통해 독립적인 추가, 변경, 제거가 가능합니다. 각 탭은 탭 감쇠, 탭 방위각, 탭 딜레이가 파라미터로 되어 있습니다. 도플러 효과 시뮬레이션, 이른 반향 에뮬레이션, 기타 여러가지 딜레이 기반 믹스 이펙트에 쓰기 좋습니다.

* **Flexiverb:** 플렉시버브 - 계산 비용이 비싸지 않은 단일 채널 리버브 알고리즘으로, 최소한의 곱셈으로 최대한의 에코 밀도를 내는 데 최적화되어 있습니다. 이 이펙트는 CPU 리소스가 제한된 플랫폼에서 작은 방의 울림같은 효과를 에뮬레이션하는 데 최적입니다.

### 개선된 어테뉴에이션 세팅

어테뉴에이션(감쇠) 세팅들에 대해 명확성과 체계적인 정리를 위주로 하는 개선이 있었습니다. 여기에는 카테고리에 따른 어테뉴에이션 세팅 표시에서 특수한 편집 조건을 통해 현재 활용되는 어테뉴에이션 세팅을 명확히 해주는 기능이 포함됩니다.

### 신규: VR / AR 카메라 시스템 리팩터링

언리얼 엔진 4.18 에는 이제 카메라 컴포넌트와 원본 뷰 양쪽에 대한 기본 카메라 구현이 포함되어 있어, 최신 업데이트를 엔진에서 자동으로 처리해 줍니다. 이 기본 카메라 구현은 뷰 타깃에 카메라 컴포넌트가 있을 때 디바이스의 보정된 원점에서 현실의 디바이스 위치에 해당하는 만큼 (상대 트랜스폼을 통해) 위치를 이동시킵니다. 그 결과, API 구현을 위한 하드웨어 개발자 몫이 훨씬 작아져, 효율이 대폭 향상되었습니다.

**주:** 모든 기존 플랫폼에는 카메라 구현이 빠지고 기본 카메라 구현으로 대체되어 있습니다.

## RELEASE NOTES

### AI

* Added a Blueprint callable function AIPerceptionComponent.SetSenseEnabled that can be used to toggle specific AI senses.

* Bug Fix: Prevent crashes if UMockTask_Log is created manually rather than via the CreateTask factory method

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in AISense_Sight processing that resulted in inconsistent frequency of "line of sight lost" reporting. Now this even should be reported only once, when sight of target is lost.

#### Behavior Tree

* Bug Fix: Prevent an ensure in UBlackboardComponent::ClearValue when called on a component with a null BlackboardAsset

#### General

* Bug Fix: Fixed UAIPerceptionSystem::GetCurrent causing a BP error when its WorldContextObject parameter is null

#### Navigation

* Bug Fix: Fixed UCrowdFollowingComponent::UpdateCachedDirections crashing when CharacterMovement is null

* Bug Fix: Fixed: bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled was not always working when reopeinig the map Fixed: Navigation Build was not clearing some mesh tiles when bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled is enabled Fixed: Streaming out a level in editor was not always updating NavMesh debug draw

### Animation

* New: TimeStretchCurve system for AnimMontages. Allows adjusting playback time of montages in a non constant way. This optional curve allows the user to determine how animation frames are influenced by play back time scaling, instead of using a constant play rate scaling. For example, with an attack animation, the strike could have zero influence (no play rate), and the recovery time could have 100% influence (most play rated). This system is entirely optional and compatible with current Montage API. You still determine desired play back time via the Play Rate parameter. Based on desired playback time, if there is a curve named 'MontageTimeStretchCurve' then, it will use the curve to determine animation frames to play based on playback time and TimeStretchCurve. Otherwise, if no curve exists, it is done using the constant supplied PlayRate.

* Added FAnimationRuntime::LerpPosesPerBone

* Added FAnimationRuntime::LerpPoses. Blends two poses together, but first pose is also storing results. To save on copying poses when not necessary. Removed individual use of ZERO_ANIMWEIGHT_THRESH, instead use FAnimWeight functions. FAnimationRuntime weight functions use FAnimWeight for consistency. (IsFullWeight was different).

* Added outline to skeletal mesh section selection.

* Changed behaviour when reimporting an Alembic Cache to ensure at least one track is ticked

* Animation Optimization: Added EMeshComponentUpdateFlag::OnlyTickMontagesWhenNotRendered to only update montages when not rendered, instead of doing a whole pose update. This means on dedicated servers we'll only update montages when needed, and not the AnimGraph, which we have no need for. This is also affects non rendered meshes on clients.

* Added short dummy bones to end effectors to prevent their rotations from being too aggressively compressed.

* Fixed broken 'ComputeCompressionError' with additive animations. Optimized 'ComputeCompressionError' by caching bone indices, so they don't have to be looked up every frame. Added CompressCommandletVersion INDEX_NONE to bypass DDC and test locally recompression.

* RemoveLinearKey optimizations from licensee submission: https://udn.unrealengine.com/questions/167344/animation-compression-doesnt-scale-well.html

* More Anim Compression Fixes: - Fixed frame->error bug in FAnimationUtils::ComputeCompressionError resulting in incorrect compression error measurement, and in some rare animations not being able to find a suitable compressor. - Make sure automatic compression actually go through all the compressors. - Removed unused reduction based on retargeting settings.

* Automatic Compression fixes. - Error reporting: normalize rotations and added ensures to make sure NaNs do not sneak in there. - switched size reporting from 32 to 64 bits, so we have enough space for large recompression jobs. - fixed compression ratio to be accurate. Measures actual compressed animation data instead of whole asset size. - prevented infinite loop when trying to recompressed a failed automatic compression. - Fixed reporting when no suitable compressors were found. - Compression ratio is now against uncompressed raw size, and not (trivially) compressed raw size. - Force recompression if data we got back from DDC is invalid.

* Bug Fix: SkelMeshComponent LOD update only refreshes transforms when rendered. If AnimGraph eval is done, make sure Graph has been updated at least once.

* Bug Fix: SkeletalMeshComponent::InitAnim - Do not call RefreshBoneTransforms without calling TickAnim first. AnimGraph could get in a bad state. - Do not call RefreshBoneTransforms if AnimInstance has not been initialized. - Do not call RefreshBoneTransforms if bUseRefPoseOnInitAnim is set. Which it could if bForceReinit was false.

### Audio

* New: Spatialization, Reverb, and Occlusion plugin support has been significantly improved. It now supports per platform mix and match of plugins. Audio plugins can now also be swapped out without closing the editor.

* New:

    * Cleaning up Attenuation Settings UI.

    * Breaking up attenuation settings into categories.

    * Added edit condition so only editable if attenuation settings are overridden in audio components or sound cues.

    * Added ability to do a normalization for stereo spatialized sound sources (to avoid clipping when spread is

    * Added ability to apply a HPF to a sound source based on distance for audio mixer and added that option to attenuation settings if audio mixer is enabled.

* New:

    * Source buses allow any audio source to route their audio to a 3d audio sources.

    * Source buses can be routed to other source buses (including themselves).

    * Source buses are a new USoundBase type, so can be played as if it was another sound in our normal sound BP and C++ APIs, audio components, and ambient actors.

    * Buses can have their duration specified to become a 1-shot bus or, if specified as 0.0, will be treated as a looping source (i.e. indefinite duration).

    * Source effects and submix sends can be used with buses like normal sound sources.

    * Other sources send their audio to buses in an analogous way to submix sends and can opt to only send their audio to buses vs also sending their audio to submixes.

    * Fundamental architectural feature allows sources to be mixed into 3d buses which allow persistence of source effect state between instances of other sources and opens up the possibility for a number of other exciting features.

* New: The new Unreal Audio Engine now supports HTML5.

* New Submix Effect added: Tap Delay. The Tap Delay submix effect allows you to add any general number of taps ("echoes") and control them independently, both ahead of time and at runtime using Blueprint functions. This can be used to emulate the doppler effect, simulate early reflections, and more.

* Don't send or mix built-in reverb submix if there's a plugin reverb enabled.

* Added Blueprint functions to the Sound Utilities plugin: GetBeatTempo. GetFrequencyFromMIDIPitch, GetMIDIPitchFromFrequency, and GetPitchScaleFromMIDINote.

* Added a new submix effect to the Synthesis library: Flexiverb.
Flexiverb is a computationally inexpensive single-channel reverb algorithm optimized for maximizing echo density with as few multiplies as possible. This effect is best suited for emulating small room reverberation on platforms where CPU resources are limited.

* Fix for allowing audio plugins to work in non-editor builds who don't support multiple audio devices for PIE.

* The new Unreal Audio engine has been refactored so that audio buffers are allocated with platform specific memory alignments.

* Adding attack and decay interpolation times for focus feature to avoid fast sweeps of focus.

* Optimization in converting procedural audio buffers to 16 bit PCM.

* Bug Fix: Fix for incorrect spatialization of audio sources on iOS using legacy audio engine.

* Bug Fix: Implemented basic handling for audio device hotswap. This will solve the issue of the UE4 editor hanging when an audio device is unplugged from the system. However, please note that any audio sources played via source or Blueprint will be stopped when this happens.

* Bug Fix: Audio: Fix case where audio is already set to be a preview sound. Sequencer sets the sound to be a preview sound when scrubbing in editor.

* Bug Fix: Streaming audio on MacOS and iOS in the audio mixer is now fixed.

* Bug Fix: Fixed Platform Headroom levels for Android.

* Bug Fix: Fixing parameter interpolation in the audio mixer.

* Bug Fix: Fix Perforce automation routine to return files whose last action was a rename.

### Blueprints

* New: Find-in-Blueprints is now hosted in a global tab by default. This tab can remain open even if the Blueprint Editor window is closed.

* New: Added MakeMap Blueprint node.

* New: Added MakeSet Blueprint node

For consistency, this entire family of functions have been modified and renamed to provide versions that take arguments in both degrees and in radians. See the Programmer notes for specific details.

* Blueprint input nodes for key, action, and axis can now be subclassed from other modules.

* Made the compact node title for cross and dot product the words cross and dot rather than hard to see . and x symbols

* Improved the visual styling of user disabled nodes and development-only nodes (still an experimental feature, but this is a step towards removing that label)

* Allow drag-dropping component Blueprint assets into the graph to create Add Component nodes and improved the error message when dragging something that cannot be dropped into an actor Blueprint

* Added a tooltip field for each value in a user defined enum

* Added a key binding for Find References (Shift+Alt+F)

* Improved the implementation of Goto Definition, allowing any node to implement it by overriding CanJumpToDefinition or JumpToDefinition - Collapsed 'Goto Code Definition' for variables and functions into the same path, so there aren't separate menu items and commands - The default behavior for UK2Node subclasses is to call GetJumpTargetForDoubleClick and call into FKismetEditorUtilities::BringKismetToFocusAttentionOnObject - Going to a native function now goes thru a better code path that will actually put the source code editor on the function definition, rather than just opening the file containing the definition

* Added a key binding for Goto Definition (Alt+G)

* Allow 'Goto Definition' and 'Find References' to be used while stopped at a breakpoint

* Added an option to disable the comment bubble on comment boxes that appears when zoomed out

* Added the full name of the type, container type, and value type (for maps) to the tooltips for the type picker on Blueprint variables, so long names can be read in full

* Bug Fix: Fixed ensure when connecting the output pin of a create delegate node to a wildcard input.

* Bug Fix: Correctly reconnect split pins when changing class on create widget, construct object, and spawn actor nodes

* Bug Fix: Fix two compilation manager issues: Make sure CDOs are not renamed under a UClass, because they will be considered as possible subobjects, which has bad side effects and make sure that we update references even on empty functions, so that empty UFunctions are not left with references to REINST data

* Bug Fix: Prevent crashes when a loading blueprint that implement an interface that was deleted

* Bug Fix: Fixed Construct Object not working correctly with split expose on spawn pins.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an EDL assert on load in a nativized build caused by a native reference to a nativized BP class that also references a nativized UDS asset.

* Bug Fix: Prevent wildcard pins from being connected to exec pins

* Bug Fix: Made drag-dropping assets into a graph to create a component undoable

* Bug Fix: Made wires into/out of a user-disabled node draw very dimly (other than the passthrough execution wire if it exists)

* Bug Fix: Fixed the tooltip when dragging a variable onto an inherited category so it shows the 'move to category' hint

* Bug Fix: Changed UK2Node::GetPassThroughPin so that only the execution wire on nodes with exactly one input and one output exec wire will have a corresponding pass-through pin (when there is ambiguity in which exec would be used, e.g., with a branch or sequence or timeline node, the subsequent nodes are now effectively disabled as well)

* Bug Fix: Changed the behavior of various things that were hard-coded to operate on the first event graph to instead operate on the most recently used event graph page

* Bug Fix: Fixed the tooltip of a user defined structure not updating immediately in the content browser after being edited

* Bug Fix: Fixed discrepancy between the Structure tab name and the menu option for the tab in the user defined structure editor (now both say Structure Editor)

* Bug Fix: Adjust search query when doing 'Find References' on variables from My Blueprints so that bound event nodes show up for components and widgets

* Bug Fix: Allow the autowiring logic to better break and replace existing connections when made (e.g., when dragging a variable onto a compatible pin with an existing connection, break the old connection to allow the new connection to be made)

* Bug Fix: UField::Serialize no longer serializes its next ptr, UStruct::Serialize serializes all Children properties instead. This resolves a hard circular dependency between function libraries that EDL detected. It was resolved in an ad hoc way by the old linker

* Bug Fix: User-Defined Struct assets now support their own external dependencies when nativized.

* Bug Fix: Blueprints will no longer remain dirty when compiling when a Get Class Defaults node with a split struct pin is in the graph.

* Bug Fix: Changing the pin type of a function input from struct to something else now correctly works when the struct input pin had been split.

* Bug Fix: Undoing 'Collapse to Macro' now works as expected

* Bug Fix: Prevent CDOs from getting weird names if they are loaded while we are reinstancing

* Bug Fix: Clear out null entries in the LastEditedDocuments list during PostLoad() and remove entries when a graph is being deleted to prevent new nulls from being added

* Bug Fix: Subobjects in Sets and Maps are now properly patched into the linker table. Required add of missing implementation for sets/maps to FInstancedPropertyPath, correct uproperty logic in FFindInstancedReferenceSubobjectHelper::GetInstancedSubObjects_Inner

* Bug Fix: Added support for creating appropriate outers for objects that must be nested within another class during fuzzing (ones that specify Within=, other relationships aren't knowable yet)

* Bug Fix: We now prevent ConstructGenericObject nodes from compiling in a Blueprint if the selected class type does not include 'BlueprintType' in its inheritance hierarchy.

* Bug Fix: Fix for crash when attempting to access a value in an array by ref, when the array being accessed was trying to be found on a null object ref

* Bug Fix: Placing a get to an input parameter with same name as a member variable no longer creates an incorrect property reference.

* Bug Fix: Fix rare crash when running ConformImplementedEvents when loading .uassets asynchronously

* Bug Fix: Fixed a potential crash when changing the ChildActorComponent class default value on a Blueprint that also sets the class in the Construction Script.

### Core

* New: Support for Visual Studio Code

    * Pass "-vscode" to GenerateProjectFiles in order to create a set of task/launch/cppconfig files that can be used by Visual Studio Code to build and debug Unreal Engine projects

    * A new source code access plugin that will allow the opening of projects and source files in Visual Studio Code

* New: Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) upgraded to branch 3071 Win32/Win64/Mac. Added web browser support for foreign language character input via IME.

* Core: Various improvements to FTimespan

* Core: Added scalar division to FTimespan

* Core: Added TLruCache template for least-recently used caches

* Core: Added FTimespan::Ratio

* Changed the default sorting algorithm to intro sort. - Algo::Sort and ::Sort will call Algo::IntroSort - The sort version that was in Algo::Sort is now in Algo::LegacySort

* Added the ability to verify the DDC content is not stale. Systems have to opt in (-VerifyDDC).

* Fixed documentation comments for FName inequality operator.

* Fixed incorrect definition of DECLARE_DELEGATE_NineParams, DECLARE_MULTICAST_DELEGATE_NineParams macros.

* Added FString::ToUpper() and FString::ToLower() rvalue overloads for improved efficiency.

* Improved UnrealHeaderTool to support multiple interface definitions in a single header.

* Improved UnrealHeaderTool's error message when unsupported template parameters are provided in a TSet property.

* Improved Intellisense when generated headers are missing or out of date (eg. line numbers changed, etc...). These errors seem to be masked by VAX, but are present when using the default Visual Studio Intellisense. * UCLASS macro is defined to empty when __INTELLISENSE__ is defined. Previous macro was preventing any following class declaration being parsed correctly if generated code was out of date, causing squiggles over all class methods/variables. * Insert a semicolon after each expanded GENERATED_BODY macro, so that if it parses incorrectly, the compiler can still continue parsing the next declaration.

* Added container modification checks to ranged-for loops which are iterating over TMap, TSet and TSparseArray.

* Added code to verify compression flags in package file summary to avoid cases where corrupt packages are crashing the editor

* Added a batch file to Engine/Build/BatchFiles for detecting and running MSBuild

* Added VisitTupleElements, which calls the given functor with each element in the tuple.

* Improved UnrealHeaderTool's error message when multiple types with the same name are found.

* Changed the logic so that engine UObjects boot before anything else. The engine classes are known to be cycle-free, so we will get them done before moving onto game modules.

* UENUM enumerator initializers can now be arbitrary C++ constants, including values which are not parsed by UnrealHeaderTool (e.g. values from third party headers). However, script generator plugins will not have access to these values at script-generation time. Added support for editor-only data UENUMs. Fixed multiple MAX values being generated for UENUMs which already define a MAX.

* Logging improvements for pak signature check failures

* Split RunExternalExecutable into RunExternaNativelExecutable and RunExternalDotNETExecutable

* Added editor support for packages cooked with the Event Driven Loader enabled.

* Added validation that arguments passed to the checkf macro are valid sprintf types, and fix up a few places which are currently incorrect.

* When creating GC clusters and asserting due to objects still being pending load, the object name and cluster name will now be logged with the assert.

* Added FBase64::GetDecodedDataSize() to determine the size of bytes of a decoded base64 string

* PR #3847: Add GC callbacks for script integrations (Contributed by mhutch)

* Added support for displaying log timestamps in local time. Set LogTimes=Local in *Engine.ini, or pass -LocalLogTimes on the command line.

* Various changes to Unreal Build Tool and DotNETUtilities assemblies to help support building and executing on the .NET Core 2.0 platform

* Added ENABLE_GC_OBJECT_CHECKS macro to be able to quickly toggle UObject pointer checks in shipping builds when the garbage collector is running.

* Fixed a race condition with the async loading thread enabled caused by missing linker object.

* PR #3839: Make non-encoding specific Base64 functions accessible (Contributed by stfx)

* Moved some common C# classes into the DotNETCommon assembly

* FString::Trim() and FString::TrimTrailing() have been replaced with separate versions to mutate (TrimStartInline(), TrimEndInline()) or return by copy (TrimStart(), TrimEnd()).

* Allow the network version to be set via Build.version if it's not overriden from Version.h.

* UBT - Add a ToString to ProjectFile.Source file to help with debugger watch presentation

* Plugins may now specify a list of supported target platforms, which are propagated to any .uproject file that enables it. This has several advantages over the per-module platform whitelist/blacklist: * Platform-specific .uplugin files can now be excluded when staging other platforms. Previously, it was only possible to determine which platforms a plugin supports by reading the plugin descriptor itself. Now that information is copied into the .uproject file, so the runtime knows which plugins to ignore. * References to dependent plugins from platform-specific plugins can now be eliminated. * Plugins containing content can now be unambiguously disabled on a per-platform basis (having no modules for a platform does not confer that a plugin doesn't support that platform; now it is possible to specify supported platforms explicitly). * The editor can load any plugins without having to whitelist supported editor host platforms. UE4 targets which support loading plugins for target platforms can set TargetRules.bIncludePluginsForTargetPlatforms (true for the editor by default, false for any other target types). This defines the LOAD_PLUGINS_FOR_TARGET_PLATFORMS macro at runtime, which allows the plugin system to filter which plugins to look for at runtime. Any .uproject file will be updated at startup to contain the list of supported platforms for each referenced plugin if necessary.

* Fixed lazy object pointers not being updated for streaming sub-levels in PIE. Fixed lazy pointers returning object that is still being loaded which could lead to undefined behavior when client code started modifying the returned object.

* PR #3760: Fix typo (Contributed by jesseyeh)

* Made MoveTemp static assert when called on a const reference or rvalue, to allow inefficiencies to be tracked more easily. Added MoveTempIfPossible which follows the earlier behavior, which is still useful for templates and macros where it's unclear if the argument is valid.

* Removed the extraneous subfolder when writing out .mprof files.

* Fix non-thread safe construction of FPluginManager singleton. Length of time spent in the constructor resulted in multiple instances being constructed at startup, making the time to enumerate plugins on slow media significantly worse.

* Optimizations to SignedArchiveReader

* Improved assert message when the initial package read request was too small.

* Made max package summary size to be configurable with ini setting

* Add support for a "Mods" folder distinct from the project's "Plugins" folder, instead of using the bIsMod flag on the plugin descriptor. * Mods are enumerated similarly to regular plugins, but IPlugin::GetType() will return EPluginType::Mod. * The DLCName parameter to BuildCookRun and the cooker now correctly finds any plugin in the Plugins or Mods directory (or any subfolders).

* Added a new TArray constructor that takes a raw pointer and a count. Improved checks inside TArray::Append() to allow nullptr in empty ranges.

* UDataTable::AddReferencedObjects will no longer try to iterate over the RowMap if there's no UObject references in it.

* Custom Version Container will no longer be always constructed in FArchive constructor. This reduces the number of the Custom Version Container allocations considerably.

* Removed obsolete code for UHT makefiles.

* Moved FSimpleObjectReferenceCollectorArchive and FSimpleObjectReferenceCollectorArchive to be internal archives used only by FReferenceCollector so that they are constructed only once per GC task instead of potentially multiple times per GC (as was the case with UDataTables and BlueprintGeneratedClasses).

* Added new AllOf, AnyOf and NoneOf algorithms.

* Shrunk size of code generated by UnrealHeaderTool, around 10% of Win64 executable size.

* Deprecate /-prefixed commandline switches as they cannot be distinguished from absolute file paths on Linux/Mac.

* Bitfield properties can now be exposed on spawn.

* FName now works correctly with Lex::To/FromString.

* Added FQuat::InitFromString.

* Add ability to pass option flags to ActorIterator to enable searching non-active levels

* Moved the Hamming-weight function from StaticMeshDrawList.inl to FGenericPlatformMath Added SSE versions using _mm_popcnt_u64 for platforms that support it Added a SSE check to gracefully exit when missing the instruction and it was expected to be there

* Added feature to allow for calculating final Light Map Resolution for the output Static Mesh from Merging Actors according to the input Static Mesh Light Map resolutions.

* Adding ability to add custom row and properties to categories for detail customizations.

* Renamed "Find in CB" toolbar button to "Browse" and renamed "Search" (in Blueprints) to "Find", so terminology is consistent and keyboard shortcuts make sense (Ctrl+B for Browse, Ctrl+F for Find)

* Bug Fix: Fixed clothing meshes sometimes not drawing from certain angles when the clothing tools were in paint mode, as the mesh bounds were being computed incorrectly.

* Bug Fix: Fixed merging negative-scaled actors breaking the mesh normals

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when specifying too large texture size for Bake Material tool.

* Bug Fix: Fixed issue with Bake Out Material not updating data used for texture streaming, causing ensure.

* Bug Fix: You can only select AnimSequence or AnimComposite on the property window of track.

### Gameplay Framework

* New: Cross-level Actor references are now better supported, using SoftObjectPath and SoftObjectPtr (called Soft Object Reference in Blueprints). As part of this, FStringAssetReference and TAssetPtr were renamed to FSoftObjectPath and TSoftObjectPtr.

	If you create a SoftObjectPtr property pointing to an Actor or subclass, they will have an improved UI that will show rather they are unloaded or broken, as well as the full Actor ID they point to. Cross level references like this will now correctly be fixed up if the pointed to actor is renamed or moved using the "Move to current level" option. It will attempt to check out and resave any other levels/sequences that point to that specific actor. They will also work correctly in PIE when level streaming is used.

* Draw box around Actor being debugged by 'ShowDebug' command, to help identify what we're viewing.

* Allow Scale to be set on an AnimNotify as well as the spawn emitter gameplay statics

* Add ToString Blueprint functions for SoftObjectReference/SoftClassReference/PrimaryAssetId/PrimaryAssetType to assist in debugging

* USceneComponent::ComponentToWorld has now been made private per the previous deprecation message.

* Change the way that PIE networking works so the sent paths strip the PIE prefix and restore on load. This allows connecting a PIE client/server to an external non-PIE client/server.

* Change it so Standalone PIE and multiprocess networked PIE do not save temporary levels starting with UEDPC and instead prompt the user to save. This is how Launch On works by default already, and this fixes several cross level reference and sequencer bugs.

* Added GetKeysForAxis() to complement GetKeysForAction() in UPlayerInput

* Add support for downloading Chunks on demand to the Asset Manager, if they are set up for your project. AcquireResourcesForAssetList can be used to predownload chunks, and chunks will be downloaded on demand if bShouldAcquireMissingChunksOnLoad is true in the Asset Manager Settings

* Add FCollectionReference type and customization that allows selecting a Collection in the editor. Add one to PrimaryAssetLabel so it will label all assets in a Collection

* Small optimization to CleanupActors

* Reduced memory footprint of UActorComponent, USceneComponent, UPrimitiveComponent, UMeshComponent, UStaticMeshComponent, and UParticleSystemComponent.

* UStaticMeshComponent::StaticMesh has completed being made private. Use Get/SetStaticMesh() instead.

* AHUD::GetOwningPlayerController and GetOwningPawn are now public accessors.

* Added FTransform::TransformRotation(FQuat) and FTransform::InverseTransformRotation(FQuat). Added matching Blueprint library functions taking FRotator. (Contributed by EverNewJoy).

* Active force feedback effects and components can now ignore time dilation.

* Added console command to disable URO interpolation.

* Exposed GetAzimuthAndElevation to Blueprints.

* Bug Fix: Removed call to DebugCanvas->Flush_GameThread(); to fix 'showdebug' commands not rendering anymore.

* Bug Fix: Fix several crashes that could happen while attempting to use Play in Editor in less common configurations

* Bug Fix: Child Actors created by transient child actor components are now correctly created as transient. Note that this will not remove existing Actors that had been saved in to maps inadvertently.

* Bug Fix: Marked ULevelStreaming as Within=World, since various places already assume it

* Bug Fix: Fix several issues with loading the same asset twice in a row with Asset Manager.

* Bug Fix: All components will now clear the component need end of frame update mark when unregistered, not just primitive components.

* Bug Fix: Added GetTargetRotation() to SpringArmComponent, which returns the rotation target based on the combination of various rotation setting flags (bUsePawnControlRotation, bInheritPitch, bInheritYaw, bInheritRoll, absolute rotation flags). Use this instead of querying the SpringArmComponent's own rotation, which isn't changed at runtime.

* Bug Fix: Reduced memory churn/allocations when duplicating an Actor's components for PIE.

* Bug Fix: Fixed comment in GetComponents (UActorComponent version), which was referencing wrong component type.

* Bug Fix: Fixed issues where lighting could be unbuilt when reloading packages.

* Bug Fix: Renamed USceneComponent::bWorldToComponentUpdated to bComponentToWorldUpdated (since the transform is called ComponentToWorld).

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when SpawnObject has a null class passed to it.

### Localization

* New: In-Editor Localization Preview

* Bug Fix: Fixed some crashes where IMEs would try and access a deleted widget

* Bug Fix: Fixed high memory usage when using certain IMEs

* Bug Fix: Fixed abnormally long PO export times under certain circumstances

* Bug Fix: Fixed iOS not detecting the locale correctly

### Networking

* New: Added experimental network encryption functionality.

    * This is handled by a new packet handler component in the AESHandlerComponent plugin.

    * This component depends on another new plugin, PlatformCrypto, which wraps basic encryption algorithms implemented either by APIs provided by the platform, or by OpenSSL.

    * Net connections and their packet handler objects are now aware of encryption components, and have new functions to allow setting the encryption key.

    * When connecting to a game server, a custom token can be exchanged. This token may be used to obtain the actual encryption key for the connection.

* UdpMessaging: Not showing warning message if tunnel settings left empty to use defaults

* Messaging: Waking up message router thread on shutdown

* Messaging: Moved common helper classes into MessagingCommon module

* Merged over the change to expose more of dormancy to Blueprints (UE-46240)

* Enable the TCPMessaging plugin on platforms other than Windows/Mac so it can be used for profiling/automation, and fix several platform-specific bugs. If this is not desired, you should disable the plugin for your project.

* Add support for -TcpMessagingListen=IP:port and -TcpMessagingConnect=IP:Port command line options to the TCP messaging layer used for automation and profiling, this allows manually connecting to specific devices

* Added some additional stat instrumentation to the low-level network replication code. This may help track down replication performance issues when viewing ue4stats files in the Profiler.

* It is now possible to configure the UDP socket buffer sizes that the IpNetDriver requests of the operating system when creating a new connection.

* Bug Fix: Networking: Fixed nullpointer crash in TcpListener if socket initialization fails

* Bug Fix: NBOSerializer security fixes to protect against possible overflow in the values

* Bug Fix: Fixed client assert when trying to send RPCs while connection is pending closure due to queued bunches. ChIndex is -1 during this time, though the channel is not actually closed. Added ensure when calling SendBunch() under this condition to catch future cases like this.

* Bug Fix: Fix issue where nonblocking BSD sockets on some platforms may return EINPROGRESS on initial connect, which should not be treated as an error

* Bug Fix: AActor::PreReplication is now called prior to RPCs when they would have triggered initial replication.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where connecting to a Server that had deleted startup actors and then unloaded their sub level would cause a crash.

* Bug Fix: Fix to update actor replication stats even when the connection is currently saturated.

* Bug Fix: APawn::IsNetRelevantFor properly checks AGameNetworkManager::bUseDistanceBasedRelevancy.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a rare issue where the data stored in network replays could be corrupted, potentially causing a crash when the replay is played back.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue when the server is paused, the clients were not getting the update that it had happened.

* Bug Fix: Changes were made to FTcpListener and FTcpMessageTransportConnection to prevent them from polling sockets in a thread while waiting for connections or data. This improves performance on Android clients when launched from the editor and should also benefit other systems using FTcpListener.

* Bug Fix: Removing unnecessary conditional in WheeledVehicleMovementComponent.

* Bug Fix: Removed duplicated forward declaration in VehicleAnimInstance.h

* Bug Fix: Fixed Capsules where axis length (half-height - radius) < 1 were clamped to a new capsule with axis length of 1. Changed the clamp threshold to 1e-4 and changed FPhysXShapeAdaptor to use a Sphere instead when Radius >= HalfHeight.

    * This would cause sweeps using the capsule params to use a capsule of a different size, up to 1 UU different along the axis.

    * Moved hardcoded limits on FCollisionShape extents to a static value and refactored external code to reference that instead.

* The iOS signing process has been simplified when using the remote toolchain from PC. It is no longer necessary to to have any signing certificates or private keys installed on the remote Mac. It is now sufficient to have the certificates and keys installed on the PC and configured in the IOS section of the Project Settings.

* Addition of asset catalogs for application icons on IOS 11. When utilizing Xcode 9, the build tools will now create and compile an asset catalog composed of the application icons. This catalog is required when uploading the application to the store. Users can still specify their icons in the IOS Project Settings as normal and the location of the those files has not changed. They are automatically copied in to the asset catalog at build time.

* The editor now defaults to building 64-bit only executables for iOS. This change has been made to be compatible with iOS 11 and it's 64-bit only policy. Source users can still build 32-bit executables by updating the 32-bit build variables in their configuration files.

* Bug Fix: Fixed case sensitivity issue in FWindowsPlatformProcess::IsApplicationRunning.

### Programming

* New IPlatformFile::FindFiles and IPlatformFile::FindFilesRecursively are much more efficient than other methods for finding files in packaged games.

* Windows CHM file is no longer included within the installed engine release, due to size limits of the format. A cross-platform compressed HTML archive is still available in the Engine/Documentation/Builds subfolder for offline viewing.

* Added: a new RHI function to invalidate/clear cached state - RHIInvalidateCachedState(). Currently has implementation only for OpenGL. This could be used by plugin developers to inform RHI that current state has been changed outside of RHI.

* Added t.DumpHitches.AllThreads so all threads are dumped when doing 'stat dumphitches'

* Bug Fix: ULevelStreamingKismet::LoadLevelInstance function is now exposed to game code

### Rendering

* New: Remove rendering support code in MetalRHI for Mac OS X El Capitan (10.11) - MetalRHI now requires macOS Sierra (10.12) to function on Mac.

* Extended ExternalTexture to support 2x3 transform (scale/rotation + offset)

* Make all Metal shader platforms compiled with Metal version 1.2 or later compile such that half may be used, unless the material specifies full precision.

* PR #3714: Fix typo in EOcclusionCombineMode (Contributed by Mumbles4)

* Where available use Metal's new CaptureManager to provide additional capture options in Xcode's GPU frame capture tool to capture more than one frame at a time.

* Added Render Target Pool Stats. Use "stat rendertargetpool" on the in-game console to view.

* Updated Vulkan headers to SDK 1.0.57.0

* Integrating the MIT-licensed mtlpp C++ Metal wrapper from Nikolay Aleksiev which will eventually replace previous Metal API wrappers in MetalRHI once it has been extended to support all the features required.

* Support disabling V-Sync in MetalRHI on macOS 10.13+.

* Added a command-line option "-MetalRuntimeDebugLevel=X" (where X is a number 0-8, defined in MetalContext.cpp) to specify the amount of runtime validation of Metal operations that MetalRHI will perform over and above Xcode's validation layer. For macOS level 5 and above will attempt to emit GPU instructions such that if a command-buffer fails the error report will indicate the last successfully completed debug-group.

* HDR logic refactor - simplify enable/disable logic, particularly on console. This add a high level r.AllowHDR cvar to enable/disable HDR on a per-platform or per-title basis. (This is a breaking change, since it defaults to off.). By default, the user setting now default to true on Console. Instead, we rely on the OS to determine HDR capability

* D3D12: Enable GPU validation if -d3d12gpuvalidation is passed on the commandline

* Allow disabling of display V-Sync in Metal on macOS 10.13+ when running in true fullscreen mode (not windowed or windowed-fullscreen). This stops synchronizing frame presentation with the display, so can be slightly faster but will tear visibly as it does on all other platforms.

* Bug Fix: Fixed cloth rendering on Metal by changing the way FClothVertex is loaded. Some of the data in FClothVertex needs to be treated as uint data and loading it as floats was exposing a difference in behavior between some Metal drivers and Direct3D.

* Bug Fix: Moved RHISupportsMSAA and add the necessary conditions for when it is available on Metal (AMD & Nvidia for macOS 10.13+, Mobile Renderer for iOS).

* Bug Fix: Rework handling of various Metal intrinsics and implement a full fused-multiply-add optimization pass within hlslcc to ensure greater consistency of results between different Metal shaders motivated by changes to the behavior of Apple's Metal compiler.

* Bug Fix: Fixed iOS builds picking up the Mac's Metal shader standard setting which caused the wrong shaders to be compiled.

* Bug Fix: Fixed lighting in VR Forward rendering on Nvidia GPUs under macOS by changing how we load the ForwardLocalLightBuffer data to avoid a difference in behavior between some Metal drivers and Direct3D.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an intermittent crash launching games into fullscreen on macOS caused by deleting the render targets before they should be and correcting specification of some render-target load-actions.

* Bug Fix: Fixed Pixel Inspector not working on Mac by implementing the missing CopySubTextureRegion function in MetalRHI.

* Bug Fix: Improve the handling of features that are restricted to certain Mac/iOS & Metal versions in Editor UI and the way the Editor handles the absence of the native Metal shader-compiler.

    * Disable half floats for Metal v1.0 & Metal v1.1 - too many shaders just don't compile anymore for no apparent reason - this will only get worse as the compiler stack advances.

    * Change the Editor code to ensure that cooking without access to the native Metal shader compiler does not pollute the DerivedDataCache for other users.

    * The global clip plane implies clip_distance support which on A8 devices requires iOS 10.

    * The Desktop Forward renderer for iOS requires Metal v1.2 and iOS 10.

* Bug Fix: Rework the error reporting for remote shader compilation so that the correct error message is actually reported when the native Metal compiler is not available.

* Bug Fix: Fix rendering of shaders that use World-Position-Offset on Metal platforms by extensive use of newer intrinsics.

* Bug Fix: Change an assert in the Metal shader translator that fires whenever a float literal is NaN or an otherwise unhandled non-finite value to a compiler warning that can be debugged as NaN/INF literals will be incorrect on all platforms.

* Bug Fix: Fix a crash when switching between normal and Mobile Preview rendering modes in the Editor on Mac.

* Bug Fix: Fix the incorrect velocity & motion-blur rendering in the Desktop Forward renderer on A8 iOS devices (e.g. iPhone 6/6+), the Desktop Forward renderer is now minimally functional on these older iOS devices but will be slow as it is much more demanding than the Mobile Renderer.

* Bug Fix: Fixed project thumbnails on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Fixed RHILockVertexBuffer on DX12 to work properly with and without RHI commandlist.

* Bug Fix: Emit only one declaration for system provided shader variables for Metal as sometimes we end up with multiple specifications for some volumetric fog shaders.

* Bug Fix: Protect against invalid copysubresource bounds. Protects against GPU crashes on some drivers.

* Bug Fix: Fix black flickering on some materials that use World Position Offset - the Metal sincos intrinsic comes into two flavours for single precision floats and we want the precise version not the fast version but only for Vertex shaders.

* Bug Fix: Fix a crash on shutdown due to MetalRHI caching vertex-declarations beyond the lifetime of the RHI by moving the cache into the FMetalDynamicRHI itself.

* Bug Fix: Fix D3D12 validation error when GBV is enabled, courtesy of Sebastian Merry at Microsoft

* Bug Fix: Avoid a Metal GPU driver bug by only emitting one clip-distance on Metal, when the global clip-plane is enabled this takes priority over all others as it is essential to function correctly, other uses are merely optimizations.

* Bug Fix: Fixed outline in editor missing on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Rebuilt IntelISPCTexComp with Visual Studio 2015 to remove dependency on VS2013 redist.

* Bug Fix: Precomputed visibility on components added through a Blueprint will now correctly be retained when reloading a level.

#### FX

* Bug Fix: Prevent crashes when UNiagaraComponent::GetEffectDataInterface is called on a component with no effect asset set

* Bug Fix: Fixed life-time fading on deferred decals.

#### Lighting

* Disable r.GenerateLandscapeGIData by default, opt-in for kite demo. Projects that want to use heightfield GI need to opt-in to r.GenerateLandscapeGIData.

* Added 'Render Unbuilt Preview Shadows in game' rendering project setting and r.Shadow.UnbuiltPreviewInGame console variable

* Swarm hands out the most expensive tasks in roughly a round robin ordering among distribution agents. Lightmass processing of a single task is multithreaded, so ideally the most expensive tasks are evenly distributed among active agents. This has the biggest impact in small scenes with 10's of high resolution lightmaps, and with a distribution farm. Build time in one scene went from to 113s -> 47s.

* Allow masked dynamic shadows to be cast by translucent materials, based on a threshold opacity value.

* Volume materials on every component type except particle sprites now voxelize the mesh's Object space bounding box, allowing more control over the shape of fog added and better performance when adding ground density.

* Bug Fix: Enable PCSS on Vulkan & Metal and enable capsule shadows on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Only use skylight OcclusionMaxDistance for the global distance field if it casts shadows

* Bug Fix: Fixed shadow occlusion culling broken by shadowmap caching change.

* Bug Fix: Fixed spotlight whole scene shadow occlusion queries using a radius 2x too long

* Bug Fix: Fix for movable skylight shader missing on simple forward (low lighting quality mode)

* Bug Fix: Fixed ObjectRadius in Volume domain materials

* Bug Fix: Dynamic Indirect Occlusion from mesh distance fields is disabled when operating on a movable skylight, since Distance Field Ambient Occlusion fills that role

* Bug Fix: Exposed EmissiveBoost, since Lightmass supports Emissive areas on meshes

* Bug Fix: VolumetricScatteringIntensity is greyed out based on Mobility

#### Materials

* Moved UTexture material notification code into separate function, so it can be used by derived classes.

* Improved streaming support for AO textures and lighting scenarios.
Improved resolution metrics in the texture editor.
Added a new editor command "BuildMaterialTextureStreamingData" to refresh material texture streaming data.

* Removed the 1945MB VRAM cap in DX11 and DX12 when running 64 bit builds. Non console platforms will now allocate non streaming texture outside the texture pool if there is enough free VRAM available. This improves the behavior and maintainability of low texture settings.

* Bug Fix: Fixed some cases where material instances would be treated as masked instead of opaque as intended.

* Bug Fix: Fixed behavior of custom material attribute display names and function names.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where some materials would overstream some textures.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where textures would stay at low resolution following a memory usage spike.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue when building the DDC for composite textures where the texture sources would be missing.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a case where parameters behind a static switch would be invisible in a material instance.

#### Mobile Rendering

* Exposed "Use Full Precision" for UI materials, which can be used to improve precision at performance cost in UI pixel shaders on mobile devices.

* Added support for Vulkan validation layers on Android. Only in Debug and Development configuration (requires r.Vulkan.EnableValidation=1)

* Vertex Fog is disabled on Mobile by default. This saves a number of instruction in base pass shaders.

* Bug Fix: Correct tracking of static mesh index memory.

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Decals on mobile devices should not disappear when there is planar reflection in the view

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Protostar in Vulkan mode crashes without error on Tegra K1 Nvidia Shield due to OOM - fixed r.MobileReduceLoadedMips has no effect - added r.MobileMaxLoadedMips to set a limit to a number of mips - reduced size of vulkan allocation pages on android

* Bug Fix: Fixed a problem which could cause the Scene Depth material node to return 0 on some mobile devices.

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Crash after Splash Screen on Android (ETC2) when Adding r.UseShaderCaching and r.UseShaderPredraw - Added r.SaveShaderCache command to save current cache on demand - Removed support for caching multiple platforms at the same time, each platform now uses separate cache/file - Significantly reduced size of draw log on disk - Mobile platforms support only basic caching, logging shaders and bound shader states without full gfx state

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Usage of dynamic shadows leads to application crash on Galaxy S7 device (SM-G930V) when project packaged with Vulkan support.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue where streaming in or out levels each with their own stationary directional lights could cause the lighting system to lose track of which lights are loaded and surfaces be lit incorrectly

* Bug Fix: Fixed upside down triangle rendering with UCanvas::K2_DrawMaterialTriangle on OpenGL ES devices.

#### Optimizations

* New: Removed render thread stalls and improved reactivity when streaming mips for 2D textures.

* New project settings to globally disable/enable creation of depth-only and reversed index buffers.

* Added: Async loading bytecode from shader library. Along with bytecode de-duplication shader library will now pre-load requested bytecode to ensure there are no disk access related hitches in game when creating shaders.

* Cloth vertex buffers no longer generate dummy vertices, which reduces runtime memory usage of skeletal meshes with multiple sections of which only one has cloth.

* Fixed lights calling InvalidateLightingCache on Destroy in game, causing a hitch

* Fixed UWorld::DestroyActor in PIE calling InvalidateLightingCacheDetailed which can do a FlushRenderingCommands and cause a large hitch

* Snap volumetric fog light function target resolution to a factor of 32 to avoid constant texture reallocation

* Added SendAllEndOfFrameUpdates draw event to wrap skin cache events

* When compiling shaders for Metal explicitly emit the early-fragment-test qualifier unless the fragment shader invokes discard() or explicitly writes a depth-output semantic, this should better match driver behavior on Direct3D.

* Optimise the constant-propagation pass in hlslcc by using a hash-table to reduce the cost of looking up the existing constant assignment instructions.

* Vulkan will not use staging memory for dynamic vertex/index buffers on devices with unified memory access

* Implement support for the SV_DepthLessEqual semantic in Metal.

* Optimizations to reduce MetalRHI CPU overheads:

    * Avoid reallocating memory by making the TArray of uniform buffers a static C-array instead.

    * Use count-trailing-zero's intrinsics to eliminate redundant iterations over the set of bound resources.

* Small optimizations to MetalRHI primarily for iOS: - Only buffers less than a platform-specific threshold are uploaded via Metal's set*Bytes API to balance CPU overheads (on iOS this is 512 bytes, on Mac it is 4096 bytes). - Increase the minimum pool sizes for MTLBuffer's to reflect this. - Avoid redundantly rebinding uniform buffers in MetalRHI.

* Rewrite of the Vulkan pipeline cache: Multiple files can now be read off projectdir/Build/ShaderCaches/Platform folders; cache files are now compressed with rates of up to 70-90% off the original size.

* Bug Fix: Fixes for profilegpu on Vulkan

* Bug Fix: Discard now gets called on BulkData on D3D11, D3D12 and Vulkan.

#### Postprocessing

* Improve performance of bokeh depth of field.

### Tools

* New: Improved XGE shader compiler. - Added support for XGE interception interface, which allows asynchronous streaming of shader tasks into XGE, and eliminates the stalling/flushing found in the old system. The old system has been renamed "Xml interface". - Both systems are available and selectable based on r.XGEShaderCompile.Mode CVar. Overview of the new system: - New system uses an additional XGEControlWorker process to manage communication between the engine and XGE. This is simply a copy of ShaderCompileWorker.exe (the implementation is part of SCW, but XGE requires the two files to be separate, hence the duplicate). - When shader jobs arrive from the engine, the shader compiler thread spawns an instance of XGEControlWorker within an XGE context, and connects to it via named pipes. - Job command lines are fed to the control worker via the pipe, which the worker enqueues within XGE by issuing a CreateProcess call, which is intercepted. Job completion is reported back to the engine via the named pipes. - New system is preferred over the old one, and is enabled with "-xgeshadercompile" command line switch or "r.XGEShaderCompile" cvar. - The new system depends on the "XGEController" engine module. Support for which is based on the WITH_XGE_CONTROLLER #define, or -xgecontroller/-noxgecontroller command line options.

* Added an option in the Texture browser to allow a texture to override the default compression quality. This has an effect for textures compressed as PVRTC or ASTC.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a condition where cooking DLC would cook all maps even if specific maps were specified.

#### AutomationTool

* Added support for pre-build and post-build steps when using MegaXGE.

* Added validation against shipping files in restricted folders. * Added a new SystemNonUFS type for staged files, which excludes files from being remapped or renamed by the platform layer. * Replaced the DeplyomentContext.StageFiles() function with simpler overloads for particular use cases (options for remapping are replaced with the SystemNonUFS file type) * Config entries in the [Staging] category in DefaultGame.ini file allow remapping one directory to another, so restricted content can be made public in packaged builds (Example syntax: +RemapDirectory=(From="Foo/NoRedist", To="Foo")) * An error is output if any restricted folder names other than the output platform are in the staged output.

* The -submit or -nosubmit arguments are only passed to child instances of UAT if they were specified on the original command line. BuildCookRun uses this flag to determine whether to submit, rather than just whether to allow submitting, so we shouldn't pass an inferred value.

* Added a -SkipHeader parameter to the UpdateLocalVersion command, to allow updating version files without updating Version.h and improve link times on incremental builds.

* During staging, we now create a manifest for each PAK file containing all the plugin descriptors in one place. Eliminates need to recurse through directories and read separate multiple files in serial at startup, and allows reading all plugin descriptors with one read. The "Mods" directory is excluded from the manifest, since these are intended to be installed separately by the user.

* Removed the -ForceLocal command line option. Settings are now always determined automatically if not set via environment variables, independently of the -BuildMachine argument.

* Simplified logic for detecting Perforce settings, using environment variables if they are set, otherwise falling back to detecting them. Removes special cases for build machines, and makes it simpler to set up UAT commands on builders outside Epic.

* Packaging a plugin will now force include what you use to be enabled. Since plugins distributed on the marketplace will be moved into the engine folder, they need to be IWYU compatible.

* Bug Fix: Fixed incorrect username in BuildGraph <Submit> task. Should use the username from the Perforce environment, not assume the logged in user name is the same.

* Bug Fix: Formatting in JSON output from C# tools now matches formatting used by the engine.

* Bug Fix: When patching temporary files are now put in the correct directories. Thanks David Yerkess @ Milestone

* Bug Fix: Fixed executable not being recompiled for a content-only project if a plugin which is enabled by default is disabled.

#### BuildGraph

* Added an example script to package ShooterGame for any platforms.

* Improved tracing for error messages. All errors are now propagated as exceptions, and are tagged with additional context information about the task currently being run. For example, throwing new AutomationException("Unable to write foo.txt") from SetVersionTask.Execute is now displayed in the log as: ERROR: Unable to write to foo.txt while executing <SetVersion Change="0" CompatibleChange="0" Branch="Unknown" Promoted="True" /> at Engine\Build\InstalledEngineBuild.xml(91) (see D:\P4 UE4\Engine\Programs\AutomationTool\Saved\Logs\UAT_Log.txt for full exception trace)

* Added support for nullable parameter types.

#### UnrealBuildTool

* Added support for adaptive non-unity builds when working from a Git repository. The ISourceFileWorkingSet interface is now used to query files belonging to the working set, and has separate implementations for Perforce (PerforceSourceFileWorkingSet) and Git (GitSourceFileWorkingSet). The Git implementation is used if a .git directory is found in the directory containing the Engine folder, the directory containing the project file, or the parent directory of the project file, and spawns a "git status" process in the background to determine which files are untracked or staged. Several new settings are supported in BuildConfiguration.xml to allow modifying default behavior:

		<SourceFileWorkingSet> <Provider>Default</Provider> <!-- May be None, Default, Git or Perforce -->
			<RepositoryPath></RepositoryPath> <!-- Specifies the path to the repository, relative to the directory containing the Engine folder. If not set, tries to find a .git directory in the locations listed above. -->
			<GitPath>git</GitPath> <!-- Specifies the path to the Git executable. Defaults to "git", which assumes that it will be on the PATH -->
		</SourceFileWorkingSet>

* Simplified how targets are cleaned. Delete all intermediate folders for a platform/configuration, and delete any build products matching the UE4 naming convention for that target, rather than relying on the current build configuration or list of previous build products. This will ensure that build products which are no longer being generated will also be cleaned.

* A <ExeName>.version file is now created for every target built by UBT in the same JSON format as Engine/Build/Build.version. This allows monolithic targets to read a version number at runtime, unlike when it's embedded in a .modules file, and allows creating versioned client executables that will work with versioned servers when syncing through UnrealGameSync.

* Use P/Invoke to determine number of physical processors on Windows rather than using WMI. Starting up WMIC adds 2.5 seconds to build times, and is not compatible with .NET core.

* Added support for declaring custom pre-build steps and post-build steps from .target.cs files. Similarly to the custom build steps configurable from .uproject and .uplugin files, these specify commands which will be executed by the host platform's shell before or after a build. The following variables are expanded within the list of commands before execution: $(EngineDir), $(ProjectDir), $(TargetName), $(TargetPlatform), $(TargetConfiguration), $(TargetType), $(ProjectFile). Example usage: public class UnrealPakTarget : TargetRules { public UnrealPakTarget(TargetInfo Target) : base(Target) { Type = TargetType.Program; LinkType = TargetLinkType.Monolithic; LaunchModuleName = "UnrealPak"; if(HostPlatform == UnrealTargetPlatform.Win64) { PreBuildSteps.Add("echo Before building:"); PreBuildSteps.Add("echo This is $(TargetName) $(TargetConfiguration) $(TargetPlatform)"); PostBuildSteps.Add("echo After building!"); PostBuildSteps.Add("echo This is $(TargetName) $(TargetConfiguration) $(TargetPlatform)"); } } }

* The user's preferred source code IDE selected in the editor is now used to generate project files.

* Bug Fix: UnrealHeaderTool will now be re-run if the .build.cs file for a module has changed.

* Bug Fix: Fixed incorrect MSBuild version occasionally being used when invoking UnrealBuildTool.

* Bug Fix: Removed the dependency on the ShaderCompileWorker project when running with generating project files with the -useprecompiled argument.

* Bug Fix: Fixed hot reload generating import libraries without DLLs. Now that they are produced by separate actions by default, it was removing DLLs from the action graph due to the bSkipLinkingWhenNothingToCompile setting.

* Bug Fix: Fixed UBT stack size not being propagated through to the toolchain from the target settings.

* Bug Fix: Files in output directories which match build products in other output directories are now deleted. Prevents slate binaries from being loaded when a module is moved.

* Bug Fix: Fixed unchanged modules always being relinked with VS2017 15.3

#### UnrealGameSync

* Added variables for stream and client name, and the ability to escape any variables for URIs using the syntax $(VariableName:URI).

* Allow adding custom actions to the context menu for right clicking on a changelist. Actions are specified in the project's UnrealEngine.ini file, with the following syntax: +ContextMenu=(Label="This is the menu item", Execute="foo.exe", Arguments="bar") The standard set of variables for custom tools is expanded in each parameter (eg. $(ProjectDir), $(EditorConfig), etc...), plus the $(Change) variable.

* Always sync the Enterprise folder if the selected .uproject file has the "Enterprise" flag set.

* If working in a virtual stream, use the name of the first non-virtual ancestor for writing version files.

* Added additional search paths for UGS config files, and fix a few cosmetic issues (inability to display ampersands in tools menu, showing changelist -1 when running a tool without syncing). Config files are now read from: Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/UnrealGameSync.ini Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/NotForLicensees/UnrealGameSync.ini If a project is selected: <ProjectDir>/Build/UnrealGameSync.ini <ProjectDir>/Build/NotForLicensees/UnrealGameSync.ini If the .uprojectdirs file is selected: Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/DefaultProject.ini Engine/Programs/UnrealGameSync/NotForLicensees/DefaultProject.ini

* Project files are no longer generated when syncing precompiled binaries.

* The user's server settings are now read by spawning P4.EXE from the directory containing the project being opened, so people can override the P4PORT setting on a per-workspace basis using a P4CONFIG file.

* Added support for custom post-sync actions. These cannot be configured per-user, but are set by the project configuration file. Since they are always executed, they should be fast and reliable. Example additions to an UnrealGameSync.ini file: [Sync] +Step=(FileName="cmd.exe", Arguments="/C echo Change=$(Change), CodeChange=$(CodeChange), BranchDir=$(BranchDir)")

* Added support for predefined categories of files to exclude from being synced. The "Sync Filter" dialog now shows a list of these categories as well as the custom view that was previously supported. Several built-in categories are defined, for various target platforms, documentation, and so on. Each category is identified by a GUID, and projects may add or modify existing categories through the <ProjectDir>/Build/UnrealGameSync.ini config file. Config file entries are formatted as follows: +SyncCategory=(UniqueId="{00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000}", Name="Name of this Category", Enable=true/false, Clear=true/false, Paths="/Path1/...;/Path2/...") All fields other than the UniqueId are optional. Specify Enable=false to prevent the filter from being applied or shown to the user. Specify Clear=true when modifying an existing category to clear the existing paths rather than append new paths. Specify the list of patterns to be filtered out separated by semicolons.

* Bug Fix: Changed to use the default Perforce server port when opening P4V if there is not one set in the environment.

* Bug Fix: Fix tab names setting not being correctly read back in from config file.

* Bug Fix: Fixed build configuration not correctly being updated to reflect changes on other tabs.

* Bug Fix: Fix directory separators not being normalized before filtering files for sync. If the workspace root directory has non-native separators (eg. D:/P4), they will be propagated to the file list.

* Bug Fix: Fixed crash when switching streams to a stream that does not contain the current project file.

* Bug Fix: Reparse points (symlinks) are no longer enumerated when recursively deleting directories. This could cause the contents of the linked directory to be deleted rather than the symlink itself, and can cause crashes if the symlink is to an outer directory.

#### UnrealVS

* Bug Fix: Fixed setting the command line to empty not affecting the underlying property sheet.

* Bug Fix: Fix single-file compilation for foreign projects, where the command line contains $(SolutionDir) and $(ProjectName) variables.

### UI

* Disabled the skeletal mesh's "Use async scene" property if the current project is not set to use an async scene, as this property will have no effect otherwise. A warning is shown on the property if the project does not currently use an async scene.
 A similar warning will be shown in the physics asset editor in the near future.

* Disabled viewport post processing when in cloth painting mode on clothing assets, to make the paint colours more easily distinguishable.

* Bug Fix: Stopped property context menus closing the whole window stack when an item is clicked

* Bug Fix: Improve PhAT UI to stop showing convex bodies as editable, as they currently contain no editable properties.

* Bug Fix: Fixed "Use Internal" button for Soundwave curves being too large.

* Bug Fix: Fixed various dropdown menus in the cloth asset creation popup not hiding themselves when the input focus is lost.

* Bug Fix: Fix for custom rows having their "is enabled" attribute stomped.

* Bug Fix: Force low quality mode for background blurs by default on android

* Bug Fix: Force low quality fallback mode on ES2 devices for slate blur widgets. This feature does not work on es2

* Bug Fix: Prevent resizing when a context menu is open. This prevents a number of rare crashes when a window is resized when a child menu is open.

* Bug Fix: Converted remaining uses of EKeyboardFocusCause to EFocusCause and properly deprecated it

* Bug Fix: Fix issues with marking a widget Blueprint class as abstract

* Bug Fix: Added a console variable to prevent touch events from sending multiple bogus mouse events. Disabled by default. Enabling this will prevent pen tablets from working but may be necessary for touch events to work in windows 7.

#### Slate

* Added search to editable texts

    * This can be invoked by selecting some text and using Ctrl+(Shift+)F3 to begin a search, and then using (Shift+)F3 to move through the matches.

    * It can also be done in code by calling BeginSearch and AdvanceSearch on an editable text.

* Added bApplyWidgetStyleToMenu to SMenuAnchor - if false, the popup is given a default FWidgetStyle when painted. This allows the menu to ignore the inherited tint and opacity, so a faded button can still summon a fully opaque menu.

* Bug Fix: Added a lock around access to slate active timers to protect it against race conditions when accessed on the slate movie thread and the game thread

* Bug Fix: Fixed issue where undocked tabs had no way to be made visible again after being hidden

#### UMG

* Bug Fix: UMG: Apply latent actions like in movie scene sequence player.

* Bug Fix: Scroll Widget Into View will now work for widgets not directly parented to a scroll box.

* Reduce memory footprint of somd UMG/Slate classes including UWidget, UBorder, UUserWidget, SWidget, and SButton

### XR

* Debug stereo layer support. This adds an option to render the debug canvas to a stereo layer which greatly improves console and stat readability in an hmd.

* Updated OpenVR SDK to 1.0.10.

* Bug Fix: Editor primitives we not being handled correctly with ISR.

* Bug Fix: Adding ISR and multiview support for custom depth. This fixes z-fighting that can occur between the custom depth pass and pre/base pass when the custom depth pass doesn't use ISR/multiview.

* Bug Fix: PR #3997: Fix quad buffer stereo crash in Windows (Contributed by ayamashev)

#### VR

* Added support for non-parallel projections for HMDs that have canted display panels

* Split interface for handling custom render targets from IStereoRendering into its own interface and unified common code between different VR platforms into a single base implementation class.

* Adding core VR controller re-centering delegate notification. Users can now use this delegate via the VRNotificationsComponent

* Adding in support for the SteamVR Knuckles controllers

* Code applying late updates has been unified across different VR platforms, reducing code duplication and unifying behavior.

* Added in SteamVR visible area mesh support. Can be toggled with vr.SteamVR.UseVisibleAreaMesh

* Updating SteamVR libraries to 1.10

* Oculus changes for SI1.16 and SI1.17 Adds Vulkan and D3D12 improvements/fixes for VR, depth target allocation for VR plugins, Android thread naming and a number of new Oculus features.

* Added Vulcan Extensions for OculusVR

* UE-47210 VR Mode in-Editor Viewport Camera is misaligned with HMD camera -Added calculation of the point on the render target directly in front of your eyes based on the HMD's projection matrix. -This is used by cropping spectator screen modes to adjust the cropping used to favor putting the eye center point in the center of the spectator screen. Oculus is most noticable as its center point is about .45 out of 1 from the top, rather than 0.5. -I also found that we were not successfuly detecting the aspect ratio of the spectator screen in windowed mode. We were using the render target aspect ratio, which is constant. Now we pass down the window size to get the correct aspect ratio.

* Updated library revision for GoogleVR

* Bug Fix: Fixed SpectatorScreen Flickering Fixed Spectator screen: need frame delay before assigning dynamically created rendertarget to spectator texture Fixed Spectator Screen: crash if you release a render target which is assigned as the spectator texture -Now I pull the Texture2DRHI out of the UTexture every frame and pass it to the render thread via a rendercommand. This has us getting it after it is created, and using it until the end of the current renderframe. -Note: scene capture components crash if you release their render target, so point them away from it first. -Note: this still leaves the possibility of setting a texture who's resources do not yet exist, or which have not been rendered to yet as the spectator screen texture. The spectator screen will, by default display all black if it doesn't find a resource at all. For debugging one can switch that to all white or breakpoint it in GetFallbackRHITexture().

* Bug Fix: Don't snap motion controllers to the origin when tracking is lost.

* Bug Fix: Vive spectator flat rect expanded to match other platforms.

* Bug Fix: PSVR Social Screen needs to go to 'mirroring' for hmd setup dialog because system dialogs are not visible in separate mode.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a regression causing splash screens on Oculus to be forced to a 16:9 aspect ratio regardless of the texture size used.

* Bug Fix: Fixed an issue with backwards compatibility, where the old XR module names (OculusRift, GearVR, etc.) still work with the command line and XR prioritization.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug that would modify the camera view unwantedly outside of VR, when the camera's LockToHMD option was enabled.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a crash that could occur when using a SteamVRChaperoneComponent on a XR platform other than SteamVR.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug where the in-game camera view could become vertically locked after playing in VR preview.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug with the Daydream controller model where the laser was rendering undersized.

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug with SteamVR on Mac where controller haptics would not fire.

* Bug Fix: Fix for Daydream 2D transition on Android Fix for Cardboard on Samsung S8 devices when not set to native resolution

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug on Oculus, where the tracking space's origin was being ignored/reset on initialization.

## UPGRADE NOTES

### AI

#### Navigation

* Bug Fix: Fixed: bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled was not always working when re-opening map in the Editor
Fixed: Navigation Build was not always clearing nav-mesh tiles when bNavigationAutoUpdateEnabled is enabled
Fixed: Streaming out a sub-level in the Editor was not always updating nav-mesh debug drawing

### Animation

#### Animation Blueprint

* USkeletalMeshComponet.bDisableAnimCurves is deprecated and converted to USkeletalMeshComponet.bAllowAnimCurveEvaluation. Note the meaning is reversed.

### Automation

* Moved functional testing automation commands to an exported helper.

### Blueprints

* Blueprint references to "Random Unit Vector in Cone" or "Random Unit Vector in Cone With Yaw and Pitch" will automatically be redirected, but function calls in code will not. See the Programmer Notes for technical instructions.

* *If your project's .uproject file contains an "AdditionalPluginDirectories" section with an entry listed as "Intermediate/Plugins", please remove that entry. If it is the only entry, it is safe to remove the entire section.*

    * In 4.17 we automatically added this entry to the .uproject file (only if it was writable) when you changed the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" option to something besides "Disabled" in Project settings->Packaging in the Editor UI. In 4.18 we've since removed this feature, as we found that it was causing issues with switching between nativized and non-nativized build workflows. Note that if it's not removed, those issues may persist.

* Most paths in the UE4 editor UI that cook and/or build the game now look to the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" option in Project settings->Packaging in the Editor UI in order to determine if Blueprint nativization should be enabled.

    * This means that if you've set that option to something other than "Disabled" for your project, any time you (or someone else working on the same project who you share the config files with) does something that cooks and/or builds the game, it will now do so with Blueprint nativization enabled.

    * This only applies to workflows that use "Cook by the book" mode. Blueprint nativization is not enabled with "Cook on the fly" mode, regardless of the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" setting.

    * One exception is the "Launch on <Device>" command. This command performs a "Cook by the Book" within the Editor process itself, and Blueprint nativization also cannot be enabled for cooking in that mode either.

    * Other situations that will currently always disable Blueprint nativization include when Cook on the Fly mode is used for launching a profile in the Project Launcher, and when a Blueprint-only project is launched through the Project Launcher using a binary (i.e. not built locally) version of the editor.

    * In the Project Launcher, you can create a custom Launch profile to override the current setting by adding the following into the "Additional Cook Options" field for the "Cook by the Book" settings: "-ini:Game:[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]:BlueprintNativizationMethod=<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>", replacing the "<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>" substring with one of those 3 available options.

* Bug Fix: Fix create object nodes failing to remove orphaned pins when connections to the orphaned pin are removed.

### Core

* FTimespan: The %D string formatter (previously total number of days) is now the zero-padded days component of the time span. Time spans are now always exported and stringified with a leading plus or minus sign.

* Modifying a TMap, TSet or TSparseArray while you are iterating over it with a ranged-for loop will now cause an assertion, matching the same behavior as TArray. If you need this functionality, you should change your loop to a traditional iterator loop:

		for (auto MyMapIter = MyMap.CreateIterator(); MyMapIter; ++MyMapIter)
		{
			if (RemoveElement(*MyMapIter))
			{
				MyMapIter.RemoveCurrent();
			}
		}

* Multiple MAX values will no longer be generated for UENUMs. Assets (including Blueprints) which refer to redundant MAX values will throw a warning about the missing value. These assets should be reexported to be saved with the new MAX value.

* Any custom C# projects (UAT plugins for example) should add a reference to the DotNETCommon assembly

* MoveTemp will no longer compile if passed an rvalue or a const lvalue. The code should either be fixed to not use const if possible, or the MoveTemp should be removed as it is redundant. Templates and macros can use MoveTempIfPossible when it's hard to tell if the argument is const - this follows the old behavior of MoveTemp.

* Bug Fix: Any references to FCoreUObjectDelegates::PreGarbageCollect/PostGarbageCollect delegates should be replaced with calls to FCoreUObjectDelegates::GetPreGarbageCollectDelegate() and FCoreUObjectDelegates::GetPostGarbageCollectDelegate() respectively

* Bug Fix: Fixed console output not working when using -log in a shipping build

### Gameplay Framework

* New: As part of the changes for cross-level actor references newly created Sequencer actor references are now SoftObjectPtrs, but older Sequences will have to be fixed up with "Rebind Possessable References" and resaved first.

* Scale can now be specified on play particle effect anim notify and spawn emitter Blueprint nodes.

* Remove advanced option CreateTemporaryCopiesOfLevels from the sequencer capture object, it has not worked properly in several versions.

* Bug Fix: UWorld functions PerformGarbageCollectionAndCleanupActors, DelayGarbageCollection, SetTimeUntilNextGarbageCollection, GetTimeBetweenGarbageCollectionPasses, and ForceGarbageCollection have been deprecated. The equivalent functions on GEngine should be used instead.

### Media Framework

* BREAKING: *MediaSoundWave* assets were replaced with *MediaSoundComponents*

    * There is no automatic conversion (components require different workflow & user decisions)

    * Attach new *MediaSoundComponents* to Actors or UMG widgets

    * Existing *MediaSoundWave* assets must be deleted from Content directory on disk

* BREAKING: *MediaPlayer* output settings were removed. Media assets now reference a *MediaPlayer* instead

* NEW: *MediaTexture* and *MediaSoundComponent* have a setting for the Media Player to pull data from

* NEW: *MediaAssets* module is now always loaded to prevent server-side BP problems

* NEW: Material texture samplers now require the new Sampler Type "External"

* NOTE: *MediaOverlay* assets were removed as a concept

    * We are currently reworking caption and subtitle support in UE4

### Online

* Any classes inheriting or making use of IOnlineTitleFile should be adjusted to take account of the new error string.

### Physics

* All UPrimitiveComponent and FBodyInstance deprecated functions will still work as they did before, but it's recommended that code using these functions is upgraded to call the newer ones. This should be as simple as following the instructions in the respective deprecation compiler warnings. Particular care should be taken when upgrading calls to FBodyInstance to ensure that the inputs are converted to the correct units expected by the new functions.

### Platforms

#### iOS

* Older project will need to open the editor and resave their IOS project settings .

### Rendering

* Projects requiring HDR support now need to set r.AllowHDR to 1 in their DefaultEngine.ini (or per-platform equivalents). Projects using HDR on consoles who want the feature to be off by default should modify DefaultGameUserSettings.ini to disable it.

#### Materials

* Bug Fix: Fixed behavior of custom material attribute display names and function names - The intention was to allow a display name and a separate name for use in the HLSL but one was being lost. Projects relying on the old behavior may need to update local shader modifications.

#### Mobile Rendering

* If your maps use Vertex Fog, Mobile preview and device will show on screen message: PROJECT HAS VERTEX FOG ON MOBILE DISABLED. Please open project settings and enable support for Vertex Fog in Mobile section.

* Bug Fix: Vulkan will pre-allocate less memory on mobile devices

* Bug Fix: Fixed: Shader cashing on Android. To enable shader caching use r.UseShaderCaching=1. Use r.SaveShaderCache command on device to save current cache to file, which then you can include into your game package.

#### Optimizations

* Vulkan pipeline caches will need to be regenerated via the r.Vulkan.SavePipelineCache console command. Previous cache files are no longer compatible.

## PROGRAMMING UPGRADE NOTES

### AI

* Bug Fix: Fixed a bug in GameplayTasks processing that could result in bloating of the UGameplayTasksComponent::KnownTasks array.

### Animation

#### General

* Bug Fix: FindUID no longer returns a pointer, any code calling it will need to be changed

### Audio

* New: To implement the source bus feature, we needed to split out volume attenuation vs distance attenuation. The bus audio needs to be mixed pre-distance-attenuation to avoid getting double-attenuated as the audio is output from the buses. This added some complexity with volume setting/getting in higher level code so if you were retrieving volume of playing sounds for a custom C++ feature, you may want to look at new volume getters and setters. To help with this, we made all volume setting and getting private to wave instances (FWaveInstance).

### Blueprints

* Functions that returned random unit vectors from within cones (whether this required a stream or not) have now been refactored into degree- and radian-based counterparts. The suffix "With yaw and pitch" has also been replaced with "Elliptical" for brevity.

	Where a *single* half-angle used to be required to specify the cone, the new **radian-based** function should be substituted; however, where *both* yaw and pitch were provided, the new **degree-based** function should be used instead. For example:

    * Calls to *RandomUnitVectorInConeFromStream()* should be replaced with **RandomUnitVectorInConeInRadiansFromStream()**.

    * Calls to *RandomUnitVectorInConeWithYawAndPitch()* should be replaced with **RandomUnitVectorInEllipticalConeInDegrees()**.

	From this point onward, the inconsistency in units between the elliptical and non-elliptical functions should be mitigated, as the degree or radian variants can now be used as appropriate.

* *If you have a custom build pipeline that relies on UAT BuildCookRun automation for cooking and/or building, note that in 4.18 it is no longer necessary to specify the -nativizeAssets flag to enable Blueprint nativization.*

    * Instead, UAT now looks at the value of the "BlueprintNativizationMethod" setting in DefaultGame.ini. This can be set by the user in the Editor UI in the Project Settings->Packaging section. If that value does not exist in DefaultGame.ini, then the value is assumed to be "Disabled" (off).

    * You can override the setting by including the following on the UAT command line: "-ini:Game:[/Script/UnrealEd.ProjectPackagingSettings]:BlueprintNativizationMethod=<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>", replacing the "<Disabled|Inclusive|Exclusive>" substring with one of those 3 available options.

    * Similarly, if your build pipeline calls UE4Editor.exe directly (for cooking) and/or UnrealBuildTool.exe directly (for building), the same holds true for those tools as well. You can also override the setting by including the same argument as noted above on each of their command lines, respectively. In that case, you'll need to ensure that both tools are specifying the same nativization method in their command lines.

### Editor

* New: To disable array reordering, use the metadata flag EditFixedOrder on the TArray.

* Developers can now register a delegate with SlateApplication to tell when a window's DPI changes

* The new port is set by default to 17777, which may conflict with projects that have hardcoded their ports when playing in editor.

#### Sequencer

* New: UTexture::GetMaterialType is now const

### Gameplay Framework

* New: As part of the cross-level actor references change, several types and headers were renamed:

    * FStringAssetReference is now FSoftObjectPath

    * FStringClassReference is now FSoftClassPath

    * TAssetPtr is now TSoftObjectPtr

    * TAssetSubclassOf is now TSoftClassPtr

    * StringAssetReference.h/StringClassReference.h is now SoftObjectPath.h

    * AssetPtr.h is now SoftObjectPtr.h

	Including the old headers will give compiler warnings. The old type names are not officially deprecated because many games will have a large number of them, but they should be fixed up as well.

* ComponentToWorld can no longer be directly accessed; use GetComponentTransform() instead.

### Networking

* Messaging: If you use the common helper classes, replace "Messaging" with "MessagingCommon" in your Build.cs files and remove the "Helpers/" subdirectory from your include statements (unless you actually include header files from "Messaging", in which case you need to keep "Messaging" and add "MessagingCommon").

### Online

* IOnlineIdentity::GetPlatformUserIdFromUniqueNetId is now const

#### Android

* This can be enabled via 'Android.EnableSustainedPerformanceMode' Cvar.

#### iOS

* ObjC exceptions default to off, if they are required then set bForceEnableObjCExceptions = true in your ModuleRules.

* To enable add the following line to your IOSRuntimeSettings config:
bDisableForceInline=true

### Rendering

#### Optimizations

* New:

    * *UTexture2D::RequestedMips* was removed and should be replaced by GetNumRequestedMips*()*

    * *UTexture2D::ResidentMips* was removed and should be replaced by *GetNumResidentMips()*

    * *UTexture2D::PendingMipChangeRequestStatus* was removed and streaming status should be handled through *HasPendingUpdate() and IsReadyForStreaming()*

### XR

#### VR

* If you maintain a custom VR plugin that needs to allocate its own render targets, you now need to move the methods out of your IStereoRendering implementation into a IStereoRenderTargetManager implementation. You can reduce the amount of duplicate code by extending FXRRenderTargetManager instead of implementing the interface directly.

* Bug Fix: A receipt based system was added to request an override of the social screen mode to mirroring so that system dialogs are visible on the social screen, or potentially for other reasons. HMDSetupDialog is the only current use of this system.

## DEPRECATIONS

### Core

* Removed unused member variable (FArchiveAsync2::bKeepRestOfFilePrecached)

* Removed FPackageFileSummary's CompressedChunks array as it was no longer being used by anything.

### Physics

* APEX Destuction has been moved to a plugin and is now disabled by default.  To enable the plugin, use the Plugin Manager (Edit > Plugins > Physics). 

### Platforms

#### Mac
* The support code for running the Unreal Engine 4 Editor & Games on Mac OS X 10.11 El Capitan has been removed. The minimum macOS version required for Unreal Engine 4 is no MacOS 10.12.6 Sierra. This was necessary due to the number of Metal features absent from Mac OS X 1.11 that are now required for Unreal Engine 4.

### Rendering

* Deprecating support for the Editor running in Shader Model 4

    * This release we will be deprecating support for running the Editor while using Shader Model 4.  This mainly affects users with only DirectX 10 capable graphics cards.  Starting on the next release we will require a Shader Model 5 (DirectX 11/OpenGL4/Vulkan) capable card.

* Deprecating support for the games running in Shader Model 4 for Open GL

    * This release we will be deprecating support for running the game while using Shader Model 4 on OpenGL for both Windows and Linux.  Starting on the next release we will require a Shader Model 5 (OpenGL4) capable card.

#### Mobile Rendering

* The Android OpenGL ES deferred renderer has been removed.

### Tools

* CrashReporter has been removed from the public UnrealEngine distribution until it can be adapted to a more scalable solution that is usable by subscribers and licensees.

#### UnrealBuildTool

* Deprecated the BuildConfiguration and UEBuildConfiguration aliases from the ModuleRules class. These have been implemented as an alias ot the ReadOnlyTargetRules instance passed to the constructor for several engine versions.
