![image alt text](image_0.jpg)(w:930 h:269 convert:false)

# What's New

Unreal Engine 4.20 delivers on our promises to give developers the scalable tools they need to succeed. Create a future-focused mobile game, explore the impact of Niagara, breathe life into compelling, believable digital humans, and take advantage of workflow optimizations on all platforms.

You can now **build life-like digital characters and believable worlds** with unparalleled realism. Take your visual effects to the next level with Unreal Engine's new Niagara particle editor to add amazing  detail to all aspects of your project. Use the new Digital Humans technology powering the "Meet Mike" and "Siren" demos to raise the bar on realism. With the new Cinematic Depth of Field, you can achieve cinema quality camera effects in real-time.

Unreal Engine empowers you to **make things your way** by giving you the tools to customize the creation process to your preferred style and workflow. With the new Editor Scripting and Automation Libraries, you can can create completely customized tools and workflows. Make the lives of designers and artists easier by adding new actions to apply to Actors or assets thanks to scripted extensions for Actor and Content Browser context menus.

Battle-tested mobile and console support means you can **create once and play on any device** to deliver experiences anywhere users want to enjoy them. Epic has rallied around the mobile release of Fortnite to optimize Unreal Engine for mobile game development. We have made tons of performance improvements including implementing both hardware and software occlusion queries to limit the amount of work the hardware needs to do. Proxy LOD is now production-ready and can further reduce the complexity of the geometry that needs to be rendered at any time.

In addition to all of the updates from Epic, this release includes **165 improvements submitted by the incredible community of Unreal Engine developers on GitHub**! Thanks to each of these contributors to Unreal Engine 4.20:

# Major Features

## New: Optimizations and Improvements for Shipping on Mobile Platforms

**Unreal Engine 4.20 brings well over 100 mobile optimizations developed for Fortnite on iOS and Android**, marking a major shift for developers in terms of ability to more easily ship games and seamlessly optimize gameplay across platforms. Major enhancements include improved Android debugging, mobile landscape improvements, and occlusion queries on mobile.

![image alt text](image_9.jpg)(w:669 convert:false)

**Hardware and Software Occlusion Queries on Mobile**

Hardware Occlusion Queries are now supported for high-end mobile devices on iOS and Android that support ES 3.1 or Vulkan using the GPU. They are enabled by default for any device that supports them.

Software Occlusion Queries is an experimental feature that uses the CPU to cull primitive components from the scene. Because it uses a conservative approach, it can be used on any mobile device. 

![image alt text](image_10.png)(w:437 convert:false) ![image alt text](image_11.png)(w:438 convert:false)

*Left - r.Mobile.AllowSoftwareOcclusion 1, r.SO.VisualizeBuffer 1; Right - Render frozen showing occluded parts*

To enable Software Occlusion Queries, follow these steps:

1. Enable r.Mobile.AllowSoftwareOcclusion 1.

2. Disable r.AllowOcclusionQueries 0.

3. Enable any primitive to be an occluder by setting **LOD for Occluder Mesh** true in the Static Mesh Editor. 

You can visualize the results in the [Mobile Previewer](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Platforms/Mobile/Previewer) when using **High-End Mobile** and then enable r.SO.VisualizeBuffer 1. 

**Platform Material Stats**

**Quickly profile and optimize your Materials** using the new Platform Stats window inside of the Material Editor! You can now see stats for multiple shader platforms and quality levels. For mobile platforms, we use an offline shader compiler to give more accurate instruction and Texture usage information.

![image alt text](image_12.png)(w:930 convert:false)

**Improved Android Debugging**

**Iterate and debug on Android without having to repackage the UE4 project!** When compiling Android, we now generate a Gradle project file which can be opened in Android Studio. You can place breakpoints in C++ and Java code and use Android Studio to launch a debug session.  You can also make changes to C++ source code and recompile. If you start a new debug session, Android Studio will notice the change and quickly upload the new shared library to your device.

**Mobile Landscape Improvements**

Make your terrains on mobile more interesting now that you can have **unlimited Landscape Material layers on mobile devices**! While three is still the best optimized case, any number of Landscape layers are supported, provided there are sufficient Texture Samplers available. 

You can now use the Feature Level Switch Material nodes in Landscape Materials enabling you to **create a single Landscape Material for all platforms**.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_13.gif)(w:653 convert:false)
[/REGION]

*1 - Mobile Landscape; 2 - PC Landscape*

**Miscellaneous Mobile Improvements**

* Minimum Static Mesh LOD per platform

* Minimum Skeletal Mesh LOD per platform

* Hardware occlusion improvements

* HLOD tools and workflow optimizations

* Audio quality node

* Audio variation culling

* Audio downsampling  per platform

* No memory cost for unused LODs, including:

    * Static Meshes

    * Skeletal Meshes

    * Material quality levels

    * Grass and foliage

    * High detail components and meshes

    * High detail emitters in Cascade

* Settings based on device memory

* Material memory reduction

* Editor scriptability for bulk asset changes

* Particle component pooling

* Material parameter collection update cost

## New: Optimizations and Improvements for Shipping on Nintendo Switch

We have significantly improved Nintendo Switch development by releasing **tons of performance and memory improvements built for Fortnite on Nintendo Switch to all Unreal Engine developers**!

![image alt text](image_14.jpg)(w:930 convert:false)

This includes the following:

* Support for Dynamic Resolution and Temporal Upsampling

* Low Latency Frame Syncing for Controller Input

* Significant CPU Rendering Optimizations

* Improvements to Threading

* Better Texture Compression

* Support for Memory Profiling

* Backbuffer support for 1080p while in docked mode

* And many other fixes!

## New: Proxy LOD Improvements

The new **Proxy LOD tool** has graduated from "**Experimental**" to **production-ready**! This tool provides performance advantages by reducing rendering cost due to poly count, draw calls, and material complexity which results in **significant gains when developing for mobile and console platforms**. This tool provides an alternative to the third-party package Simplygon and can be used in conjunction with the **Level of Detail (LOD)** systems in Unreal Engine.

The Proxy LOD tool produces a simpler representation by creating a proxy in the form of a single low-poly parameterized mesh and associated textures that visually approximate a collection of more complex source geometry models. This proxy can then be displayed at runtime when a reduction in model quality is acceptable - for example, when geometry only occupies a small number of pixels on screen.

**Note:** The Proxy LOD tool is currently only available in Unreal Editor on Windows.

![image alt text](image_15.jpg)(w:930 convert:false)

_The above image shows the buildings and parking lots in **Fortnite Battle Royale** constructed using the **Proxy LOD tool** where both **Gap-Filling** and **Hard-Edge Splitting** were in use._

The production-ready version of the Proxy LOD tool has several enhancements over the Experimental version found in 4.19. Particularly, improved user control over the Normals on the Proxy Geometry and the ability to generate much simpler proxies by using  gap-filling to automatically close doors and windows.

**Improved Normal Control : Hard Edge Split Normal**

The extreme constraints on Fortnite memory usage call for highly efficient uses of LODs. For most proxies, very small base color textures are generated and no Normal map is used, this approach requires the highest possible quality Normals on the proxy mesh itself.  

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_16.gif)(w:581 convert:false)
[/REGION]

*1 - Hard Edge Angle = 80;2 - Hard Edge Angle = 0*

The above gif shows the effect of hard-edge splitting for vertex normals. The image 2 shows smooth vertex normals, as calculated in the 4.19 Experimental version of the Plugin -  the dark regions near the bottom of the house are indicative of the shortcomings. Compare this with image 1 which shows hard-edge vertex normal splitting with a user-supplied hard-edge cutoff angle.

In addition to the hard-edge cutoff angle, the user may now specify the method used in computing the vertex normal, by selecting between **_Angle Weighted_**, **_Area Weighted_**, and **_Equal Weighted_**.

**Gap Filling**

For watertight geometry, the Proxy system automatically discards any inaccessible structures (for example, interior walls or furniture within a closed house). For ideal results, source geometry should be constructed or altered with this in mind, but due to game production constraints that isn't always feasible. To facilitate the generation of efficient Proxy LODs from source geometry that is *nearly watertight*, the Proxy LOD tool can optionally use the level set-based techniques of dilation and erosion, to close gaps. The intended use case is primarily doors and windows in distant buildings.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_17.gif)(w:469 convert:false)
[/REGION]

*1 - Original Mesh; 2 - No Gap Filling; 3 - Gap Filling*

The above gif shows the effect of using Gap Filling. All images were constrained to use a fixed small amount of texture space. Image 2 is the result of Proxy LOD on a building without using Gap Filling, in which case the LOD includes the interior of the building (at the cost of unseen triangles and texels). Image 3 is the same building with Gap Filling used to automatically close the doors and windows of the buildings, resulting in fewer total triangles and a better use of the limited texture resource.

## New: Cinematic Depth of Field

The new **Cinematic Depth of Field (DoF)** enables you to achieve your vision of rendering **cinema quality scenes in a real-time environment**! This new method is designed as a higher-quality replacement for the Circle DoF method and is faster than most other DoF methods, such as Bokeh. With Cinematic DoF, the depth of field effect is cleaner, providing a cinematic appearance with the use of a procedural Bokeh simulation. This new DoF implementation also supports alpha channel, dynamic resolution stability, and includes settings to scale it down for console projects. 

![image alt text](image_1.png)(w:930 convert:false)

![image alt text](image_2.png)(w:460 convert:false) ![image alt text](image_3.png)(w:461 convert:false)

*Left - Cinematic Depth of Field enabled; Right - Depth of Field disabled*

Cinematic Depth of Field is enabled by default and replaces the current selection for the **Circle DoF** method in the **Camera** and **Post Process** settings.

 

* Cinematic DoF supports the following Platforms: 

    * D3D11 SM5, D3D12 SM5, Vulkan SM5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Mac.

* The procedural Bokeh simulation supports the following features:

    * Configuring the number of blades for the Diaphragm.

    * Configuring the curvature of the blades directly with the Lens' largest aperture (Minimal F-stop).

    * Configurable controls available in the **Camera** settings of the Post Process Volume, Camera Actor, and Cine Camera Actor.

* Many customizable scalability settings using r.DOF.* console variables to scale it according to your project needs on hardware with finite resources.

For additional information, please see the [Depth of Field](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Rendering/PostProcessEffects/DepthOfField/CinematicDOFMethodsDOFMethods) documentation.

## New: Niagara Visual Effects Editor (Early Access)

The **Niagara Visual Effects (VFX) Editor** is now available as an **Early Access** Plugin! Try out an early access version of the all-new visual effects tool that will eventually replace Unreal Cascade. [Watch this GDC talk](https://youtu.be/mNPYdfRVPtM) for a deeper dive on the vision for Niagara.

**Note:** The early access nature of this feature means that we are far enough along in development that we want to share it with our customers and get as much feedback as possible before it becomes a standard UE4 Feature. Early Access **does not** mean that Niagara is production ready as we still have quite a bit of performance optimization and bug fixing that needs to be done before you can consider using this tool for production. However, we hope that effects developers begin investing in learning Niagara and work with us to make it the best VFX editor that it can be.

**Improvements to Effect Design and Creation**

![image alt text](image_5.png)(w:930 convert:false)

*Left - Particle system utilizing dynamic input module; Right - Dynamic input module*

* **Skeletal Meshes** can specify their emission from the surface, being driven by either Material name or a named bone influence region.

* Specifying default values in Modules has been improved, allowing a wide variety of behaviors from calling functions to using default dynamic inputs.

* Mesh particles now support Angular Velocity.

* Beams support has been added to the Ribbon renderer with new corresponding Modules.

* Dependencies between Modules can now be defined, enabling the user to be informed when they are putting the stack in a bad configuration. Also, users are being given options to **auto-fix**.

* Multiple improvements have been made to merging System Emitters and Base Emitters, enhancing overall stability.

* Modules can now be moved up and down the stack via drag-and-drop. Inherited Modules cannot be moved because doing so complicates merging.

* Modules can now be enabled/disabled within the stack. This will also work for inheritance.

* **Sequencer **and **Blueprint **support for setting Niagara User Namespace variables has been added.

* You can drive parameters by custom **HLSL Expressions**, **Dynamic Inputs (graph snippets)**, links to other **variables**, or **by** **value**.

* Optionally, particles can now have a **Persistent ID,** which is guaranteed to be unique for that emitter.

* Multiple renderers of each type can be applied to an emitter. Each instance can adjust where it gets the values for a given parameter. For example, an emitter could have two sprite renderers, one pulling its position from a particle's position and the other pulling its position from a particle's offset position.

* The **Niagara Extras** **Plugin** also contains a debug Material that routes various per-particle parameters to a dialog-like display.

* Houdini has provided a simple CSV importer to Niagara, enabling demo content for GDC 2018.

* A wide variety of functionality for Niagara has been added under the **Automated Testing** system.

**Updated User Interface**

The Niagara interface has been designed to be make complex effects intuitive to create. It uses a stack metaphor as its primary method of combining pieces of script logic together. Inside of the stack, you will find a **Timeline** to control aspects of the effect over time**, **a **Parameters Panel** for easy access to variables available in the effect**, **and a** **Attribute Spreadsheet** to quickly find and react to information as the effect is running.

![image alt text](image_6.png)(w:928 convert:false)

**New Modules**

All of Niagara's Modules have been updated or rewritten to support commonly used behaviors in building effects for games and adhere to a consistent set of coding standards. New UI features have also been added for the Niagara stack that mimic the options developers have with UProperties in C++, enabling inline enable/disable or variable display based on the state of another variable.

**GPU Simulation**

Niagara now has support for **GPU **Simulation when used on **DX11**,** PS4**, **Xbox One**, **OpenGL (ES3.1)**, and **Metal** platforms. There are plans  for **Vulkan**and **Switch**to support GPU Simulation in a future release. Current limitations and known issues with GPU simulation are described below:

* Full support for Niagara requires the ability to read-back data from the GPU. Currently only our **DX11 **and **PS4** rendering interfaces support this functionality, and **OpenGL **and **Metal **are in progress.

* **Collision**, **Curves**, and **Curl Noise Fields** are supported on the GPU. **Meshes**, **Skinned Meshes**, **Spline Components**, and more specialized data interfaces are not yet supported. The API for GPU shaders to interact with **UNiagaraDataInterfaces **has been redesigned as well.

* **Sprite **and **Instanced Static Mesh **rendering from particles is supported on GPU simulations. At this time, **Light Generation** from Particles and Ribbons from Particles do not work on the GPU.

* Events only work on the CPU and will be undergoing significant changes after Unreal Engine 4.20.

**CPU Simulation & Compilation**

Niagara **CPU **Simulation now works on **PC, PS4, Xbox One, OpenGL (ES3.1)** and **Metal**. At this time, **Vulkan **and **Switch **are **not **supported. 

* The CPU virtual machine (VM) now compiles its contents to the DDC on a background thread, significantly improving overall compilation speed and team efficiency. Further work is required to make the final and expensive VM optimization step occur in ShaderCompileWorker because it depends on non-thread safe libraries. Compilation dependencies are properly tracked across Modules, clearly identifying when we need to recompile certain parts of the stack.

* Physics simulation on the CPU should properly model the **Physics Material** values for friction and restitution (bounciness).

* Emitters will now simulate in parallel on worker threads.

## New: Digital Human Improvements

As part of Epic's character explorations to develop Digital Humans that started with the [Photorealistic Character](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Resources/Showcases/PhotorealisticCharacter) bust, many rendering improvements have been made to develop realistic believable characters that come to life. 

![image alt text](image_7.jpg)(w:928 convert:false)

While developing these characters, the following rendering improvements have been made for Skin, Eyes, Lighting, and Subsurface Scattering.

* Added a new Specular model with the Double Beckman Dual Lobe method.

* Light Transmission using Backscatter for Subsurface Profiles.

* Better contact shadowing for Subsurface Scattering with Boundary Bleed Color.

* Short Distance Dynamic Global Illumination through Post Process Materials.

* Added detail for eyes using a separate normal map for the Iris.

For additional information, see [Digital Humans](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Resources/Showcases/DigitalHumans). 

## New: Rectangular Area Lights

Rectangular Area Lights enable you to make more realistic lighting for environments containing large light sources, such as fluorescent overhead lights, televisions, lit signs, and more! Rectangular Area Lights are accessible from the Modes panel along with the other light types. 

![image alt text](image_8.jpg)(w:925 convert:false)

* Currently only supports the Deferred Renderer. 

* Acts mostly like a Point Light, except it has Source Width and Height to control the area emitting light. 

* Static and Stationary mobility shadowing works like an area light source with Moveable dynamic shadowing, currently working more like a point light with no area.

Performance Considerations:

* More expensive overall than Point or Spot Lights with the dominant cost being incurred when movable and casting shadows. Shadowing generally has the same cost. 

* Stationary Light mobility or Non-Shadow Casting lights can be double the cost with cost scaling depending on the platform being used. If you're using Static Lights, the cost is free. 

## New: Mixed Reality Capture (Early Access)

**Create compelling spectating experiences for mixed reality applications** using the new Mixed Reality Capture functionality, which makes it easy to **composite real players into a virtual play space**!

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_18.gif)(w:725 convert:false)
[/REGION]

The early access Mixed Reality Capture support has three components: video input, calibration, and in-game compositing.  We have a list of supported webcams and HDMI capture devices that enable you to pull real world green screened video into the Unreal Engine from a variety of sources.  If you have a Vive Tracker or similar tracking device, Mixed Reality Capture can match your camera location to the in-game camera to make shots more dynamic and interesting. Setup and calibration is done through a standalone calibration tool that can be reused across Unreal Engine 4 titles. Once you set up your filming location, you can use it across all applications.

While feature support is in early access, we're looking forward to getting feedback as we continue to improve the system. More information about Mixed Reality Capture setup can be found in the Mixed Reality Development [documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Platforms/MR).

## New: nDisplay Flexible, Multi-Display Rendering

Effortlessly **create video walls for large visualization installations** using the new **nDisplay** system! Automatically launch any number of Unreal Engine instances -  locked firmly together, with deterministic content and frame-accurate time synchronization - across any number of host computers, each instance driving its own projector or monitor display. Use active or passive stereoscopic rendering to enhance the viewer's sense of immersion in the 3D scene and built-in VRPN support to drive the system from mobile VR controllers.

![image alt text](image_19.jpg)(w:930 convert:false)

For more information, please see the [documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Rendering/Rendering-to-Multiple-Displays-with-nDisplay).

## New: Submix Audio Recording

In the new audio engine, we've added the ability to record Engine output - or any individual Submix's output - to a *.wav file or SoundWave Asset.

![image alt text](image_20.png)(w:724 convert:false)

*Exporting Submix output to a SoundWave Asset.*

![image alt text](image_21.png)(w:728 convert:false)

*Exporting Submix output to a *.wav file.*

## New: Shared Skeletal Mesh LOD Setting 

**Set LOD settings once and reuse them across multiple Skeletal Mesh assets** using the new LOD Settings asset! Inside the Asset Details panel for a Skeletal Mesh, under LOD Settings, you can now select an LOD Settings asset to use, or you can generate a new asset based on the current settings.

Please see the [Sharing LOD Settings](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Animation/Persona/MeshDetails#sharinglodsettings) section of the Skeletal Mesh Asset Details page for more information. 

You can also assign the LOD setting and regenerate LODs from Blueprint using a Blutility.

## New: Streaming GeomCache and Improved Alembic importer (Experimental)

We continue to make stability and performance improvements to the geometry cache system, as noted in the following: 

* Individual vertex animation frames are now compressed using an intra-frame codec based on Huffman encoding. Compressed data is streamed from disk, enabling playback of longer sequence with a low amount of memory overhead. *The new implementation is still very experimental and is not ready for use in production*

* The Alembic importer has been changed to iteratively import frames rather than importing all frames in bulk. This should improve the PCA pipeline and overall stability and speed.

## New: Scripted Extensions for Actor and Content Browser Context Menu

**Easily create in-context tools and workflow enhancements without writing a line of code** by extending the context menus for Actors and Content Assets in the Browser using Blueprint Utilities, or Blutilities. 

* Create a new Blutility using one of the new parent classes - AssetActionUtility (for Content Browser extensions) or ActorActionUtility (for Actor extensions).

* You can specify what types of Actors or Assets the actions apply to with the GetSupportedClass function.

* Add logic in events (or functions) with no return value, marking them as "Call In Editor" so they show up in the context menu, and a pop-up dialog will display when the event is triggered to fill in values for any parameters you define on your events

## New: Animation Retarget Manager Improvements

Animation Retarget Manager now supports saving and loading of the mapping data, so you can **save and reuse mapping data on multiple meshes**. You can also quickly save multiple rig data for different animations and reuse them with this feature.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_23.gif)(w:678 convert:false)
[/REGION]

Please see the [Retarget Manager](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Animation/Persona/BasePoseManager#setuprig) page for more information. 

## New: RigidBody Anim Node Improvements

You can now have movement on simulated bodies when moving the Skeletal Mesh Component around in the world when using 'Local Space' simulation, which offers greater stability for your simulation. We have now added some options to look at the linear velocity and acceleration of the component in world space, and apply them (scaled and clamped) to the local space simulation.

We also added the option for any joint to be the base of simulation, and added support for dynamics to easily be reset.

**Note**:These are not supported for collisions in rigid body simulations.

You can also now copy Skeletal Mesh vertex colors to any selected Clothing Parameter Mask. 

## New: Garbage Collection Improvements

Garbage collection performance has been optimized **reducing some operations by as much as 13x**! Specifically, we made the following improvements:

* The "Mark" phase has been optimized and is now multithreaded. On machines with multiple cores, the cost of marking Objects as unreachable has been **reduced from 8 ms to 0.6 ms for approximately 500,000 Objects**.

* The "BeginDestroy" phase (unhashing Objects) now runs across multiple frames, using **no more than 2 ms per frame**. The cost of unhashing Objects will no longer be included in the same frame as the "Mark" phase and reachability analysis.

* Garbage Collection assumption verification, which runs in development builds, now uses the same multithreaded code as reference-gathering. As a result, development builds will see an improvement in Garbage Collection times. In Epic's tests, sample timings for about 500,000 Objects **reduced from over 320 ms to under 80 ms**.

## New: Visual Studio 2017

UE4 now uses the Visual Studio 2017 compiler, and the Engine will generate project files for Visual Studio 2017 by default. Visual Studio 2015 is still being supported, but requires some configuration. Additionally, we've added support for the Windows 10 SDK.

**Note:** Visual Studio 2017 supports the installation of multiple compiler versions side-by-side.

See our [Hardware & Software Specifications](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/GettingStarted/RecommendedSpecifications) for more information.

## New: Development Streams on GitHub

Unreal Engine development streams are now updated live on [GitHub](https://github.com/EpicGames/UnrealEngine). If you want the latest version of development code, you can now pull these streams directly, without waiting for Epic to merge changes from the development teams into our main branch. Note that these streams are live, and have not been vetted by our QA team, which is typically the case in our binary releases or in the main branch.

## New: UMG Safe Zone Improvements

The Screen Sizes you select in UMG and Play-In-Editor (PIE) settings are now linked with Device Profiles, which also takes into account the Mobile Content Scale Factor, meaning that the final resolution and DPI scale will change based on the device screen size selected. 

![image alt text](image_26.png)(w:925 convert:false)

![image alt text](image_27.png)(w:452 convert:false)   ![image alt text](image_28.png)(w:452 convert:false)

The following improvements have been made for UMG Safe Zone workflow: 

* Safe Zone previewing is now automatically enabled for Debug Title Safe Zone when using a value less than 1 to test screen sizes for TVs and Monitors.

* Using the command r.MobileContentScaleFactor works to scale phone and tablet resolutions in UMG previews and PIE modes.

* Non-Uniform safe zones are now supported for devices like the iPhoneX, where parts of the screen are inaccessible.

* Safe Zones, Scale Boxes, and Common Border Widgets react correctly to non-uniform safe zones and UMG Designer sizes. 

* UMG now displays the selected device, its screen size, and uniform scaling factor for easy reference in the Designer Graph.

* Use r.MobileContentScaleFactor to scale phone and tablet resolutions in UMG and PIE modes.

For additional information, see [UMG Safe Zones](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/UMG/UserGuide/UMGSafeZones).

##NEW: UMG Rich Text Block Widget

UMG now supports Rich Text styling and inline images through the new Rich Text Block Widget. Unlike the Rich Text widget, the Rich Text Block supports markup for things like styling, inline images, hyperlinks, and much more! It also enables you to specify your own Decorators that you can use to define the markup behavior you need for your project.

![](UMGRichTextBlock.png)

To get started, simply add a **Rich Text Block Widget** to your Canvas panel in UMG and create a Data Table Asset to store all your text styles and images that can be called through markup. When creating a **Data Table Asset**, choose either the **Rich Image Row** or **Rich Text Style Row** where you’ll add images or text stylings that can be referenced by the Rich Text Block.

## New: Curve Atlases in Materials

Materials can now use a Curve Atlas asset to store and access linear color curve data with additional support provided through Blueprint. The Curve Atlas uses the same linear curve color as before, except you can use as many linear color curves as the size of your specified Atlas.

To create a new Curve Atlas, use the Content Browser to select **Add New > Miscellaneous** and select **Curve Atlas**.

When you open a Curve Asset Editor, you'll be able to adjust the Hue, Saturation, Brightness, Vibrance, and Alpha clamps of any individual curve. Additionally, the Preview thumbnails in the Content Browser will display the gradient set by the curve.

For additional information, see [Curve Atlases in Materials](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Rendering/Materials/CurveAtlasesInMaterials). 

## New: Mesh Description Mesh Format

UE4 is moving to a new higher-level intermediate format which can represent any type of mesh asset in the Engine. This is a gradual process that will improve workflow and enable us to provide some great new features. 

The goal of moving to a new mesh format is:

* All meshes (Static, Skeletal, and potential other mesh-like objects such as terrain and BSP) can have the same internal representation with some interchangeability, to a certain degree. 

* Most UE4 geometry tools will work on any type of mesh based on the geometry format.

* Any mesh using the new format can be examined and modified using a standard API enabling runtime, native or scripted modification, opening up many possibilities for procedurally generated content.

* Meshes will be imported directly to the format with the ability to preserve higher-level mesh representations, such as quads or edge hardness. Currently, these are lost when importing a Static or Skeletal Mesh.

* The new mesh format is structured internally so that modifications can be made in real-time, even to the most complicated meshes. This forms the basis of a work-in-progress mesh editing feature, which is also scriptable, that will be developed for a future release.


In this release, only Static Mesh has been converted to use the new mesh format. Users will not notice any difference to their everyday workflow and the assets themselves will not change. Currently, the new data is automatically created from the old format and cached in the DDC.

## New: Label Saved Colors in Color Picker

Colors saved in your Theme Bar or Theme Menu can now have labels for identification purposes! Labels can easily be set by right-clicking the saved color swatch and entering a name for the saved color.

## New: Recently Opened Filter in Content Browser

Quickly find recently viewed Assets in the Content Browser using the new **Recently Opened** filter! This filter lists the 20 most recently opened assets. 

![image alt text](image_31.png)(w:926 convert:false)

You can find the Recently Opened filter in the **Filters** list under **Other Filters**. You can change the number of recently opened assets listed in **Editor Preferences > Content Browser** with **Number of Assets to Keep in the Recently Opened Filter**. 

For additional information, see [Content Browser Filter](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Browser/UserGuide/Filters)[s](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-US/Engine/Content/Browser/UserGuide/Filters).

## New: Shotgun Integration (Early Access)

Streamline your production pipeline using the new Shotgun integration for Unreal Engine 4!

![image alt text](image_32.png)(w:930 convert:false)

Features include: 

* It adds the Unreal Editor to your Shotgun launcher, so artists can reliably open the right version of Unreal for the Shotgun project.

* You can open the Shotgun panel in the Unreal Editor interface, so you can stay up to date with the activity in the Shotgun project as you work.

* It hooks into the Shotgun loader, so you can easily bring assets into your Unreal Project, and control where they end up in your Content Browser.

* It even adds Shotgun interaction commands to the contextual menus you get when you right-click Actors in a Level, or assets in the Content Browser.

**Note:** We're working out the last details before we can share our integration on GitHub. Check back soon for updates and documentation!
<!-- Note: Hiding this link until approval from legal. Ping Robb S. for info -->
<!--For details, please see the [Shotgun Integration](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Editor/Content/Using-Unreal-Engine-with-Autodesk-Shotgun)[ documentation](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Editor/Content/Using-Unreal-Engine-with-Autodesk-Shotgun).-->

## New: Editor Scripting and Automation Libraries

The **Editor Scripting Utilities** **Plugin** is now available to all Unreal Engine users. This Plugin offers simplified interfaces for scripting and automating the Unreal Editor, working with assets in the Content Browser, working with Actors in the current Level, editing the properties of Static Mesh assets, and more.

For details, see [Scripting and Automating the Editor](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Editor/Scripting-and-Automating-the-Editor).

## New: Import Asset Metadata through FBX

When you import an FBX file into Unreal, any FbxProperty data that is saved in that file is now imported as well. You can access this metadata in Blueprint or Python scripts that you run in the Unreal Editor. This can help you customize your own asset management pipelines for Unreal based on information about your assets that comes from your content creation tools.

For details, see [FBX Asset Metadata Pipeline](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Editor/Content/FBX/FBX-Asset-Metadata-Pipeline).

## New: Improved Script Access to Static Meshes for LODs and Collisions

Blueprint and Python scripts that you run in the Unreal Editor can now modify more properties of your Static Mesh assets. This allows you to automate some of the tools offered by the user interface of the Static Mesh Editor. For example:

* You can now auto-generate Levels of Detail (LODs) for your geometry, which increases the rendering performance of your scene by using progressively less detailed versions of your geometry as the distance from the camera viewpoint to the geometry increases. See [Creating Levels of Detail in Blueprints and Python](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Editor/Content/FBX/FBX-Asset-Metadata-Pipeline).

* You can now auto-generate collision meshes that represent your Static Mesh assets in the physics simulation. See [Setting up Collisions with Static Meshes in Blueprints and Python](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Editor/Scripting-and-Automating-the-Editor/Editor-Scripting-How-Tos/Setting-up-Collision-Properties-in-Blueprints-and-Python).

## New: Blueprint Bookmarks

The Blueprint Bookmarks feature provides the ability to create named Bookmarks in any function graph in the Blueprint Editor. Bookmarks being created will be listed in a new UI window, where you can click them to restore the position and zoom level of the Viewport (as well as the active tab you were viewing). In addition to the Bookmarks you create, you can also quickly jump to any Comment node in your Blueprint by selecting the comment from a separate list. Bookmarks are stored locally on your machine, so they won't affect the Blueprints themselves, and syncing content will not overwrite your Bookmarks with those of another user.

## New: Blueprint Watch Window

The **Blueprint Watch Window** is designed to speed up debugging by giving you access to the variables and nodes that you want to watch, even across multiple Blueprints. Watch data from every Blueprint that you open in the Editor, and that is part of the current call stack, will be consolidated into a single list, enabling you to inspect variables and function outputs. Also, you can jump between Blueprints with ease. You can click on an entry in the "Node Name" column to go to the named node in any Blueprint, while selecting entries in the "Object Name" column will select the instance of the object associated with that entry. Arrays, Sets, Maps, and other data structures can be expanded, making a drill-down examination of any data they contain quick and convenient.

## New: Improved Mobile Specular Lighting Model

**Mobile** **specular response** has been changed to use the **GGX Lighting Model** by default. This improves mobile specular quality and better matches **SM5** but adds a small cost to shader processing time. 

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_34.gif)(w:800 convert:false)
[/REGION]

*1 - 4.20 Default GGX Specular; 2 - 4.19 Spherical Gaussian Specular*

The previous **Spherical Gaussian Specular** model is still accessible via the **'Use legacy shading mode'** project option and can be found under **Rendering** > **Mobile**.  

## New: Mobile Skylight Reflections

The Mobile Renderer now uses a **Skylight Cubemap** for **Specular Reflections** when no **Reflection Captures** are relevant. 

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_35.gif)(w:485 convert:false)
[/REGION]

1 - Mobile, no reflection captures ; 2 - PC, no reflection captures

## New: Replication Driver / Replication Graph

The Replication Graph Plugin provides a replication system optimized for games with large Actor and player counts. The system works by building a series of customized nodes that can centralize data and computation. These nodes persist across multiple frames and can be shared by client connections, cutting down on redundant CPU work and enabling Actors to be grouped together in nodes based on game-specific update rules. We may make changes to the API, so this is considered Experimental in 4.20, but it is in use in Fortnite Battle Royale and it will be a fully supported feature.

## New: Steam Authentication

Steam Authentication has been added! Games can now add a packet handler component that interfaces with Steam's authentication APIs, enabling them to advertise their servers properly, handle VAC/publisher bans, and provide better validation of clients. If enabled, clients joining a server now have to be authenticated by Steam before being allowed into gameplay. By default, clients who fail authentication are kicked from the server.


## Virtual Camera Plugin

New to 4.20, the Virtual Camera Plugin enables a user to drive a Cine Camera in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) using an iPad Pro in a virtual production environment. With ARKit, a Vive Tracker, or an optical motion capture system such as Vicon or Optitrack, the position and rotation of the iPad is broadcast wirelessly to the PC, with the PC sending video back to the iPad.

Camera settings such as focal length, aperture, focus distance, and stabilization can be adjusted using touch input. Additionally, the virtual camera can be used for taking high-res screenshots, setting waypoints, recording camera motion and other tasks related to virtual production.

On the Learn tab of the Epic Games Launcher under the **Engine Feature Samples** section, there is a **Virtual Camera** project which includes a sample scene and project set up for use with the Virtual Camera Plugin.

For more information, please see the [Virtual Camera Plugin](Engine/Plugins/VirtualCameraPlugin) documentation

## New: Frame Accuracy Improvements for Sequencer

Sequencer now stores all internal time data as integers, enabling robust support of frame-accuracy in situations where it is a necessity. Keys, section bounds, and other data are now always locked to the underlying user-controllable sequence resolution; this can be as fine or as coarse as the use-case demands. Very high resolutions will support greater fidelity of key placement and sub-frames, while reducing overall sequence range.

![image alt text](image_36.jpg)(w:922 convert:false)

Key Updates: 

* The time cursor in Sequencer is now represented as a block that spans the full range of the currently evaluated Tick, showing very clearly which keys are evaluated and which are not for any given frame.

* "Force Fixed Frame Interval" playback has been rebranded as "Frame Locked", setting the Engine max FPS to the Sequence's display rate, and locking time to whole frame numbers (no sub-frame interpolation)

* Sub frame evaluation remains fully supported for situations where frame accuracy is not a consideration (such as UMG animation).

* Various time sources are now supported for runtime evaluation such as the Engine clock (supporting world-pause), audio clock and platform clock.

* The UI can now be viewed in Non Drop Frame (NDF) Timecode and Drop Frame (DF) Timecode. NDF Timecode is available to all frame rates and directly converts the frame number to hours, minutes, seconds, and remaining frames. DF Timecode is only supported on NTSC Rates (23.976, 29.97, 59.94). The display format can be changed with the Ctrl + T keyboard combination or with the framerate UI menu.

Please see the new [Sequencer Time Refactor Notes](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Sequencer/Workflow/SequencerTimeRefactorNotes) page for more information. 

## New: Media Track for Sequencer

Sequencer has a new track for playing media sources. It is like the audio track, but for movies. Simply drag-and-drop a **Media Source** asset into the track view or create a **Media Track** from the **Add Track** menu. This feature currently works best with Image Sequences, especially EXR. Image Sequences in the Media Track will accurately sync frames with rendered output.

![image alt text](image_37.png)(w:585 convert:false)

Please see the [Using Media Tracks](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/Using-Media-Tracks) page for more information. 

## New: Sequencer Curve Editor and Evaluation Enhancements

Several enhancements have been made to the **Curve Editor** and **Evaluation** in Sequencer including:

Weighted tangents are now supported on float curves.

[REGION:asyncgif]
![image alt text](image_38.gif)(w:925 convert:false)
[/REGION]

*Using weighted curves in the sequencer curve editor*

Added support for continuous Euler Angle changes when changing rotations. Euler angles are no longer limited to -180,180, which is necessary to avoid flips in animation.

You can now turn on Quaternion Rotation on a 3D Transform Section via the track's Properties menu to utilize quaternion interpolation to smoothly interpolate between two rotations. This is similar to the feature previously available in Matinee.

## New: Animating Variables on Anim Instances in Sequencer

It is now possible to animate variables on **Anim Instances** through possessables, enabling direct control of Anim Blueprint variables, functions and other content. To add an Anim Instance binding to Sequencer, look for its name in the  [+Track] button for Skeletal Animation Components. Any variables that are exposed to cinematics will be shown on its track picker.

## New: Final Cut Pro 7 XML Import/Export in Sequencer

Sequencer movie scene data can now be exported to and imported from the Final Cut Pro 7 XML format. This can be use to roundtrip data to Adobe Premiere Pro and other editing software that supports FCP 7 XML. You can trim and offset shots in editing software and map those back to sequencer automatically during import.

**Note:** Audio is not supported at this time.

## New: Sequence Recorder Improvements

**Sequence Recorder** now supports a profile system that is stored in the Persistent Level. Recording profiles enable you to store which actors you wish to record and their settings, as well as the output path to store the recorded data in. Sequence Recorder also now supports recording multiple takes for each of the selected actors.

Please see the [Sequence Recorder](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Sequencer/Workflow/SequenceRecorder) page for more information. 

## New: Sequencer Track Usability Improvements

Several updates have been made to improve the usability of **Tracks** within Sequencer. Tracks, Actors and Folders can now be reordered, Event Track names are displayed next to the event keyframe, you can now resize sections to their source duration, you can mask individual transform channels, create Pose Assets from the blended pose and more. 

Please see the new [Working with Tracks in Sequencer](https://docs.unrealengine.com/en-us/Engine/Sequencer/HowTo/WorkingWithTracks) page for more information. 

## New: Translucency Support for Instanced Stereo Rendering

We've taken the improvements to the Instance Stereo Rendering (ISR) path that we made for Robo Recall, and improved them to work across more features in the engine. Unreal Engine 4.20 adds support for performing the translucency rendering pass using Instanced Stereo Rendering, which can significantly reduce CPU cost on translucency-heavy scenes. No content changes are needed; any project with Instanced Stereo enabled in the project settings will automatically get the benefits of Instanced Stereo Rendering.

## New: Magic Leap One&trade; Early Access Support

At GDC, we announced Early Access support for Magic Leap One&trade;: Creator Edition, a software toolkit for early development of experiences for Magic Leap's personal spatial computing platform, as part of a larger partnership between the two companies. As of Unreal Engine 4.20, you can develop for the Magic Leap One&trade; using the fully supported release of Unreal Engine. 

![image alt text](image_41.png)(w:930 convert:false)

Unreal Engine 4 support for Magic Leap One uses our built in frameworks for things like camera control, world meshing, motion controllers, and forward and deferred rendering. We've also added more robust support for features like eye tracking and gestures.

Developers can download the Magic Leap software development kit and simulator at [developer.magicleap.com](http://developer.magicleap.com).  For those developers with access to hardware, Unreal Engine 4.20 can deploy and run on the device in addition to supporting Zero Iteration workflows through Play In Editor.

## New: Apple ARKit 2.0 Support

We've added support for Apple's ARKit 2.0, which includes better tracking quality, support for vertical plane detection, face tracking, 2D image detection, 3D object detection, persistent AR experiences and shared AR experiences. Support for these new features enables you to place AR objects on more surfaces, track the position and orientation of a face, recognize and bring 2D images to life, detect 3D objects, and facilitate new types of collaborative AR experiences.

## New: Google ARCore 1.2 Support

We've added support for Google's ARCore 1.2, which includes support for vertical plane detection, Augmented Images, and Cloud Anchors. Support for these new features enables you to place AR objects on more surfaces, recognize and bring images to life, and facilitate new types of collaborative AR experiences.

It will convert from the old format of relative to game content to the new /Game/ format on startup. If you have any game-specific code accessing this you will have to take this into account

* **New:** Exposed an optional name to Create Dynamic Material Instance.

* **New:** Added a function, Is Async Loading Suspended, to check if async loading is currently suspended.

* **New:** Enabled the overloading of functions which take TFunction or TFunctionRef of different signatures when the lambda being passed to them will unambiguously bind to only one of the overloads.

* **New:** Changed Visual C++ debugger visualization of TFunctions to allow a lambda to be right-clicked on and the source jumped to by selecting "Go To Source Code".

* New: MallocStomp can now be enabled on desktop platforms using the "-stompmalloc" command line argument.

* **New:** Initial implementation of tracing profiler to show CPU and GPU on the same timeline. Use "TracingProfiler frames=N" console command to trigger a capture of the next N frames. Trace is saved to disk as a JSON file into the "Saved/Profiling/Traces" directory. Trace file uses Google Tracing format and can be visualized in Chrome built-in profiler (chrome://tracing).

* **New:** New parameter to "obj list" command, "-INSIDECLASS=classname", filters objects that are inside of all objects of the specified class.

    * Added command line param overrides: "-NoAsyncPostLoad" "-AsyncPostLoad"

* **Improvement:** Pak Signing: 

    * Unified naming of pak precacher and signed archive reader signature check functions to make it easier to search for them in crash reporter.

    * Formatted the signed archive reader output to match the pak precacher.

    * Optimization for pakprecacher signature checks. Instead of locking the cached files mutex for every decoded signature, take a local copy in blocks of 16.

* **Improvement:** Crypto: 

    * AES keys that are too long or short (need to be 32 bytes) will now emit a warning when being parsed, and be truncated or expanded before adding to the crypto settings. 

    * Signing keys will emit an error when they are too long (greater than 64 bytes).

    * Unrealpak will still assert when invalid settings are passed via the other mechanisms (command line or -encryptionini mode).

    * Settings via the crypto .json file should now be sanitized and not cause issues.

* **Improvement:** Headers for compressed blocks in a pak file now contain relative offsets, reducing the amount of data entropy between builds and improving patch efficiency.

* **Improvement:** Use-after-free detection mechanism and physical memory usage of MallocStomp on Windows. 

    * MallocStomp on Windows will now reserve virtual address space for every allocation and then commit physical pages only to the valid usable part. Physical pages will be unmapped on Free, but virtual address space will not be released and therefore will never be re-used.

* **Improvement:** Unhashing unreachable objects will now also be done incrementally, just like the purge phase of Garbage Collection. 

* **Improvement:** Faster GUID creation. Previous method used a system Date / Time system call, which could be slow on some platforms. This change can decrease GameThread time on those platforms.

* Deprecated: Direct access to Archive members Ar Is Text Format, Ar Want Binary Property Serialization, Ar Force Unicode, Ar Is Persistent, Ar Is Saving, Ar Is Transacting, Ar Licensee UE4 Ver, Ar Engine Ver, Ar Engine Net Ver and Ar Game Net Ver private. These should now only be accessed via their associated member functions.

* **Removed:** Packaged UE4 applications that you distribute will no longer send anonymous usage data to Epic. Previously, this had to be disabled in project settings.

* **New:** The Garbage Collector and the Async Loading Thread now coordinate timing, with the Async Loading Thread attempting to finish its current work to give GC a chance to run whenever GC sends a notification that it would like to run. The Async Loading Thread is more stable as a result.

* **New:** Added "gc.ForceCollectGarbageEveryFrame" console variable that triggers a forced GC every frame.

* **New:** Async package names will now be dumped to log when reporting Object references in Garbage Collection.

* **New:** Added the ability to sort clusters by name/object count/mutable object count/referenced clusters count when dumping them with "gc.ListClusters" command.

* **New:** Added the ability to toggle incremental BeginDestroy with "gc.IncrementalBeginDestroyEnabled".

* **Improvement:** Set the minimum GC cluster size to 5 with "gc.MinGCClusterSize" console variable so that GC doesn't have to process micro clusters, which are more expensive to process than individual objects. 

* **Improvement:** Optimized Mark Phase of Garbage Collection by up to 10ms (depends on the number of objects and the number of threads available) by making it run in parallel and removing a huge array preallocation which we didn't need.

* **Improvement:** Garbage Collector assumption verification should now be up to 4 times faster.

* **Bug Fix:** Allowed the use of PDBCOPY.EXE to be installed as part of the Windows 10 SDK to strip symbols, and add a better message if it can't be found.

* **Bug Fix:** While cooking on the fly a .pak file will no longer be produced. 

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed incorrect console colors being restored after a warning or error on Mac or Linux.

* **New:** Added a script to rewrite source files with public include paths relative to the 'Public' folder. 

* **New:** Added a -SeparateDebugInfo argument to Build Cook Run, which allows staging debug files to a separate output directory (for example, WindowsClientDebug). 

* **New:** Allow passing -Project<N>=Foo.uproject arguments to the MegaXGE commandlet so it can be used from an installed engine build. 

* **New:** Added an automation script for the CryptoKeys plugin which allows the cycling of encryption and signing keys from UAT.

* **New:** As a security measure, a warning will now be output when staging a project for any config files which are not whitelisted or blacklisted. 

* **New:** Added a Whitelist Directories list under the [Staging] category in DefaultEngine.ini, which allows specifying folders that can be staged despite having restricted folder names.

* **New:** Added Record Performance automation script for running demos multiple times, gathering performance stats and plotting results on charts.

##### BuildGraph

* **Bug Fix:** The Build Editor And Tools .xml script will no longer force copying files to a staging directory.

* **Bug Fix:** When Build Graph is run with the -Preprocess=... argument, no steps will be executed.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed "copy local" files not being included in build products enumerated from C# projects. 

* **Bug Fix:** Added a warning message when trying to use the <Submit> task without the -Submit argument being passed to UAT.

* **New:** Added a <Trace> element, which allows logging messages after the string is parsed (as opposed to the Log task, which logs them at runtime). 

* **New:** Added a -show diagnostics parameter, to have diagnostic messages output even when running with the -listonly option.

* **New:** Added support for enumerating content copied by the "CsCompile" task and support for invoking methods on string properties.

* **New:** When displaying an XML parse error it will now** **Include the path to the XML file. 

* **New:** Added support for user-defined macros, which can contain a list of BuildGraph commands to be expanded within a node. An example script is located in Engine/Build/Graph/Examples/Macros.xml.

* **Removed:** Files with "Embed Interop Types" from the output list have been removed.

##### UnrealBuildTool

* **Bug Fix:**  Exceptions are no longer thrown on a background thread while caching C++ includes which caused incorrect logging. It now captures exceptions and re-throws on the Main thread.

* **Bug Fix:** Allowed link time code generation on any configurations where b Allow LTCG is set to true.

* **Bug Fix:** When building with the UBT it will now explicitly query the number of logical processors in the system to fix Environment.Processor Count by returning the number available to the .NET framework. For machines with > 64 cores, processors in a different processor groups will not be included in this number.

* **Bug Fix:** The UBT will now always determine whether a project is a foreign project or not from the valid .uprojectdirs entries, rather than relying on the user passing -game on the command line.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed errors during incremental builds if a build contains an exported symbol change, but the build fails after the source files have been compiled but before the import library is built.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed an incremental build issue caused by force-included files not being treated as dependencies. 

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed issues caused by the tool chain assuming that the Editor target will be the name of the project with an "Editor" suffix. The launcher will allow you to instantiate a project with any name, and it will not rename the target files.

* **Bug Fix:** Changed RPC toolchain to abort early, rather than continue to try to build even though SSH init failed.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed platforms not adding response files as dependencies, causing incremental builds to fail if input files/compile arguments change.

* **Bug Fix:** Updated project file generator to support VS2017 solution options file; C# projects will no longer open by default when generating new project files.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed platforms overriding project generation.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a build failure that occurs on the very first build after adding new files with reflected types.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue where overlapping circular header dependencies would not be parsed correctly, preventing files not being rebuilt on header changes.

* **New:** Warnings and errors will output when compiling module rules assembly in a way that allows them to be double-clicked in the Visual Studio output window.

* **New:** Precompiled targets will now generate a separate manifest for each precompiled module. This fixes issues where object files from static libraries would not be linked into a target if a symbol in them was not referenced.

* **New:** Targets may now opt-out of having public include paths added for every dependent module. This reduces the command line length when building a target. All engine modules are compiled with this enabled; games may opt into it by setting bLegacyPublicIncludePaths = false; from their .target.cs.

* **New:** Unreal Build Tool now writes a log file to Engine/Programs/UnrealBuildTool/Log.txt, containing the regular console output and any reasons why actions are outdated and needed to be executed.

* **New:** C# projects for unsupported platforms are now excluded when generating project files.

* **New:** When building with Incredibuild, the agent executing the compile step is now shown by default.

* **New:** Unreal Build Tool will now validate that targets don't modify properties that affect other targets. Warnings are output for any include paths added via a .build.cs file that do not exist.

* **New:** Added a working directory setting to custom build steps.

* **New:** Added a new Build Configuration .xml setting <bMasterProjectNameFromFolder> which allows setting the solution name based on the folder that it's in, making it easier to distinguish between multiple instances of Visual Studio.

* **New:** The name of the UE4 solution can now be overridden on a branch-specific basis, making it easier to work with multiple open solutions at once. 

* **New:** Added a better error if an XML config file is corrupt.

* **New:** The engine will now use the Windows 10 SDK by default, if available. Projects can be configured to use older versions, if necessary.

* **New:** Added warnings whenever a module adds an include path or library path that doesn't exist.

* **New:** Only output a warning message if Build Configuration .xml schema validation fails; we may have settings that only apply to code in another branch.

* **New:** An "Engine Directory" property has been added to the Module Rules base class, making it easier to find paths to files under the Engine folder.

* **New:** Verbose timing information from the compiler frontend is now included with the bPrintToolChainTimingInfo option enabled if using VS2017 15.7 preview 2 or later.

* **New: **The UnrealBuildTool** **now enumerates all Visual Studio 2017 install locations using the Visual Studio Setup interop SDK, and supports multiple simultaneous Visual Studio installations.

* **New:** Additional compiler/linker arguments can now be set through properties on the TargetRules object again.

* **New:** Added support for reading the local PVS-Studio settings file to the PVS toolchain.

* **New:** Added a new executor for Windows which uses the Managed Process class, spawning child processes under a job object using P/Invoke to ensure that any child process is terminated if the build is canceled.

* **New:** Added support for multiple debug extensions.

##### UnrealGameSync(UGS)

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue where pop-up menus can create top level windows in the taskbar. 

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed notification window not expanding to fit long captions.

* **Bug Fix:** Pre compiled binaries no longer will not be shown as available for a change until scrolling the last submitted code change into the buffer. It now queries changes up to the last change for which zipped binaries are available.

* **Bug Fix:** The application lifecycle now uses a custom application context to allow creating separate 'main' windows, and does not require any forms to be shown in order to be updating in the background. This fixed issues with scheduled syncs on background windows not activating, and window jumping to the front after auto-update.

* **Bug Fix:** UnrealGameSync will now Detect if other programs are running before allowing a sync to start, show a dialog listing them, and give an option to ignore them if necessary.

* **Bug Fix:** Do not create a modal dialog if a scheduled sync is unable to run because the editor is open, and do not run the editor after a scheduled sync.

* **New:** Workspace sync filter categories are now able to re-enable categories that are disabled by the global filter.

* **New:** UnrealGameSync Launcher now shows an error window allowing setting default P4 server settings if syncing UGS fails.

* **New:** Files which are excluded by the sync filter will now be removed from the workspace when syncing. The user's config file stores a hash of the last sync filter. During syncing, if this hash doesn't not match the previous value, we enumerate all the files in the #have list and remove anything masked out by the filter.

* **New:** Added an option to allow setting a tint color to be applied to the status panel, to allow identifying streams more easily. 

* **New:** Columns are now automatically resized when the main window is resized, and default column widths for projects that have a large number of CIS badges can be specified in the project's UnrealGameSync.ini file.

* **New:** The stream name is now in tab labels by default.

* **New:** Added support for a per-branch "message of the day"-style feature. Messages can be specified in a project's config file in Perforce (eg. <ProjectDir>/Build/UnrealGameSync.ini).

* **New:** Added an extensible method for adding arbitrary badges to the right of the "description" column, by running a regular expression over the changelist description. **New: **Added an option to show changes by build machines, and move the "only show reviewed" option in there too (Options > Show Changes).

* **New:** UnrealGameSync now detects Perforce login tickets expiring, and allows entering login credentials.

* **New:** Added an option to prompt for arguments prompting before launching the editor.

* **New:** Added a "Bisect" mode for regressing bugs between a certain range of changes. 

* **New:** Moved the prompt to close the editor before allowing the user to enter a changelist to sync to, when syncing to a specific changelist.

* **New:** Added an error dialog when trying to clean the workspace before closing the editor.

* **New:** You can now select which projects to sync on schedule. Any projects not already opened at the time the schedule is triggered will be opened first.

* **New:** Added an option for syncing all projects in a branch. 

* **New:** Added support for masking in additional paths to be synced (eg. one or two extra projects) via the sync filter.

* **New:** The "clean workspace" functionality will now detect and force-sync files that have been deleted or made writable.

* **New:** You can now use a select stream dialog instead of displaying a drop list unless there's a stream filter specified. Makes it easier to find streams in large depots.

* **New:** Added UI to allow creating new workspaces and selecting projects from existing workspaces that are not currently synced.

##### UnrealHeaderTool

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed some cases where empty default values would be lost from UHT (eg, empty strings, null objects)

##### UnrealPak

* **New:** UnrealPak now logs the size of all encrypted data

* **New:** The key generator now only generates a prime table when required, not all the time

* **New:** Added a parameter for compression block size with -compressionblocksize=XXXX. Accepts arguments with MB/KB suffixes, as well as byte counts.

* **New:** Added support for custom compressors implemented via modular features. 

* **New:** Added an -overrideplatformcompressor argument that allows selecting compressor without using the default platform implementation.

* **New:** Added an option that allows rebuilding a set of PAK files with different settings. 


#### UI

* **Bug Fix:** Using scroll into view now selects the item being brought into view.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed improper scaling for on-screen debug messages, causing them to be hidden.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed Common Popup Menu staying on top of Activatable Panel stack even if the Popup Menu has been closed.

* **Bug Fix:** Set Common Text Block's inner Text Block to Self Hit Test Invisible when a scroll style is applied.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed monochromatic font rendering:

    * All non-8bpp images are now converted to 8bpp images for processing in Slate.

    * We convert the gray color of any images not using 256 grays (for example, monochromatic images that use 2 grays).

    * Added a CVar "Slate.EnableFontAntiAliasing" to control whether you want anti-aliased (256 grayscale) rendering (default), or monochromatic (2 grayscale) rendering.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed Canvas Safe Zone offset.

* **Bug Fix:** Hid the controller input on the Storm Shield check mark box.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed list views not wrapping properly in some cases.

* **New:** Added an event to Common List View for when an item has finished scrolling into view.

* **New:** Added support for TTC/OTC fonts:

    * These can be used via a sub-face index on FFontData, which can be set via a new combo in the Font Editor.

    * You can also see the cached list of sub-faces within a font file from the Font Face asset.

* **New:** Added "Allow Engine Tick" option to Loading Screen Attributes used when starting a loading screen movie. 

    * If set, it will run the main engine tick while waiting for a manually disabled loading screen to finish displaying. This enables latent actions such as level streaming to complete before stopping the load movie, but is disabled by default as it may not be safe for every game.

##### Slate

* **Crash Fix:** Fixed a crash when Object Table is null.

* **New:** Added "Show Only Keyable" and "Show Only Animated" to the Filter list in the property editor.

* **New:** The Slate Tree View is now able to show wires that clarify the parent-child. relationship of the items in the tree. It has been enabled in the Widget Reflector.

* **New:** Line and Spline rendering changes:

    * Lines/Splines now use 1 UV channel to anti-alias. The channel can be used for texturing.

    * Anti-aliasing filter will now be adjusted based on resolution.

    * Modified Line/Spline topology to accommodate new UV requirements.

    * Disabled vertex snapping for anti-aliased lines/splines; previously vertices were snapped, but vertex positions did not affect line rendering leaving the behavior effectively unchanged.

    * Splines now adaptively subdivide to avoid certain edge-cases.

* **New:** Added a way to defer Slate retainer widget render target updates until the end of Slate draw. This avoids the extra copy operations that result from switching render targets in the middle of the frame. This feature is controlled by the "Slate.DeferRetainedRenderingRenderThread" variable. Note that UI updates will render more quickly, but will show one frame later, if this feature is used. By default, this feature is enabled only on mobile devices.

##### UMG

* **Crash Fix:** Fixed a crash on adding an "On Clicked" event to a button in Widget BP.

* **Bug Fix:** In the UMG editor it will now indicate the name of the property that is not bound.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed template finish not getting called on stop. This fixes a bug where sections aren't restored when finished.

* **Bug Fix:** Refresh the widget preview even if the dragged widgets are dropped in an invalid location.

* **Bug Fix:** UMG evaluation will now properly finish on stop. 

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed incomplete state when undoing after deleting user widgets from the widget tree.

* **Bug Fix:** Widgets will not be removed from parent when they are pending garbage collection/

* **Bug Fix:** Replacing widgets should now also clear out references to the widget.

* **Bug Fix:** Reordering will now correctly handled by a undo, and will no longer cause a "ghost" widget to also be part of the tree.

* **Bug Fix:** Animating a Slate Brush's material will now invalidate the cached widget's layout and volatility when setting MIDs.

* **New:** Added right-click functionality to replace the object reference of a track with a different object in UMG Sequencer.

* **New:** Added support for 2D transform mask (translation, rotation, scale, shear).

* **New:** Improved copy/paste behavior for UMG editor:

    * Pasting in the Designer while a canvas is selected will place the new widget under the cursor.

    * Pasting multiple times while a canvas panel is selected in the hierarchy view will cascade the widgets starting at 0,0.

    * Pasting while something that isn't a panel is selected is now allowed, and will cascade the pasted widgets off the position of the selected widget (as siblings).

    * Newly pasted widgets will now be selected automatically.

    * Pasting multiple widgets at once will try and maintain their relative positions if they're being pasted into a canvas panel.

* **New:** Added a function to Scroll Box to determine what fraction of the window we're displaying.

* **Removed:** Removed legacy uses of Get Editor Icon from UMG.

* **New:** UserWidgets have a new setting to determine how the Widget will tick. By default, this will be set to "Auto", meaning Widgets will turn ticking on only in the following cases:

	* A latent action (such as Delay nodes) is triggered.

	* An animation was triggered.

	* A script implements the Tick event.

	* A native tick is assumed to exist (meaning the Widget lacks "DisableNativeTick" metadata).

* **New:** Added a new way to audit the tickability of a Widget with three Asset-Registry-searchable properties.

#### XR

* **Crash Fix:** Fixed a crash when setting screen percentage to less than 100 in VR preview.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug with Motion Controller Components not properly overriding the display model's material. XRAsset API now handles asynchronous resource loading. 

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed SteamVR headset detection on platforms with more than one GPU.

* **Bug Fix:** VR preview now works with dedicated server mode in the editor.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed late update floating point precision issues when far from the origin.

* **Bug Fix:** Improved tracking latency on Oculus. Cached poses are now updated at the end of the frame.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed an issue where aliased textures were mistakenly deleted by OpenGL.

* **Bug Fix:** Morpheus HMD "World To Meters Scale" now updates camera offset scale in "On Start Game Frame."

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug that caused a crash when using SteamVR motion controller models.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug that caused a slow down in reallocating render targets when using reflection captures in VR.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a bug that caused world locked stereo layers to drift on Oculus when using an explicit camera component.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a issue where the Oculus controller models wouldn't show up in cooked builds when using the motion controller's display model property.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed a crash that occurred when building lighting in VR.

* **New:** Added a label to the VR spectator screen render call so it is distinguishable in profiling tools, such as RenderDoc.

* **New:** Added the ability for Motion Controller components to track/display HMD devices by using "HMD" as the source name.

* **New:** Added experimental support for lens calibration on MR projects using OpenCV.

* **New:** Updated SteamVR SDK to version 1.0.11, this includes improved Vulkan support.

* **New:** Improved SteamVR compositor timing and overall engine performance through more accurate CPU utilization data.

* **New:** Added Render Bridge base class, FXRRenderBridge, to reduce code duplication when creating an XR Plugin with a Custom Present implementation.

* **New:** Added initial support for omni-directional stereo captures.

* **New:** Made Oculus code-scheduling functions available for use by other XR Plugins through the "Head Mounted Display" module.

* **New:** Added virtual curves for head rotation from FaceAR's face tracking LiveLink streaming.

* **New:** Added support for instanced stereo translucent rendering.

* **New:** Added support for enabling the ARKit 1.5 auto-focus setting.

* **New:** Added checks for ARKit 1.0 availability when creating the AR session, preventing calls to invalid selectors on older iOS devices.

* **New:** Added functions for checking ARKit version availability at runtime.

* **New:** Refactored how ARKit supports #define, simplifying wrapping individual features by ARKit version.

* **New:** Added a console command to change where Face AR is publishing LiveLink curve data. "LiveLinkFaceAR SendTo=192.168.1.1".

* **New:** Wrapped vertical plane detection in an "if iOS 11.3" check, since ARKit 1.5 is only available in 11.3 and later.

* **New:** Added orientation to the "AR Candidate Image" object for passing to the detection system.

* **New:** Added support for handling "AR Image Anchor" notifications from ARKit.

* **New:** Added a friendly name to UARCandidateImage objects.

* **New:** Added base types for detecting images in an AR session.

* **New:** Added the name from the candidate image when creating the Apple side representation.

* **New:** Improved debug layer rendering on Oculus, circumventing a superfluous blit by rendering directly to the layer.

* **New:** Added models to the Oculus plugin for HMD and Sensors.

* **New:** Added "Use Camera Rotation" feature to "Stereo Panorama" Plugin. Now this plugin can take the current camera's rotation. To enable this feature, use the console command "SP.UseCameraRotation 7".

* **New:** Updated Camera Component can now tell the "Late Update Manager" to store that we don't want to do a late update this frame. Default XR Camera checks this flag before applying the late update to the camera.

* **New:** Refactored PSVR Minor reprojection for Frame Counter comparison.

* **New:** Added a new PSVR API function for getting a transform between "floor" and "eye" tracking spaces.

* **New:** Added a new PSVR delegate that can detect when an app changes between "floor" and "eye" tracking space.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed issue where FBX Importer used the incorrect owner when creating asset import data.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed FBX Static Mesh re-import to properly match names between the existing data and the incoming FBX file.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed import socket logic for Static Meshes to prevent it from duplicating sockets when re-importing.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed issue where FBX Importer's Global Transform options were not persisting in config file.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed SColorGradingPicker, which were preventing PIE sessions from working.

* **Bug Fix:** Removed external profiling support from shipping builds to fix an issue that caused DLL queries for external profiles at start-up to fail.

* **Bug Fix:** Changed FPlatformTime::Seconds(), FPlatformTime::Cycles(), and FPlatformTime::Cycles64() on Android to use CLOCK_MONOTONIC instead of system time-of-day clock.

* **New:** Consolidated codepaths for embedding version information in the Engine.

    * Engine/Build/Build.version is now the authoritative place to configure version information.

    * Engine/Source/Runtime/Launch/Resources/Version.h no longer includes macros for the current branch and changelist.

    * These settings are compiled into the BuildSettings module at runtime rather than being exposed as global macros.

## UPGRADE NOTES

#### Animation

##### Control Rig

* **Removed:** Control Rig has been completely redone and the previous BaseHuman has been removed and will not work anymore. If you wish to still use the previous Control Rig, this build will break it. 

#### Core

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed archive serialization issues for archives larger than 4 GB.

* **Bug Fix:** UnrealHeaderTool now reports an error if a ufunction is used to mark up a function in a subclass where a ufunction of the same name already exists in the parent class, even if they have the same signature and markup data. To handle this situation:

    * For virtual functions, remove the UFUNCTION tag.

    * For blueprint implementable events, remove it entirely from the subclass. The parent class definition is adequate.

    * For blueprint native events and rep notifies, remove the UFUNCTION tag and instead simply define the "_Implementation" or "_Verify" virtual overrides as needed.

    * Any non-virtual cases that were essentially allowing parameter overloading for functions in blueprints we recommend renaming the functions and redirecting to new locations using CoreRedirects. At the very least, the base class version must be renamed, since the Engine will find that instead of your CoreRedirect.

#### Gameplay Framework

* Projects making use of gesture bindings will need to enable the gesture recognizer in the project's input settings.

* Direct access to UWorld::StreamingLevels, CurrentLevelPendingVisibility, CurrentLevelPendingInvisibility, bShouldForceUnloadStreamingLevels, and bShouldForceVisibleStreamingLevels, as well as most members of ULevelStreaming is no longer available. Instead, developers should use the appropriate get/set functions.

* Projects that were calling SetToDefaults to make sure that their overridden implementation was called may want to remove their calls to avoid duplicated work. If your project overrides SetToDefaults and gives it side effects or introduces a dependency on the order of operations, this change may force you to change that.

#### Online

* If you need to disable accepting compressed content, this is typically done on the webserver. The webserver should not be compressing images, since they are already compressed. If you need to prevent your game from ever accepting compressed HTTP content, this can be done with the .ini setting AcceptCompressedContent.

* There has been a data format change to the UserAgent string. If you have backend code identifying HTTP calls from the game based on the UserAgent string, it will need to be updated. 

* Added pure virtual GetType() to FUniqueNetId, implemented in all subsystems that use their own subclass of FUniqueNetId or FUniqueNetIdString. 

    * Created concrete types for all subsystems that were previously relying on a generic FUniqueNetIdString for their UniquePlayerIds, replaced all usages in their respective OnlineSubsystems with new type.

    *  FUniqueNetIdString now contains a "Type" member variable that can be set at construct time to denote which OnlineSubsystem is required to properly interpret/instantiate that type.

#### Platforms

##### XBox One

* You may now specify an optional DebugStackSizeOverride value in your XBox One target settings in the editor.

#### Rendering

* Meshes might have to be re-imported to get precision of tangents and normals back to where they were. Unfortunately the old serialized data only stored the already compressed values and realigning them (to allow zero as value) might cause jitters and imprecision, re-importing should fix those issues.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed crash when using FreezeRendering in non editor builds.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed quad overdraw viewmode contents remaining on screen after switching to certain other viewmodes (such as light overlap or complexity).

* **Bug Fix:** Enabling Forward Shading rather than the Mobile renderer on iOS now requires an Apple A9 or later iOS device.

##### FX

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed motion blur vectors on sprite particles.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed particle shadow, when using material with depth fade.

##### Lighting

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed white thumbnails bug when mobile preview is enabled.

#### Tools

##### UnrealBuildTool

* Errors and warnings from UnrealBuildTool are now output in a format that allows them to be double-clicked in the Visual Studio output window.

## PROGRAMMING UPGRADE NOTES

#### AI

##### Navigation

*  **New:** Most Navigation System-related code has been moved out of the Engine code and into a new Navigation System Module. Game-specific code using navigation system functionality might need to be updated.

    * Include statements need to be updated (the removal of the AI/Navigation part of the header files path should be sufficient).

    * NavigationSystem class has been renamed to UNavigationSystemV1.

    * Navigation-related entries in DefaultEngine.ini and DefaultGame.ini need to be updated manually.

    * NavigationSystem code being removed from the Engine module means you will have to add NavigationSystem module to your project's dependencies.

    * World->GetNavigationSystem was renamed to FNavigationSystem:::GetCurrent

    * GetMainNavData was replaced by GetDefaultNavDataInstance

    * This[ Python (3.5) script](https://epicgames.box.com/s/537wc3x95udak7uqq8wja19fyvbgz7ck) parses game's sources and points at lines that need updating.

        * Optionally, the script can perform the changes but make sure to use this option with caution and assisted by a version control system.

        * Script options can be found at the top of the file.

#### Animation

* **Bug Fix:** Removed unused CopySkinnedModelData function.

##### Animation Blueprints

* Exposed types on SkeletalControlBase to allow creation of derived classes.

* Added support for creating sub-classes of FAnimNode_StateMachine outside Engine module.

* Allowed UAnimNotify_PlayMontageNotify to be inherited by other modules.

* **Bug Fix:** Fixed sub-classes of FAnimNode_SkeletalControlBase not having deprecated CacheBones called.

##### Skeletal Mesh

* **Bug Fix:** Removed unused RigidInfluenceIndex from CPU skinning code.

* SkeletalMesh.LODInfo is also now private. You can use a function to add/remove LOD Setting, which ensures the correct setting is set when adding a new LOD.

#### Blueprints

* If you have a default implementation of a BlueprintNativeEvent's required _Implementation() method inside of an interface class, the default implementation must now be removed from the interface class.

* Removed FUnloadedClassDragDropOp as it was only used by the class viewer and had several issues. Any uses should be switched to use FAssetDragDrop instead.

#### Core

* Logging calls like UE_LOG() or GLog->Logf() will no longer compile if the formatting string is not a string literal. These should be updated.

* Direct access to FArchive members ArIsTextFormat, ArWantBinaryPropertySerialization, ArForceUnicode, ArIsPersistent, ArIsSaving, ArIsTransacting, ArLicenseeUE4Ver, ArEngineVer, ArEngineNetVer and ArGameNetVer should be replaced by their IsTextFormat(), WantBinaryPropertySerialization() etc. member functions.

* Added a value of Unkown to FCoreDelegates::ETemperatureSeverity enum (and mirrored ETemperatureSeverityType). This adjusts the integral values of each enum to ensure Unknown == 0.

* **Bug Fix:** StringToBytes() used to return a value one less than it should have. This has now been fixed, so if this error was being compensated for at the call site, the call should be updated.

* Renamed confusing argument in LineBoxIntersection function

#### Editor

* **Crash Fix:** Fix for crash when using macOS clipboard string copy commands.

* **Bug Fix:** macOS Play In Editor performance fix when key / mouse up event occurs.

##### Scripting

* Deprecated ExportToFileEx(), use newly created UAssetExportTask with RunAssetExportTask() instead of FExportToFileParams.

##### Sequencer

* All movie scene channel types must now implement FMovieSceneChannel.

#### Gameplay Framework

* Renamed the EReplicationMode enum used in AbilitySystemComponent to EGameplayEffectReplicationMode as the old name was misleading and too general for global scope. Also fixed several typos on function and variable names used in the ability system.

* Deprecated FSavedMove_Character::MovementMode in favor of StartPackedMovementMode and EndPackedMovementMode, so they are more explicit (about being packed modes) and capture the state separately at the start and end of the move.

#### Localization

* FInternationalization::GetCulturesWithAvailableLocalization was deprecated as it would only provide cultures that used LocRes files (ignoring additional localization text sources). This should be replaced with a call to FTextLocalizationManager::GetLocalizedCultureNames, and an optional call to FInternationalization::GetAvailableCultures if you need culture pointers (rather than just their names).

#### Networking

##### Replays

* FRepLayout::DiffProperties now takes an enum flag type instead of a bool as its last parameter.

#### Online

* See CurlHttpManager.cpp for more information on the AcceptCompressedContent INI setting. Also see CurlHttp.cpp where the curl option CURLOPT_ACCEPT_ENCODING is set to support curl's default encodings.

* The UserAgent is set in FGenericPlatformHttp::GetDefaultUserAgent.

* FUniqueNetIdString::FUniqueNetIdString(String) style constructors will likely be hidden soon to enforce usage of Type across the game.

* Calls to IXmppChat::SendChat and IXmppMessages::SendMessage will need to be updated.

* Bug Fix: Please note that Steam leaderboards no longer automatically increment variables (its original behavior was a bug). As such the new behavior follows that of other platforms.

* Bug Fix: The dedicated server fix introduces a new launch argument ("-force_steamclient_link") that can be used to force the steamclient link for dedicated server projects that require it.

#### Physics

##### Rigid Bodies

* Added ENGINE_API to UPhysicsHandleComponent so it can be sub-classed.

* Removed unnecessary InitialLinearVelocity vector from BodyInstance (reduces PrimitiveComponent size by 12 bytes).

* **Bug Fix:** Threading is no longer used for PhysX if ShouldUseThreadingForPerformance is false.

#### Rendering

* Bug Fix: Changed texture streaming to not use background task when FApp::ShouldUseThreadingForPerformance is false.

#### UI

##### Slate

* While *ITableRow* was never intended as a public-facing interface, some advanced programmers may have chosen to implement it. Two additional methods were added to the interface, so any code implementing *ITableRow *will have to add an implementation for these methods. Sample implementations can be found in *STableRow.h*.

#### XR

* If you maintain an XR plugin that implements IStereoRendering::GetCustomPresent, it should be removed.

* If you maintain a XR plugin implementation, please review the new FXRRenderBridge base class if your module needs to provide a custom present implementation.

## DEPRECATIONS

#### Animation

* **Removed:** BaseHuman has been removed and will not work anymore.

#### Blueprints

* Deprecated BlutilityActor & DatasmithBlutilityActor in favor of PlacedEditorUtilityBase. Existing data will migrate to PlacedEditorUtilityBase. PlacedEditorUtilityBase should be used for Blutility base class.

#### Core

* Deprecated Lex namespace and converted all existing methods to Lex- prefixed functions instead. This avoids issues with using the Lex namespace generically in the presence of 2-phase template instantiating compilers like clang.

* Passing anything other than a literal string to ensureMsgf() as its format string has now been deprecated. Please ensure formatting strings are always string literals.

* De-virtualized from FArchive::IsSaveGame() and FArchive::IsFilterEditorOnly(). Please ensure that your custom archives do not try to override these functions.

* Passing anything other than a literal string to FString::Printf() as its format string has now been deprecated. Please ensure formatting strings are always string literals.

#### Gameplay Framework

* FInputActionBinding::ActionName is now private. Direct setting after construction is no longer permitted, access to read the name can be done via GetActionName accessor.

#### Physics

##### Rigid Bodies

* Removed unused PhysX serialization support.

#### Programming

* Removed welded vertices option from the FBX exporter dialog. The vertices are always welded.

* Deprecated FindOverlappingCorners() storing data as TMultiMap<int32, int32>, replaced with struct FOverlappingCorners. New container is optimized for better performance and memory usage.

* Removed experimental "SubD Surface" feature. This feature was never completed, and will be superseded by Editable Mesh in a future release.

* Merge plugin AssetScriptingUtilititesEditor with plugin EditorScriptingUtilities. Existing data will be migrated.

#### Tools

* Removed old, invalid Niagara Collision Bounce module.
Please have your Niagara Emitters and Systems use the Collision Linear Impulse module.

##### BuildGraph

* UnrealFrontend is no longer included in the BuildEditorAndTools.xml script. This functionality is available through the editor, and is rarely required in standalone.

##### UnrealBuildTool

* The explicit construction of RuntimeDependency objects from .build.cs files is now deprecated. The path string can be added to the list of runtime dependencies instead.
