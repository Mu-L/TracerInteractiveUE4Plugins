Description:List of guidelines and items to address when shipping a game using Unreal Engine 4.
Version: 4.9

Once you have decided to use Unreal Engine 4 for your project, and your project is nearing completion, 
there are some actions that must be taken and verified before the project ships. This document contains 
a collection of notes and documents related to shipping an authorized game project using Unreal Engine 4.

If you are using Unreal Engine 4 for your project, you are a **Licensee**. Your project is an **Authorized Game** (or **Game**).

## Required Trademark Notice

Licensee must display the trademark notice wherever the Unreal Technology logo is used (such as on the back 
of the box for Authorized Game).

	"Unreal, Unreal Technology and the Powered by Unreal Technology logo are trademarks or registered trademarks of Epic Games, Inc. in the United States and elsewhere."

## Required Copyright Notice

Licensee must display the copyright notice somewhere in the legal text for Authorized Game (such as the manual).

	"Unreal Engine, Copyright 1998 - 20xx, Epic Games, Inc.  All rights reserved."

20xx = year you release authorized Game.

Legal text is not required in the credits as long as it is included elsewhere in the Game; or unless other 
legal text is used in the credits, as well.


## Required Logo Placement

Wherever the Unreal Technology logo is used with Authorized Game, the trademark notice should be used (such 
as on the back of the box for the Game). 

Licensee agrees to display the "Powered by Unreal Technology" logo on the physical packaging of the Game. 
Licensee also agrees to display the "Powered by Unreal Technology" logo within the opening sequence or splash 
screen of the Game. Licensee agrees that any display of the "Powered by Unreal Technology" logo will comply 
with the **_Unreal Engine Style Guide_** which can be found on the [Logo & Branding](https://www.unrealengine.com/branding) page.

As an alternative to static logos, an animated version is also available.

The Unreal Technology logo is not required on any labels for physical media (floppy disks, CDs, or DVDs).


## Third Party Software

Licensee must also provide appropriate legal notices required by any other third party software used in the 
Game.

## Sanctioned Content

Other games or products may ship with versions of Unreal Editor which allow users to create content that could 
potentially be compatible with Authorized Game unless Licensee implements safeguards against such user content. 
If Authorized Game should not be compatible with user content from other sources, Licensee must take steps to 
ensure Authorized Game only accepts content from sanctioned tools, e.g. the editor for Authorized Game. It is 
Licensee's sole responsibility to make Authorized Game impervious to said content.
