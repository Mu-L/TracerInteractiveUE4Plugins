Description:Documentation covering how to properly search for content within the UDN.
Version: 4.9



Searching for content within the Support Portal or documentation is done via the search bar, located in the header at the top-right of any page.

When searching, you can use the search filters to focus your incoming results. These will appear once focus has been placed on the search bar.

You can add terms to the search by using the **+** sign, and remove them using **-** instead. 

In this example, we are searching for the terms _materials_ and _textures_, but are removing the term _functions_ from the results.
