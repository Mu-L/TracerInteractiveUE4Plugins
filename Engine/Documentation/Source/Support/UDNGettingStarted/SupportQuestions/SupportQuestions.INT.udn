If you are experiencing problems and/or require assistance, you may post a question in our Support Portal. This is accessible from any page using the **Post a Question** link located in the header, or by using the **Start asking a question** button from the home page.

**Please make sure to ask your question in the appropriate section (especially for those related to specific platforms)**. This helps to ensure that your question will be addressed in a timely manner and makes it easily discoverable by others who may be looking for the information in the future.
 
There are multiple different sections on the UDN site where you can post your questions, including areas for programming or content specific questions, questions related to specific platforms, and specific language sections. New questions will default to the section you are currently viewing, with the exception of the home page.
 
You can choose a section when posting your question using the dropdown menu:

## Team Questions

If you are interested in only seeing questions posted by your development team, you can use the **Posts by My Team** section, available for the home page. This is useful to quickly filter out any questions note specifically related to your work.

## Controlling Visibility

If your question contains topics or content that you need to keep between your team and Epic, then you may check the **Make this question visible only to support staff** checkbox, located just above the WYSIWYG editor. This will prevent the question from being posted publicly.

## Tips

On the right side of the **Ask a question** page is a context sensitive tips area to help you as you fill in the title and content of your post.

When typing the title of your question, this box updates to offer some useful tips to make the most of your title.

When typing the body of your question, this box will update to give you useful tips on formatting. We use the Markdown formatting engine, and the Tips box will show you the symbols you can use to properly format such things as bold and italic text, as well as numbered and bulleted lists. Alternatively, you may use the buttons within the WYSIWYG editor.

## Tags

When asking a question, is required that you add tags to help narrow down the systems related to your issue. You may add these manually by typing them into the tag line, or click on popular tag buttons to choose from some common ones. You may have up to 5 tags.
