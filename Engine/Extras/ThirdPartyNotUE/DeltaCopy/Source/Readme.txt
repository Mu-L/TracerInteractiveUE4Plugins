DeltaCopy Readme and compilation instructions
---------------------------------------------


In order to recompile DeltaCopy you will need:

1.	Borland C++ Builder 2006 (BDS)
2.	Synapse SMTP component from http://synapse.ararat.cz


The SMTP component is written in Pascal, not in C++. BDS will create 
necessary .hpp files during compilation. The generated .hpp files may have some compilation error. Comment out the lines that generate errors.
