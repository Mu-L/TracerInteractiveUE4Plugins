// This tries to evaluate global ctors at compile-time, applying their effects
// into the mem init file. This saves running code during startup, and also
// allows removing the global ctor functions and other code that only they used,
// so this is also good for reducing code size. However, this does make the
// compile step much slower.
//
// This basically runs the ctors during compile time, seeing if they execute
// safely in a sandbox. Any ffi access out of asm.js causes failure, as it could
// do something nondeterministic and/or alter some other state we don't see. If
// all the global ctor does is pure computation inside asm.js, it should be ok.
// Run with EMCC_DEBUG=1 in the env to see logging, and errors when it fails to
// eval (you'll see a message, or a stack trace; in the latter case, the
// functions on the stack should give you an idea of what ffi was called and
// why, and perhaps you can refactor your code to avoid it, e.g., remove
// mallocs, printfs in global ctors).
//
// This optimization can increase the size of the mem init file, because ctors
// can write to memory that would otherwise be in a zeroinit area. This may not
// be a significant increase after gzip, if there are mostly zeros in there, and
// in any case the mem init increase would be offset by a code size decrease.
// (Unless you have a small ctor that writes 'random' data to memory, which
// would reduce little code but add potentially lots of uncompressible data.)
//
// LLVM's GlobalOpt *almost* does this operation. It does in simple cases, where
// LLVM IR is not too complex for its logic to evaluate, but it isn't powerful
// enough for e.g. libc++ iostream ctors. It is just hard to do at the LLVM IR
// level - LLVM IR is complex and getting more complex, this would require
// GlobalOpt to have a full interpreter, plus a way to write back into LLVM IR
// global objects.  At the asm.js level, however, everything has been lowered
// into a simple low level, and we also just need to write bytes into an array,
// so this is easy for us to do, but not for LLVM. A further issue for LLVM is
// that it doesn't know that we will not link in further code, so it only tries
// to optimize ctors with lowest priority. We do know that, and can optimize all
// the ctors.
