/*
Like many third party headers, OpenCV headers require some care when importing.

When including opencv headers, the includes should be wrapped like this:

	OPENCV_INCLUDES_START
	#undef check 

	// your opencv include directives go here...

	OPENCV_INCLUDES_END

Note that the #undef directive is required. The START/END macros will ensure that 
the previous value is saved and restored, but due to limits of the preprocessor 
cannot undefine the value.
