/**
 * World Subsystem responsible for managing AColorCorrectRegion classes in level.
 * This subsystem handles:
 *		Level Loaded, Undo/Redo, Added to level, Removed from level events.
 * Unfortunately AActor class itself is not aware of when it is added/removed, Undo/Redo etc in the level.
 * 
 * This is the only way (that we found) that was handling all region aggregation cases in more or less efficient way.
 *		Covered cases: Region added to a level, deleted from level, level loaded, undo, redo, level closed, editor closed:
 *		World subsystem keeps track of all Regions in a level via three events OnLevelActorAdded, OnLevelActorDeleted, OnLevelActorListChanged.
 *		Actor classes are unaware of when they are added/deleted/undo/redo etc in the level, therefore this is the best place to manage this.
 * Alternative strategies (All tested):
 *		World's AddOnActorSpawnedHandler. Flawed. Invoked in some cases we don't need, but does not get called during UNDO/REDO
 *		AActor's PostSpawnInitialize, PostActorCreated  and OnConstruction are also flawed.
 *		AActor does not have an internal event for when its deleted (EndPlay is the closest we have).
