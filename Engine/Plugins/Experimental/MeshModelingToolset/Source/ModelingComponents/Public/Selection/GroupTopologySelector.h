/**
 * FGroupTopologySelector implements selection behavior for a FGroupTopology mesh.
 * Groups, Group Edges, and Corners can be selected (optionally configurable via UpdateEnableFlags).
 * Internally a FGeometrySet3 is constructed to support ray-hit testing against the edges and corners.
 * 
 * Note that to hit-test against the mesh you have to provide a your own FDynamicMeshAABBTree3.
 * You do this by providing a callback via SetSpatialSource(). The reason for this is that
 * (1) owners of FGroupTopologySelector likely already have a BVTree and (2) if the use case
 * is deformation, we need to make sure the owner has recomputed the BVTree before we call functions 
 * on it. The callback you provide should do that!
 * 
 * DrawSelection() can be used to visualize a selection via line/circle drawing.
 * 
 * @todo optionally have an internal mesh AABBTree that can be used when owner does not provide one?
