			* Sub-frame accumulation is surprisingly nuanced and complicated. Unreal's real-time motion blur is
			* is an approximation that derives a velocity (per-vertex) by taking the difference in positions per 
			* frame and then simulates a 'centered' motion blur, blurring pixels on either side of the object.
			* The amount of pixels that are blurred is determined by the Shutter Angle ("Motion Blur Amount").
			* Because we are simulating a higher quality version of the existing motion blur, we override the
			* Shutter Angle to 360 during accumulation frames, as they are designed to represent one long blur
			* and we emulate the shutter angle ourself over multiple frames.
			*
			* Different industries have different needs for when data is collected relative to an output frame.
			* Since a "frame" is a span of time, and a non-360 shutter angle determines that no photons would
			* accumulate while it is closed, there are three options for what period of time makes up the frame.
			* In addition to the sampling being shifted, there may also be a brightness curve that gets applied
			* to each shutter type during the accumulation frame, as choosing to give a particular frame more
			* weight during the accumulation will make it brighter and thus appear to have more influence. This
			* is handled during the accumulation/pixel data instead of shifting samples around as that would make
			* the timing on this very complicated.
			*
			* In the diagram below, 'f' marks an output frame, 's' marks the shutter-angle (180 in this case)
			* and it is assumed there are four motion samples ('-')
			*
			* f         f         f         f
			* |    s    |    s    |    s    |
			* |    |    |    |    |    |    |
			*       ----     Frame Close
			*         -- --   Frame Center
			*		     ---- Frame Open
			* Frame Closed - In this scenario, a given frame 'n' is when the shutter should close, meaning that
			*                the accumulation is the motion that happened before the frame.
			* Frame Center - In this scenario, a given frame 'n' is split evenly with half of the motion coming
			*                from before that frame, and half afterwards. In this diagram, the space in the
			*                middle is irrelevant (-- --), and is just there to make the diagram line up evenly.
			* Frame Opened - In this scenario, a given frame 'n' is when the shutter should open, meaning that
			*                the accumulation is the motion that happens after the frame.
			*
			* Depending on the shutter angle the spacing between the frames will change, ie: 270 shutter angle
			* means that the accumulation will happen across 75% of the time. In the example below, this assumes
			* that you are using Frame Close, meaning that the 75% of time before each frame.
			* 
			* f         f         f         f
			* |  s      |  s      |  s      |
			* |  |      |  |      |  |      |
			*     ------    ------    ------ Frame Close accumulation.
			*
			* The above offset (Frame Open/Closed/Centered) is the first timing offset that we apply, which only
			* changes what data is sampled to be considered a given frame n. We need to apply a second offset to
			* our sampling, because motion blur is centered around the object. For our motion blur to accurately
			* represent the period of time denoted on the chart, we need to offset the sample by half of the length
			* of a sub-frame so that when the blur is applied on either side of it, no pixels beyond where the frame
			* lies are affected.
			*
			* These offsets are calculated at the start of the shot and counter-adjusted for when calculating out which
			* frame number the output frames should end up with.
			*
			* In the diagram below, 'f' marks an output frame, 's' marks the shutter angle time, and '-' marks where
			* we actually sample time to generate a sub-frame (for which there are 4 in this example).
			*
			* f               f               f
			* |       s       |       s       |
			* |       |       |       |       |
			* |       |-|-|-|-|               |
			*
			* Finally, the tricky part. Because time in Unreal only goes forward (due to world tick) and renders may
			* be very expensive, we need to minimize any extra, unnecessary renders. To emulate Shutter Angle, there is
			* a period of time where the shutter is closed. We still need this time to pass in the world, but we don't
			* want our camera motion blur to stretch to cover this gap. One solution would be to render an extra frame
			* (with a duration of |-|) right before the first accumulation frame but this would be unnecessarily expensive.
			* 
			* Instead, what we do is we jump from the last accumulation frame to the start of the next frame (keeping in
			* mind that we have a timing offset meaning that we're in the center of the frame), but we override the motion
			* blur for this frame and say that the motion blur only has an effective length matching |-|, even though 
			* |-----| time has passed. Our motion blur amount is a 0-1 fraction, so to calculate the desired motion blur
			* for the first frame we take the length of a sub-frame and divide it by the total number of time that has
			* passed. Because the motion blur is centered and we've landed in the middle of the first accumulation frame
			* this ends up being the correct length and centered at the correct period of time. Yay!
			*
			* f               f               f
			* |       s       |       s       |
			* |       |       |       |       |
			* |       |-|-|-|-|       |-|-|-|-|
			*                ^         ^
			*        Jump From         Jump To
			*
			* The only remaining thing to watch out for is accumulation drift. The Movie Pipeline does not rely on 
			* accumulating delta times via engine-tick (even though we control engine tick) to avoid any floating point
			* issues. Instead, we calculate the exact number of ticks to move each time and store the accumulated time as 
			* ticks. Integers don't drift, but certain tick rates/accumulation sub-frame counts can end up not moving time
			* forward by a whole number.
			*
			* Given a default tick rate of 24,000 ticks per second and a output frame rate of 24fps, we have 1,000 ticks to
			* represent each frame. This is a great deal of precision, but it doesn't divide evenly by the number of samples
			* they may choose, such as three. 1000/3 = 333.3333 ticks per sub-frame. Since ticks are our finest resolution
			* we have to either advance time by 333 or 334. To account for this, we need a running tally of how much we're
			* drifting behind and then add it once it crosses the threshold.
			*
			* The reason we derive the Sequence time from our own time, and we derive our own time from the series of multiple
			* samples, is to handle slo-mo tracks. Slo-mo is not linear and can change each frame (which is why we multiply our
			* final delta amount by it) but to ensure the newly generated frames have the most correct timecode we move time
			* on our own, and find the nearest frame number and timecode from the sequence. When slo-mo tracks are not in play
			* the numbers should always add up evenly and it will be an exact 1-to-1 match.
			*
			* Easy!

		* duration and add half of it back, meaning we only sample information

		* 270* Shutter Angle means the shutter is open for 750 ticks (1000*0.75)
