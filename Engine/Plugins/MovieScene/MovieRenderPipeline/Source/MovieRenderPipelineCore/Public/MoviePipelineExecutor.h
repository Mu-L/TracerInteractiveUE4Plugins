/**
* A Movie Pipeline Executor is responsible for executing an array of Movie Pipelines,
* and (optionally) reporting progress back for the movie pipelines. The entire array
* is passed at once to allow the implementations to choose how to split up the work.
* By default we provide a local execution (UMoviePipelineLocalExecutor) which works
* on them serially, but you can create an implementation of this class, change the 
* default in the Project Settings and use your own distribution logic. For example,
* you may want to distribute the work to multiple computers over a network, which
* may involve running command line options on each machine to sync the latest content
* from the project before the execution starts.
