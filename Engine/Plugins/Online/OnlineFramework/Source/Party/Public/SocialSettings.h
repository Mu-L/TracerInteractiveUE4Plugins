	 * For these cases, the linked account ID stored on the Primary UserInfo for this particular OSS will be prefixed with the specific environment in which the linkage exists.
	 * Additionally, the prefix must be prepended when mapping the external ID to a primary ID.
	 * Overall, it's a major hassle that can hopefully be done away with eventually, but for now is necessary to fake environmental behavior on OSS' without environments.
