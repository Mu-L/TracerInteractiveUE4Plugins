9-2-2020:

Update for root motion. This improves on the previous implementation:
-UMockRootMotionSource as a base class for "root motion defining thing".
-New source types can be added without modifying the root motion simulation or driver code.
-Sources can have networked internal state and parameters.
-The root motion source is net serialized as a {SourceID, StartTime, Parameters} tuple via TMockRootMotionSourceProxy
-Sources define how their internal state/parameters are encoded into the Parameters blob via UMockRootMotionSource::SerializePayloadParameters
-Encoding SourceID is done through a new 

This pattern is very relevenant for things like custom movement modes or other data-driven extensions of simulations.

Minor updates:
-Trace local frame offset to Insights. 
-Store latest simulation time in FNetworkPredictionStateView
-Fix a couple issues where wrong time/frame was being traced, causing bugs in Insights



8-10-2020:

Initial mock root motion checked in. This is the begining of root motion networking which will find its way into the new movement system.
Initial focus is just on having montage-based root motion support back in, plus non animation based sources like curves (more to come here).
The animation team is planning for other animation based root motion sources.

Couple notable changes related to physics and UPrimitiveComponents

The system now defaults to "UPrimitiveComponents are always in sync with their physics data when NP SimulationTick functions run".
If you look at the previous version of FMockPhysicsSimulation::SimulationTick, we had to be very careful to interface directly
with the underlying PhysicsActorHandle, rather than reading data off of any UPrimitiveComponents. This causes some pretty
nasty anti-patterns, especially around scene queries.

The cost is that we have to take a seperate pass during rollback for everyone to "RestoreFrame" prior to *anyone* resimulating
a tick step. So, an extra pass through the registered instances and touching more memory than we did before.

It would be possible to allow users to opt out of this: to say "I know what I'm doing and I am confident I can write all
of my NP Code to interface directly with the physics engine". 

We will see if this shows up in profiles as the system continues to mature and we build real stuff with it. For now we think
its wiser to error on the side of being user friendly and less error prone.


The specific changes here are:
-PhysicsActorHandle is no longer a side cart of data registered with the Driver/Simulation. 
-We now require FNetworkPredictionDriver<ModelDef>::GetPhysicsPrimitiveComponent() to get to the physics data.
-"RestoreFrame" is a driver-level function similiar to FinalizeFrame but is called only during resims where we want to push
	the given sync/aux state to the physics scene (Whatever that means for you).	
	The default implementation is provided for physics and doesn't need the user to implement anything.



7-24-2020:

Physics issues should be fixed. Still tracking down a few more bugs in the cue and interpolation systems.

7-2-2020: Big Update

This checkin is a large refactor of the NetworkPrediction system. We hope this is the last big set of changes, though
there is still work to do. User code requires some fixups but should be a straight forward port overall. All existing 
examples have been updated. See "Upgrade Notes" below.

The primary motivation behind these changes are supporting Group Rollback and Physics. Group Rollback just meaning
forward predicting multiple actors in step together.

Group rollback and physics are supported only in fixed tick mode. Fix tick mode is now a global/system wide thing
rather than a per-simulation setting. In other words, previously each simulation could choose its tick settings and
would effectively be a black box in terms of when it decided to run a sim frame. Now, all fixed ticking happens
at the system level: in UNetworkPredictionWorldManager.

The system still supports what we are calling Independent Ticking: where a client-controlled simulation is ticked
on the server at the same timesteps that the controlling client does (e.g, the client's local frame rate). Simulations
running in independent mode cannot participate in group or physics rollback/resimulates. They are effectively on their
own. This means that only the client-controlled simulation state is forward-predictable. In independent mode, you do 
not forward predict other simulations.

To restate this:
-Simulations can either tick A) independently or B) fixed.
-There is one fixed tick "group". There can be N independent ticking simulations (and are all completely independent).
-Independent only allows forward prediction of the client controlled simulation state (E.g, movement, GAS, etc).
-Fixed tick allows multiple actors, including non client-controlled actors to be forward predicted in step with the client.
-Fixed tick is the only mode that supports physics. More notes on physics below.

Fix vs Independent ticking can be set at a few levels:
-The ModelDef itself can define what tick modes it supports via FNetworkPredictionDriver. "Capabilities"
-(By default, simulations that use Physics are only capable of fixed ticking)
-On spawned instances of a simulation, the authority can set fix/ticked (if both are supported). "Archetype".
-For cases where both modes are available, Project Settings -> Network Prediction (DefaultNetworkPrediction.ini) has 
	default tick mode settings. (E.g, it will eventually fall back to this in most cases).


Physics:

*** Currently, this requires the engine to run in fixed tick mode itself. ***
*** We are looking into expanding our support for fixed tick physics within a variable ticking engine. ***
*** Engine Fixed tick mode will be enabled by default if you are using physics, via the bForceEngineFixTickForcePhysics 
	property in Project Settings -> Network Prediction ***


-Physics support allows physics state to be recorded and resimulated by the physics engine (Chaos) itself.
-Chaos is being optimized to allow fast recording and resimulate steps.
-Physic-only sims are supported: e.g, an actor whose physics state is predicted but has no underlying NP state/tick.
-Physics + NP is also supported: e.g, a vehicle that has physics state and also a NP state/tick.


There are additional changes around how the game code binds/interfaces with the NetworkPrediction system. The hope is
that the new version is simplified and has less confusing boilerplate. Most of this is now done through the 
FNetworkPredictionProxy struct. Refer to the example to see what has changed.


Incomplete Features:
-Simulation Extrapolation has temporarily been removed. We support interpolation and forward prediction right now.
-Network Prediction Insights is due for a pass to better visualize these changes (mainly physics and group reconcile)
-Generalized server-side record/rewind (e.g, "lag compensation"). This will be an important part for independent ticking.
-Aux state is no longer stored sparsely, we intend to fix this.
-Some issues remain around independent ticking and cues. Working on fixing these.


// -------------------------------------------------------------
// Upgrade notes (7-2-2020)
// -------------------------------------------------------------

* ::Log function on user states has been changed to ::ToString(FAnsiStringBuilder&), you must now build ansi strings.
	Careful not to use FVector::ToString functions that build TCHARS. This is an inconvenience but makes tracing 
	state for Network Prediction Insights much more efficient. 

* TNetworkSimBufferTypes renamed --> TNetworkPredictionStateTypes

* FNetSimModelDefBase renamed --> FNetworkPredictionModelDef. There are additional changes to this:

	* NP_MODEL_BODY (in header) and NP_REGISTER_MODELDEF macros are required for registering model defs

	* Simulation, StateTypes (previously BufferTypes), and Driver are now defined in the ModelDef.

	* ::GetName() and ::GetSortPriority() are also defined on the ModelDef.

* The "Driver" is no longer a virtual interface that is inherited by the driving object (actor/component). The driver
	class is just defined in the ModelDef and functions are called directly on it. This is done through FNetworkPredictionDriver.

* ::InstantiateNetworkedSimulation renamed --> ::InitializeNetworkPredictionProxy 

* Use NetworkPredictionProxy.Init<ModelDef>:: in InitializeNetworkPredictionProxy. You will need to manually include 
	NetworkPredictionProxyInit.h in the file that does this (do not include that in the header of your actor/component).

* FNetworkSimTime has been removed, we now use int32 for simulation time in the system. The wrapped structure was
	not adding any real safety and was just getting in the way.

* FinalizeFrame, ProduceInput now take pointers instead of references. This is to accommodate ModelDefs that have void
	types (e.g, not AuxState. This allow for ::FinalizeFrame(const FSyncState*, const void*).

* GetDebugName, GetVLogOwner, VisualLog are gone. Generic implementations of these for actors/components are now done in
	FNetworkPredictionDriver. You can customize this behavior for your defs by specializing FNetworkPredictionDriver on your
	ModelDef type.

* TNetSimInput/TNetSimOutput now have pointers instead of references. Same reason as ProduceInput/FinalizeFrame: to support
	void* cases.

* TNetSimStateAccessor has been removed. You can now read/write to simulation state through the NetworkPredictionProxy
	in a similar way. Note that you will need to explicitly include NetworkPredictionProxyWrite.h to any files that does this.
	
* You may need to include "Chaos" in your PublicDependencyModuleNames. Looking at a way to not require this but am not sure
	it will be possible. 


// -------------------------------------------------------------
//	System Overview
// -------------------------------------------------------------

NetworkPrediction is a generalized system for client-side prediction. The goal here is to separate the gameplay code
from the networking code: prediction, corrections, resimulates, etc.

The core of the system is user states and a SimulationTick function. User states are divided into three buckets. These
are implemented as structs:

InputCmd: The state that is generated by a controlling client.
SyncState: The state that primarily evolves frame-toframe via a SimulationTick function.
AuxState: Additional state that can change but does .

Given these state types, user then implements a SimulationTick function which takes an input {Inputcmd, Sync, Aux} and
produces output {Sync, Aux}. These inputs and outputs are what is networked.

An event system, called Cues, is also available for managing non simulation affecting events that are emitted during
the SimulationTick. Prediction and rollback support is generically provided for these.

NetworkPredictionExtras is a supplementary plugin with sample content.

NetworkPredictionInsights is a tool for debugging the Network Prediction system. Demo can be found here:

// -------------------------------------------------------------
//	Getting Started
// -------------------------------------------------------------

MockNetworkSimulation.h - entry point for simple example use case. See how a simple simulation is defined and how an
actor component is bound to it at runtime.

NetworkPredictionWorldManager.h - top level entry point for the system. See what happens each frame, how simulations
are managed and coordinated.

NetworkPredictionPhysicsComponent.h - Example of binding a physics-only sim. 

MockPhysicsSimulation.h - Simple "controllable physics object" example. 


// -------------------------------------------------------------
//	Road Map
// -------------------------------------------------------------

Network Prediction is still a WIP. We don't foresee any more major changes but until it is officially released and 
out of beta, there is a risk of API changes.

The plan is to replace the current UCharacterMovementComponent and provide updates to GameplayAbilities so that all
prediction is unified across these systems, plus is easier to extend/modify on a per project basis.
