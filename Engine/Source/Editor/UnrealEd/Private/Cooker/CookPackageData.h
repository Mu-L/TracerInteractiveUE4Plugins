	 * Contains all the information the cooker uses for a package, during request, load, or save.  Once allocated, this structure is never deallocated or moved for a given package; it is
	 * deallocated only when the CookOnTheFlyServer is destroyed.
	 *
	 * RequestedPlatforms - RequestedPlatforms are the Platforms that will be Saved during cooking.
	 *   RequestedPlatforms is only non-empty when the Package is InProgress (e.g. is in the RequestQueue, LoadReadyQueue, or other state containers).
	 *   Once a Package finishes cooking, the RequestedPlatforms are cleared, and may be set again later if the Package is requested for another platform.
	 *   If multiple requests occur at the same time, their RequestedPlatforms are merged.
	 *   Since modifying the RequestedPlatforms can put an InProgress package into an invalid state, direct write access is private; use UpdateRequestData or SetRequestData to write.

	 * CookedPlatforms - CookedPlatforms are the platforms that have already been saved in the lifetime of the CookOnTheFlyServer; note this extends outside of the current CookOnTheFlyServer session.
	 *   CookedPlatforms also store a flag indicating whether the cook for the given platform was successful or not.
	 *   CookedPlatforms can be added to a PackageData for reasons other than normal Save, such as when a Package is detected as not applicable for a Platform and its "Cooked" operation is therefore a noop.
	 *   CookedPlatforms can be cleared for a PackageData if the Package is modified, e.g. during editor operations when the CookOnTheFlyServer is run from the editor.
	 *
	 * Package - The package pointer corresponding to this PackageData.
	 *   Contract for the lifetime of this field is that it is only set after the Package has passed through the load state, and it is cleared when the package returns to idle or is demoted to an earlier state.
	 *   At all other times it is nullptr.
	 *
	 * State - the state of this PackageData in the CookOnTheFlyServer's current session. See the definition of EPackageState for a description of each state.
	 *   Contract for the value of this field includes membership in the corresponding queue such as SaveQueue, and the presence or absence of state-specific data.
	 *   Since modifying the State can put the Package into an invalid state, direct write access is private; SendToState handles enforcing the contracts.

 	 * PendingCookedPlatformData - a counter for how many objects in the package have had BeginCacheForCookedPlatformData called and have not yet completed.
	 *   This is used to block the package from saving until all objects have finished their cache
	 *   It is also used to block the package from starting new BeginCacheForCookedPlatformData calls until all pending calls from a previous canceled save have completed.
	 *   The lifetime of this counter extends for the lifetime of the PackageData; it is shared across CookOnTheFlyServer sessions.
	 *
	 * CookedPlatformDataNextIndex - Index for the next (Object, RequestedPlatform) pair that needs to have BeginCacheForCookedPlatformData called on it for the current PackageSave.
	 *   This field is only non-zero during the save state; it is cleared when successfully or unsucessfully leaving the save state.
	 *   The field is an object-major index into the two-dimensional array given by {Each Object in GetCachedObjectsInOuter} x {each Platform in RequestedPlatforms}
	 *   e.g. the index into GetCachedObjectsInOuter is GetCookedPlatformDataNextIndex() / RequestedPlatforms.Num() and the index into RequestedPlatforms is GetCookedPlatformDataNextIndex() % RequestedPlatforms.Num()
	 *
	 * Other fields with explanation inline
