	-	Check out these files for reference:
		-	//depot/UE4/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/libPNG/UE4_BuildThirdPartyLib.bat
		-	//depot/UE4/Engine/Source/ThirdParty/libPNG/UE4_BuildThirdPartyLib_Mac.command
	-	Make new files with the same names in the root of your library directory.
		-	The program that builds the libraries will automatically find the script and call it if it exists
		-	You will likely have to open projects in Visual Studio or Xcode to find out the name of the targets, etc
		-	For the Mac script, you should to chmod a+x it
	-	Some notes on writing the files
		-	Since the script is in the root of the lib dir, pushd into the necessary directories to do the compiling
		-	Make sure check out the libraries before you compile them, using the THIRD_PARTY_CHANGELIST env var (the var will be -c xxxxxx)
			-	It's okay to go overboard, the calling program will revert any unchanged files in the changelist
		-	If you are compiling for IOS, please modify (and checkin) the project and make sure that arm64 is being compiled along with armv7/armv7s
	-	To test, just run the batch file from the root of the lib!
		-	Unless you set the THIRD_PARTY_CHANGELIST env var, your script will check out into the default changelist
		-	You can also use the full program to test compiling all or a subset of libs:
			-	From Engine/Build/BatchFiles, do:
				-	RunUAT BuildThirdPartyLibs [-libs=lib1+lib2+lib3] [-changelist=NNNN]
			-	When you use this script, it won't submit to p4, so just revert when your done testing
	-	Once it's all done and you've checked in your scripts, update this file and mark the appropriate library/platform with the brownish background:
		-	\\epicgames.net\Root\UE3\Platforms\Docs\ThirdPartyLibraries.xlsx
	-	If you feel extra confident, you can run the Jenkins script to compile all libraries:
		-	http://jenkins/view/UE4/job/UE4_BuildThirdPartyLibs/
		-	This will check in all compiled libraries!
		-	I haven't tested how well it will indicate libraries that failed to compile. It will check in the ones that worked, and revert the ones that aren't updated.
		-	This is first pass of the Jenkins job, but we really need a lot of libraries being compiled to really abuse it!
