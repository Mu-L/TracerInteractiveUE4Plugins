 * Implements a lock-free first-in first-out queue using a circular array.

 * always reads and the second thread always writes. The head and tail indices are
 * stored in volatile memory to prevent the compiler from reordering the instructions
 * that are meant to update the indices AFTER items have been inserted or removed.
 *
 * The number of items that can be enqueued is one less than the queue's capacity,
 * because one item will be used for detecting full and empty states.
