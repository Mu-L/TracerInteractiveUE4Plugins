 * Of course you can create several IFileCacheHandle's on separate threads if needed. And obviously Internally threading
 * will also be used to do async IO and cache management.
 * 
 * Also note, if you create several IFileCacheHandle's to the same file on separate threads these will be considered
 * as individual separate files from the cache point of view and thus each will have their own cache data allocated.
