 * it, pass 0 to 'out' and 'maxbytes', in which case the function will
 * return the number of bytes (including the terminating zero) that 
 * will be needed to hold the full callstack. Note that this might be 
 * fully accurate since subsequent calls will carry different line 
 * numbers, so it is best to allocate a few bytes extra to be safe.
