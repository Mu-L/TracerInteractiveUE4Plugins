/**
 * Implements a scope lock.
 *
 * This is a utility class that handles scope level locking. It's very useful
 * to keep from causing deadlocks due to exceptions being caught and knowing
 * about the number of locks a given thread has on a resource. Example:
 *
 * <code>
 *	{
 *		// Synchronize thread access to the following data
 *		FScopeLock ScopeLock(SynchObject);
 *		// Access data that is shared among multiple threads
 *		...
 *		// When ScopeLock goes out of scope, other threads can access data
 *	}
 * </code>
