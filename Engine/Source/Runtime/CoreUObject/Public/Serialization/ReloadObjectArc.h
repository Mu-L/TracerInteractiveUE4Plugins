/**
 * Archive for reloading UObjects without requiring the UObject to be completely unloaded.
 * Used for easily repropagating defaults to UObjects after class data has been changed.
 * Aggregates FMemoryReader and FMemoryWriter to encapsulate management and coordination 
 * of the UObject data being saved/loaded.
 * <p>
 * UObject references are not serialized directly into the memory archive.  Instead, we use
 * a system similar to the Export/ImportMap of FLinker - the pointer to the UObject is added
 * to a persistent (from the standpoint of the FReloadObjectArc) array.  The location into
 * this array is what is actually stored in the archive's buffer.
 * <p>
 * This is primarily necessary for loading UObject references from the memory archive.  The
 * UObject pointer ref. passed into the UObject overloaded serialization operator is not
 * guaranteed to be valid when reading data from the memory archive.  Since we need to determine
 * whether we *should* serialize the object before we actually do, we must introduce a level of
 * indirection.  Using the index retrieved from the archive's buffer, we can look at the UObject
 * before we attempt to serialize it.
