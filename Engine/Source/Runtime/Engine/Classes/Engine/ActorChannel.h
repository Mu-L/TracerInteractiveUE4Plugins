/**
 * A channel for exchanging actor and its subobject's properties and RPCs.
 *
 * ActorChannel manages the creation and lifetime of a replicated actor. Actual replication of properties and RPCs
 * actually happens in FObjectReplicator now (see DataReplication.h).
 *
 * An ActorChannel bunch looks like this:
 *
 * +----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------+
 * | SpawnInfo            | (Spawn Info) Initial bunch only                                           |
 * |  -Actor Class        |   -Created by ActorChannel                                                |

	//		RepKey - this is an idenifier for the current replicated state. 
	//
	//	ObjID should be constant per object or "category". Its up to the game code. For example the game code could use 0 to determine if an entire array is dirty,
	//	then usen 1-N for each subobject in that list. Or it could have 5 arrays using 0-4, and then use 100*ArrayNum + idx for the items in the array.
	//
	//	RepKey should change as the subobject changes. Each time a subobject is marked dirty, its RepKey should change.
	//
	//	GameCode should call ::KeyNeedsToReplicate(ObjID, RepKey) to determine if it needs to replicate. For example:
