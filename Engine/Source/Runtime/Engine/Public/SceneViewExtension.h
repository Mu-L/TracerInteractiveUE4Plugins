/**
 *  SCENE VIEW EXTENSIONS
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  This system lets you hook various aspects of UE4 rendering.
 *  To create a view extension, it is advisable to inherit
 *  from FSceneViewExtensionBase, which implements the 
 *  ISceneViewExtension interface.
 *
 *
 *  
 *  INHERITING, INSTANTIATING, LIFETIME
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  In order to inherit from FSceneViewExtensionBase, do the following:
 *
 *      class FMyExtension : public FSceneViewExtensionBase
 *      {
 *          public:
 *          FMyExtension( const FAutoRegister& AutoRegister, FYourParam1 Param1, FYourParam2 Param2 )
 *          : FSceneViewExtensionBase( AutoRegister )
 *          {
 *          }
 *      };
 *  
 *  Notice that your first argument must be FAutoRegister, and you must pass it
 *  to FSceneViewExtensionBase constructor. To instantiate your extension and register
 *  it, do the following:
 *
 *      FSceneViewExtensions::NewExtension<FMyExtension>(Param1, Param2);
 *
 *  You should maintain a reference to the extension for as long as you want to
 *  keep it registered.
 *
 *      TSharedRef<FMyExtension,ESPMode::ThreadSafe> MyExtension;
 *      MyExtension = FSceneViewExtensions::NewExtension<FMyExtension>(Param1, Param2);
 *
 *  If you follow this pattern, the cleanup of the extension will be safe and automatic
 *  whenever the `MyExtension` reference goes out of scope. In most cases, the `MyExtension`
 *  variable should be a member of the class owning the extension instance.
 *  
 *  The engine will keep the extension alive for the duration of the current frame to allow
 *  the render thread to finish.
 *
 *
 *
 *  OPTING OUT of RUNNING
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *  Each frame, the engine will invoke ISceneVewExtension::IsActiveThisFrame() to determine
 *  if your extension wants to run this frame. Returning false will cause none of the methods
 *  to be called this frame. The IsActiveThisFrame() method will be invoked again next frame.
 *
 *  If you need fine grained control over individual methods, your IsActiveThisFrame should
 *  return `true` and gate each method as needed.
 *
 *
 *
 *  PRIORITY
 *  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 *  Extensions are executed in priority order. Higher priority extensions run first.
 *  To determine the priority of your extension, override ISceneViewExtension::GetPriority();
 *
