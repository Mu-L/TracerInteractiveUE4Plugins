/**
 * Base object interface for solver objects. Defines the expected API for objects
 * uses CRTP for static dispatch, entire API considered "pure-virtual" and must be* defined.
 * Forgetting to implement any of the interface functions will give errors regarding
 * recursion on all control paths for TPhysicsProxy<T> where T will be the type
 * that has not correctly implemented the API.
 *
 * PersistentTask uses IPhysicsProxyBase, so when implementing a new specialized type
 * it is necessary to include its header file in PersistentTask.cpp allowing the linker
 * to properly resolve the new type. 
 *
 * May not be necessary overall once the engine has solidified - we can just use the
 * final concrete objects but this gives us almost the same flexibility as the old
 * callbacks while solving most of the drawbacks (virtual dispatch, cross-object interaction)
 *
 * #BG TODO - rename the callbacks functions, document for the base solver object
