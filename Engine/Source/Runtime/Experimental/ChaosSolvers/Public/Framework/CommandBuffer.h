	 * \class Chaos::FCommandList
	 * \brief Physics command list
	 *
	 * When performing complex interactions with the physics engine it may be desirable
	 * to have a batch of commands in a way that ensures all commands are executed together
	 * before a physics tick. For this case use a command list, enqueueing all commands to the
	 * list and calling flush when finished.
	 *
	 * If you have an object that does this often just keep an FCommandList as a member as each
	 * call to flush will submit the commands to the physics dispatcher and prepare for a new
	 * batch, for repeated use this is better than creating a temporary to submit commands.
	 *
	 * Example usage:
	 * FCommandList MyList;
	 * MyList.Enqueue([](){
	 *     // Do command body 1
	 * });
	 * MyList.Enqueue([](){
	 *     // Do command body 2
	 * });
	 * MyList.Enqueue([](){
	 *     // Do command body 3
	 * });
	 * MyList.Flush();
