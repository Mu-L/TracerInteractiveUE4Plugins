	 * Physics command dispatcher
	 *
	 * Used to safely interact with Chaos physics data. When performing any operation that needs to affect live
	 * physics data such as modifying simulation data (positions, velocities etc.) make sure that this code
	 * is placed with in an appropriate command.
	 *
	 * Command Types:
	 *
	 *		* Global -  First commands to run in a batch, no parameters, if your command doesn't interact
	 *					with a solver, this is probably what you need. This will run at the beginning of
	 *					a physics tick before task or solver commands
	 *
	 *		* Task -	Ran immediately after the global commands, takes a ptr to the actual physics task
	 *					that is running if we are in dedicated thread mode, nullptr otherwise. Although this
	 *					command type knows about the underlying threading model care should be taken when using
	 *					this command type to make sure it also accomplishes its goal in non-dedicated threading modes.
	 *					Only use if absolutely necessary
	 *
	 *		* Solver -	Another useful command, is bound to a solver. Runs after the task commands have all run.
	 *					Maybe all be ran in different threads. The solver pointer passed to the command is safe
	 *					to read and write from (as should be any captured object handles) but do not attempt to
	 *					access other solvers, or other off-thread data as this will not be safe when running in
	 *					any threading model that is not single-threaded
	 *
	 * A note on batched commands and command lists:
	 *		Batched commands and command lists are consistent with the above ordering of commands but only within
	 *		that specific batch. If two batched A and B are submitted then the execution order of the commands is:
	 *				A.Global -> A.Task -> A.Solver -> B.Global -> B.Task -> B.Solver
