 * Workaround function to avoid circular dependencies between Launch and CommonLinuxStartup modules.
 *
 * Other platforms call FEngineLoop::AppExit() in their main() (removed by preprocessor if compiled without engine), but on Linux we want to share a common main() in CommonLinuxStartup module,
 * so not just the engine but all the programs could share this logic. Unfortunately, AppExit() practice breaks this nice approach since FEngineLoop cannot be moved outside of Launch without
 * making too many changes. Hence CommonLinuxMain will call it through this function if WITH_ENGINE is defined.
 *
 * If you change the prototype here, update CommonLinuxMain() too!
