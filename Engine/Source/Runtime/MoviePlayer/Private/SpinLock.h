/**
 * Simple primitive for setting spin locks up.
 * Is lockable from any thread, and any thread can block on the lock.
 * However, the spin lock should never be destroyed while any thread is using it.
 *
 * Spin locks are useful when the amount of time spinning is expected to be minor,
 * so no time is wasted doing a context switch. An adaptive mutex would probably work
 * better though.
