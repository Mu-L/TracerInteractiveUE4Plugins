/**
 * Struct type that is bound to a blueprint function entry node, and resolved to a cached UFunction when the blueprint/track is recompiled.
 * Events can be bound to either of the following function signatures:
 *
 *   1. A function with no parameters (and no return value).
 *     - Compatible with master tracks or object bindings
 *     - No context passed through to event

 *   2. A function with a single object or interface parameter (and no return value).
 *     - Compatible with master tracks or object bindings
 *     - Will be triggered with objects in the following order:
 *         - Objects bound to the track's object binding, or:
 *         - Objects specified on the track's event receivers array, or:
 *         - Objects provided by the playback context.
 *     - Will only trigger if the specified object is of the same type as the parameter (or interface)
