/** 
 * Slate Stats System Motivation
 * ---------------------------
 * Slate uses it's own stats system to gather performance metrics. There are a few reasons it does not use the builtin UE4 stats system:
 *   1. UE4 stats are threadsafe, thus heavier weight. Slate is single-threaded by nature due to UI constraints.
 *   2. Slate stats can optionally carry additional context (like class or debug info) used to provide more info when digesting the profile.
 *   3. Using a lighter weight system allows us to add more tracking by default.
 *   4. Slate uses a custom hierarchical system that allows it to spit out a CSV containing a complete hierarchical inclusive/exclusive profile.
 * 
 * Slate Stats System Overview
 * ---------------------------
 * You need to declare your stat globally somewhere. It should generally be a static variable:
 * 
 *   SLATE_DECLARE_CYCLE_COUNTER(GSlateOnPaint, "OnPaint");
 * 
 * Next you go the scope of code to provide and add a scope counter (the types will be explained below).
 * 
 *   SLATE_CYCLE_COUNTER_SCOPE(GSlateOnPaint);
 * 
 * This enables the Slate Stats system to track this scope of code and associate it with the "OnPaint" stat.
 * If you want to track the OnPaint call of each type of widget separately, you would use the _CUSTOM version of the macro and provide it with
 * an FName to track along with the stat like so (assuming "this" is an SWidget):
 * 
 *   SLATE_CYCLE_COUNTER_SCOPE_CUSTOM(GSlateOnPaint, GetType());
 * 
 * However, note that custom info is only available when doing a full hierarchical capture (as explained below).
 * 
 * Slate supports two modes of stats - flat and hierarchical. Stats are hierarchical by default. Use the _FLAT form of the macro 
 * to declare a stat that is only used for flattened tracking. This is faster when you don't need this stat for a full hierarchical profile.
 *
 *   Flat
 *   ----
 *   Flat view is a standard inclusive sum of cycles. Each scope simply records a start and end time and adds it to the global stat accumulator.
 *   This happens until the system is told to display the values, at which point it averages the cycle accumulators over the number of frames since
 *   the last summary. The resultant view is essentially a list of all declared stats along with the average inclusive time spent in that stat's scope. 
 *   
 *   The system handles re-entrant stats. So if you are processing a hierarchy (as Slate widgets essentially are), re-entering the same stat will do
 *   nothing until the last scope is exited.
 *   
 *   Hierarchical
 *   ------------
 *   Hierarchical capture essentially creates a complete hierarchical profile of a frame. Since it has to track EACH stat entry that frame, it can
 *   have a non-trivial performance and memory impact on the application. However, the result is similar to the data from a fully instrumented profile
 *   of your application, with a few notable details:
 *     1. You are instrumenting sections of code, not functions. This allows for finer-grained classification of your code.
 *     2. each entry also carries any context you passed it at runtime, allowing for even better context than an instrumented profiler can give you.
 *     3. Stats are not subject to the whims of inlining, etc, since they are injected at compile-time.
 *   While Slate goes out of its way to make this capture as cheap as possible, there is a lot of data being gathered each frame. Therefore, Slate does NOT
 *   do a hierarchical capture continually. Instead, the stats system must be triggered (programmatically) to enable hierarchical capture right before a 
 *   frame is started. This is done when calling EndFrame() on the FSlateStatHierarchy singleton:
 *   
 *     FSlateStatHierarchy::Get().EndFrame(true|false);
 *     
 *   This can be triggered by end users through the Slate.Stats.Hierarchy.Trigger cvar.
 *   
 *   Since there is no guarantee that the stat call stack will be equivalent from one frame to the next, we can only accumulate ONE frame.
 *   
 *   When a hierarchical capture frame ends, Slate does some additional work to gather up all instances, derive "full paths" to each entry, and derive
 *   the exclusive time for that instance. Again, Slate tries to do this as fast as possible, but there can be 100,000s of entries in a frame, so that
 *   can only be as fast as those entries can be traversed. When finished, Slate spits out a CSV into the Saved/ folder containing the following fields:
 *     1. Path - full path to the entry. 
 *     2. Stat Description
 *     3. Stat additional context (Custom info)
 *     4. Inclusive time
 *     5. Exclusive time
 *     
 *   Path is essentially a pathway through the hierarchy of samples to the entry (a stat call-stack if you will). This allows analysis tools to understand 
 *   the capture hierarchy so they can do things like restrict to subtrees of the capture, create caller-callee views, etc. Essentially typical instrumented 
 *   profiler things.
 * 
 * FSlateStatCycleCounter - Global storage of a cycle stat. This should be declared as a global using the SLATE_DECLARE_CYCLE_COUNTER macro.
 * Counters don't update themselves, they rely on the scope classes to update their values.
 * All the methods of this class are essentially internal and there is no need for an end-user to call them directly.
