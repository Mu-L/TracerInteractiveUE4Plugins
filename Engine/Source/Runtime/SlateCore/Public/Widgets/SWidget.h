 * Inheritance:
 *   Widget is not meant to be directly inherited. Instead consider inheriting from LeafWidget or Panel,
 *   which represent intended use cases and provide a succinct set of methods which to override.
 *
 *   SWidget is the base class for all interactive Slate entities. SWidget's public interface describes
 *   everything that a Widget can do and is fairly complex as a result.
 * 
 * Events:
 *   Events in Slate are implemented as virtual functions that the Slate system will call
 *   on a Widget in order to notify the Widget about an important occurrence (e.g. a key press)
 *   or querying the Widget regarding some information (e.g. what mouse cursor should be displayed).
 *
 *   Widget provides a default implementation for most events; the default implementation does nothing
 *   and does not handle the event.
 *
 *   Some events are able to reply to the system by returning an FReply, FCursorReply, or similar
 *   object.
