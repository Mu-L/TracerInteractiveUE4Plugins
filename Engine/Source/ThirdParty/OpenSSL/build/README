=======
You must install Perl and 7zip to build the openssl libraries
run uncompress_and_patch.bat <version to build>. This will uncompress the tar.gz package in <version to build> and apply any patches using xcopy.
To build the library for all compilers and architectures run build_openssl_win_all.bat <version to build>.
   This will build the libraries and deploy them in the <version to build> subdirectory of the openssl root.

Mac OSX
=======
run build_openssl.sh <version to build>

Adding support for other Unix-like platforms
============================================
Edit build_openssl.sh and extend the first condifional block to define the correct values for the following variables:
* OPENSSL_DESTINATION_RELEASE
* BUILD_FINAL_DESTINATION
* OPENSSL_CONFIG_RELEASE
See the values specified for Mac OS X and the INSTALL file inside the openssl source archive for more information.
