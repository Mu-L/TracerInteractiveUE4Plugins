* Added support for building as mac arm64
* Needed some warnings turned off for x64 with modern clang
* Had to update CMakeLists.txt in PxShared, PhysX_3.4, and Apec_1.4 to support using CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES argument to detect arm64 vs x86_64
    * Using arguments for iOS libs
    * Does not build with SIMD disabled! (PX_SIMD_DISABLED)
    * Enabled Neon

PhysX3/PhysX_3.4/Source/compiler/cmake/mac/CMakeLists.txt
PhysX3/PxShared/src/compiler/cmake/mac/CMakeLists.txt

* Had to fix headers in Apex/Cloth that assumed different Neon includes / functions
