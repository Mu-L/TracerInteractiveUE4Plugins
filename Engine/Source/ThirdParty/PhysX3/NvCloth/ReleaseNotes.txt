Fixed:
Dynamic allocations at runtime removed from MovingAverage.
Possible error when starting samples due to gpu incompatible with dx debug mode.

New:
Added cmake flags to disable dx11 and/or cuda support.

Known issues:
DirectX 11 solver has issues with ccd sphere/capsule collision.


[1.1.1]
Fixed:
Air drag/lift did react to flow speed only linearly, model was changed to be more physically correct.
Fixed issue where scaling units would result in different air drag/lift behavior (by adding fluid density parameter).
Fixed "unused typedef `__t100`" warning in xcode.

Known issues:
DirectX 11 solver has issues with ccd sphere/capsule collision.

[1.1.0]
Fixed:
DirectX 11 solver now supports triangle collision shapes and air drag/lift.
Fixed bug where changing friction on cloth already in simulation would cause assert or crash.
Optimization flag now working on PS4 release build.

New:
Solver::getNumCloths and Solver::getClothList interface.
Improved samples (new scenes and debug visualization)


Known issues:
DirectX 11 solver has issues with ccd sphere/capsule collision.

[1.0.0]
Known issues:
DirectX 11 solver doesn’t support triangle collision shapes and air drag/lift
